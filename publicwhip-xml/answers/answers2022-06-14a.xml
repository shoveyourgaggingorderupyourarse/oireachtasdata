    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400062#WRB00500"><p>I have noted the recent publication from the Parliamentary Budget Office, <i>An Overview of Ireland&rsquo;s Electric Vehicle Incentives</i><i>and a Comparison With International Peers, </i>to which the Deputy referred. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2021 Climate Action Plan. Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p><p>Considerable progress has been made to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including</p><p>- EV Purchase Grant Scheme of up to &euro;5000 for BEVs</p><p>- EV Home Charger Grant of Up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs.</p><p>- Low Motor Tax - BEVs qualify for the lowest tax band of motor tax at &euro;120 per annum, while a PHEV is typically taxed at circa &euro;170 per annum.</p><p>- VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs.</p><p>- BEVs qualify for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions.</p><p>- BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles</p><p>- A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with up to &euro;20K available for a new BEV, &euro;25K for a new wheelchair accessible BEV and &euro;15K for a new wheelchair accessible PHEV.</p><p>- Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme - grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent.</p><p>These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base in 2017, to over 58,000 by end April 2022. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers and that supply chain issues globally have also proven difficult. These have been exacerbated by international events. For these reasons, our policy measures here are kept under continuous review. In this context, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This Group considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption and recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. </p><p>An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures to drive the adoption of the EVs. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.</p><p>The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.</p><p>Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI). This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. Government will also deliver a high quality seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and en-route or motorway charging. </p><p>As outlined above, a grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>-  Seventeenhigh-powerchargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations and delivery of new, faster and higher capacity technology is awaited to complete this element of the program, due in August and the upgrade program will resume then.  The remaining locations have all been identified and surveyed.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i><i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p><p>Finally, my Department is developing new grant schemes which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations including hotels, car parks and visitor and tourist attractions, both State-owned and commercial sites. This new initiative will  be open for applications from both the public and private sector and help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400062#WRB00800"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for this question.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Shannon Group informed the Department in Summer 2020 that it was necessary to consider a comprehensive and radical adjustment to its structure to secure the long-term future of the Shannon Heritage business and its employees. A number of challenges had arisen, including the lack of expertise in the Group for maintaining the heritage sites; the capital investment required to maintain and preserve the heritage sites arising from a lack of investment over time; and the impact of the onset of COVID-19 on Shannon Group which is heavily dependent on inward tourism.</p>  <p>  Shannon Group has had extensive engagement with the relevant local authorities since early last year. Shannon Heritage ended their management contracts with An Post and Fingal County Council for sites in Dublin on 31 December 2021 and the transfer of the business and employees took place without issue.   King John&rsquo;s Castle was successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April. I would like to acknowledge the extensive preparation and cooperation between Shannon Group and Fingal County Council, Limerick County Council and An Post for the smooth transfer of these sites.   </p>  <p>  Shannon Group continues to engage with Clare County Council in relation to the proposed transfer of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen, Knappogue Castle, and Cliffs of Moher Retail Outlet. The Department is engaging regularly with both parties with a view to progressing the transfer preparations. </p>  <p>  As part of its engagement, Clare County Council has identified a funding gap which it is seeking government assistance on in order to be in a position to take over the sites.  The Department established an inter-departmental working group, made up of key stakeholders, to consider these funding requirements. Stakeholders include the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the OPW, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.</p>  <p>  The Group held its first meeting on 19 May and its second on 9 June. The Group will meet again later this month. I would like to thank the representatives for their positive engagement at the meetings held to date. </p>  <p>  Once the remaining issues around the transfer are resolved, particularly in relation to funding, Shannon Group will be in a position to seek the formal consent of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to execute the transfer of the business and the relevant heritage sites and this will be done with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Government recognises the importance of these sites to the mid-west region, and that this Government will continue to support Shannon Group to ensure that the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and heritage sites will proceed as planned with a view to ensuring the long-term viability and success of the business.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Study is to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city.</p><p>The Study focused on addressing four main challenges facing our cities: decarbonisation, air quality, congestion, and improving the overall urban environment.</p><p>It is therefore not explicitly focused on improving the efficiency of public transport or enhancing the safety of active travellers, though these benefits are certainly intended to result from implementation of measures identified in the Study.</p><p>In line with our <i>Climate Action Plan</i>commitments, my Department is continuing to engage with the NTA, the Regional Assemblies, and other bodies to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025.  </p><p>With regard to specific measures, the Study recommended three priority measures to progress further for implementation across the five cities:</p><p>- Developing and embedding the concept of 15-minute neighbourhoods through national and local plans and strategies, providing resources to incentivise their implementation through national funding or grants schemes;</p><p>- Enhancing delivery of the National Planning Framework; and</p><p>- Implementing public parking controls.</p><p>In relation to Dublin City specifically, the NTA is currently assessing potential demand management measures to achieve the transport emissions targets in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) for 2030, in line with the draft <i>GDA Transportation Strategy 2022-2042</i>.</p><p>In addition, with regard to sustainable mobility and active travel, my Department has recently published its <i>Sustainable Mobility Policy </i>and associated suite of actions which aim to deliver at least 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys and a 10% reduction in kilometres driven by fossil fuelled cars by 2030.  In this regard, I have recently established a Leadership Group and Delivery team to oversee and drive implementation of the Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP) and delivery of its action plan over the next three years.</p><p>These actions are intended to change our daily travel choices by making it both easier and more attractive for people to travel by more sustainable modes &ndash; be that walking, cycling or public transport.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400062#WRB02000"><p>The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement signals a switch from the current bioethanol blend in petrol from 5% to 10% in petrol by 2023, subject to supporting legislation. This will achieve the Climate Action Plan&rsquo;s commitment to increase the level of bioethanol blended into petrol in advance of the target date set out in that strategy. This would also be in step with the change in place in 2021 in the UK and planned for Northern Ireland. </p><p>The Minister for Transport published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement in November 2021. The Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to address Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive. It supports the actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and increase the share of renewable fuels in the national Climate Action Plan 2021 and our international obligations, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>The use of biofuels is currently one of the main pillars of land transport decarbonisation. Since 2010, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel supply through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers.</p><p>The obligation ensures that a certain percentage (currently 13% by volume) of the motor fuel placed on the market comes from renewable sources, for example bioethanol and biodiesel. In 2020 alone, 239 million litres of biofuels replaced about 209 million litres of fossil fuels, avoiding approximately 520 Kilo tonnes CO2 equivalent. GHG emissions. </p><p>Biofuels will remain a core transitional measure for medium-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in road transport. This is particularly so for hard to abate sectors such as heavy-duty vehicles, where alternative transport energy and technology are at early and varying stages of development. However,  concerns exist regarding the source, production, traceability and sustainability of the feedstocks for biofuels. The Department of Transport is currently carrying out a study on the sustainability and availability of bio- and renewable fuels supply and demand in transport. This study will help to inform the development of the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy over the coming years, with due regard to the ambitious domestic targets for renewable fuels in the Climate Action Plan and proposed future European obligations for renewable fuels.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan states that Government will <i>&ldquo;Carry out a review of the supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, green hydrogen, and biogas.&rdquo;</i>As a key step to deliver this action, the Department of Transport is progressing a study reviewing the profile, sustainability, and supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, biogas, and green hydrogen. This work is being carried out under DECC&rsquo;s Climate Action Modelling Group (CAMG) with additional input from NORA and will be delivered this year.</p><p>The Policy proposes measures to achieve higher rates of biofuel blending in transport fuel supply annually to achieve the Climate Action Plan target of 10% bioethanol in petrol and 20% biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy statement sets out that, to achieve this Climate Action Plan 2021 target for biofuel blending, indicative increases of a further 3% increase in the obligation will be put in place in 2024 and 4% in 2025. Further consideration of the indicative trajectory from 2025 to 2030 will give due regard to domestic obligations and the European Union&rsquo;s Fit for 55 package of climate measures.</p><p>In addition, the Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy aims to further incentivise the supply of advanced renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. Further, as part of the suite of policy measures set out in the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement, from 2023 and subject to legislation, an advanced biofuel obligation will be put in place as part of the overall renewable fuels for transport obligation. </p><p>This will require obligated parties to place a proportion of advanced biofuels that are produced from waste materials specified by the European Commission within the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) on the market as part of their overall blending obligation. From 2023, the advanced biofuel obligation rate will be an indicative of 0.3% by energy and the indicative trajectory of increase for the advanced biofuel obligation will increase out to 2030. Stakeholder views on the rate of this trajectory were sought as part of the recent public consultation on the renewable fuels for transport policy and these views are currently being considered by my Department as part of the ongoing analysis of submissions received. </p><p>The renewable fuels for transport policy has been subject to stakeholder engagement and consultation throughout 2022. This will, in conjunction with the current research on the sustainability and availability of renewable transport fuels, help to inform the next iteration of the policy which will be published in 2023.</p></reply>

Neither I as Minister for Transport, nor my department, have a direct role in operational matters, including the demand management process for test appointments. However, I am very aware of the serious challenges that the RSA and the NCTS are currently facing to meet demand and the frustrating delays which vehicle owners have encountered since the start of this year. I would like to thank Deputy Richmond and our other colleagues for raising this important matter.  </p>  <p>  Since January of this year, the NCTS has reported a severe testing backlog and a higher-than-usual rate of test cancellations. The average lead time for an appointment has almost doubled from a pre-pandemic average of 12 days to just over 23 days. I understand that this has been caused by a number of factors. Notably, the service experienced extremely high demand for test appointments in the first months of the year, in conjunction with the continuing impact of Covid-19 on staff and customers and long-term challenges to recruit suitably qualified staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA is overseeing the NCTS response to address the backlog. A priority waiting list system has been established to allow vehicle owners who urgently need a test date to avail of appointments made available through cancellations. The RSA has indicated that 99% of customers are given a test date within 28 days.</p>  <p>  My department has additionally been informed that the NCTS has taken a number of steps in the immediate term to provide additional capacity at test centres, including staff overtime and longer shift schedules. However, in the longer-term, the recruitment of suitably qualified vehicle inspection staff (QQI Level 6) remains challenging. As I understand it, the RSA has agreed that NCTS may pilot the use of additional personnel at QQI Level 5 for a 12-month period to assist with automated elements of the test process in order to increase overall capacity. There are 15 vehicle Inspectors to commence training this month, with further intakes of staff planned from August onwards.</p>  <p>  A decrease in the current high NCT waiting times will depend on recruitment and the net increase in staffing towards a target of 620 additional personnel. It is expected to be the end of 2022 before capacity meets demand.</p>  <p>  This is a serious matter and I and my department will continue to monitor the RSA's progress to reduce test delays closely as part of ongoing corporate governance processes.</p></reply>

I am committed to placing Ireland on the right track to achieve zero-emission mobility by at least 2050. Our public transport operators are central to this goal, leading by example and demonstrating that change is possible and positive. </p>  <p>  As the largest public transport company in the state, Dublin Bus is acutely aware of their responsibility to embed sustainable practices in every aspect of their business from their buses to the travel patterns of their own employees. The company currently has 24 charging points across five locations as well as a policy that, where suitable, electric vehicles are to be used for pooled cars/vans. Dublin Bus are also committed to a replacement programme to transition their existing pooled diesel cars to zero emission alternatives where available. In line with their commitment to reduce the number of car journeys by the company in Dublin, including those made by their employees, the company has just launched a dedicated employee e-bike scheme. The new initiative, a pilot project to run for 12 months, is designed to provide employees with a more sustainable way to travel between the companies&rsquo; various locations.</p>  <p>  Similarly, GoAhead takes sustainability very seriously. They currently have three charging points at their Ballymount Depot for employee use. In the coming months, during an expansion of their depot, they plan on installing more charging points for staff and visitors. On top of this, the depot expansion works will allow for the completion of the initial ground works to future proof and accommodate electric bus charging. Furthermore, the company has three electric cars to support business needs along with plans to phase out their 7 diesel pooled cars over the next three years.</p>  <p>  I welcome yesterday's announcement by the National Transport Authority of an order for 120 double-deck battery-electric buses and an intention to procure up to 800 more over the next five years. Going electric will reduce the carbon footprint of our public transport fleet, and will help us reach our long-term climate goals.  Of the 120 buses currently on order, 100 are destined for use by Dublin Bus on PSO bus services within the Dublin Metropolitan Area and 20 are destined for use by Bus &Eacute;ireann for use in the Limerick Metropolitan Area. There is future provision for these electric buses to be introduced in Cork, Galway and Waterford</p>  <p>  Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department. Public transport operators have an important role to play in delivering on this priority in terms of providing sustainable transport for members of the public as well as for their own employees. While I am under no illusion as to the enormity of the task ahead of us, I am assured that our public transport operators are fully committed to achieve these objectives for their own companies, our communities, and our future.</p></reply>

At that time initial consideration was given to the themes that should be explored in such a new policy. While not fully settled, included for consideration were issues such as sustainability, connectivity, infrastructure and operations. Regrettably with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic this work was paused as there was an immediate need to focus on ensuring that the aviation sector could survive the crisis. </p>  <p>  No-one could have predicted how long the pandemic would last, and just as the industry began to emerge from the worst of the crisis, we found ourselves faced with a crisis of a different kind in the form of the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  My department fully intends to resume work on a full National Aviation Policy within the next six months. Obviously there are many different challenges now facing the industry which will need to be given appropriate attention. I have outlined some of these already, but it is important to restate again the unprecedented challenge to decarbonise that the industry is facing, including the obligations that arise from the various measures under the Fit for 55 package. All of these issues will be assessed. </p>  <p>  As I stated earlier, there are many elements of the existing National Aviation Policy which remain relevant. One issue that was highlighted during the preparation of that policy is that our airport network is extensive for a small country with a population of approximately 5 million, which represents a challenge for individual airports in a limited market. I have already mentioned some of the measures that are in place to ensure that our regional airports are equipped to facilitate and attract air services from operators such as the new Regional Airports Programme 2021 to 2025 which was published by my Department last year and supports Ireland's smallest airports.  </p>  <p>  Once work has resumed on the policy, the process will include a comprehensive public consultation as well as close engagement with the aviation industry, likely through the structures of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum.</p></reply>

Supports under this Programme are targeted at safety and security activities and operations,  assisting our regional airports to ensure they comply with international regulatory requirements in these areas. Funding also supports sustainability objectives, enabling these airports to identify and implement climate related efficiencies and build resilience against the likely impacts of climate change.</p><p>During 2021, &euro;5.7m in capital funding was allocated to our smaller regional airports (Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry).  A further &euro;2.8m in operational supports were also provided to these airports, which funded 100% of all eligible non-economic operating costs in the areas of safety and security in 2021.</p><p>While Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry Airports have remained eligible for funding under the Programme in 2022, by virtue of their size and passenger numbers, Shannon and Cork regional State airports have never, before now, been eligible for funding (although funded separately under a one year COVID 19 Regional State Airports Programme in 2021).  However, due to suppressed passenger numbers in 2020 and 2021, as a direct result of Covid, both of these regional State airports have become eligible for funding under the Programme in 2022.</p><p>From an overall budget of &euro;44 million available under this Programme in 2022, on 19<sup>th</sup>April last, I was pleased to announce capital funding allocations totalling almost &euro;16.4m for 2022. This capital funding is broken down by airport as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Airports </th>       <th>2022 Capital Funding Allocations </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shannon </td>       <td>&euro;4.3m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>&euro;5.5m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ireland West </td>       <td>&euro;4.8m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>&euro;0.7m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>&euro;1.1m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL ALLOCATIONS </td>       <td>&euro;16.4m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The above airports will also be eligible to apply for operational funding, later this year, under the Programme.  Almost &euro;22 million  in operational support is available in 2022 to support air traffic control, fire services and security related operations at airports. This funding will support these airports as they recover from the impacts of COVID and grow into the future.</p><p>As Government policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity &ndash; both for social and economic benefits,  in  addition to funding being made directly to airports, the Regional Airports Programme also supports regional connectivity via Public Service Obligation (PSO) air services to remote regions.  </p><p>Currently one PSO route operates between Donegal and Dublin, providing the people and businesses in the North-West with twice daily two-way air services.  The current PSO contract on this route commenced on 26th February 2022. This PSO service marks Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring continued connectivity to this region for the next 3 years.  In line with Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development, this service will support growth of the economy and tourism in the region.</p></reply>

And while I recognise the importance of incentivising greater use of our public transport services, I am not convinced that providing free public transport is the most balanced means of achieving this objective. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, funding for the provision of public transport services is made up of both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  COVID gave us some insight into the level of funding that might be required in the absence of fare revenue. For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of public transport services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal undoubtedly impacts the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services. </p>  <p>  While free or significantly subsidised public transport is available in some European locations, I understand that results have varied or have yet to be seen as per the German initiative referenced in the Deputy's question. The intention is always commendable - encouraging modal shift, reducing congestion, and capitalising on the associated environmental benefits. However, such schemes can have unintended consequences, for example encouraging people away from active travel modes. This is counter to our core Government goals of improving citizen&rsquo;s health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides the answer - I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck. In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, I was delighted to introduce the Young Adult Card in May which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an average of discount of 50% on public transport fares. In addition, a 20% average PSO fare reduction was introduced as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. </p>  <p>  In summary, funding our public transport services represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding levels have increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would need to be considered carefully and in full awareness of their potential impact on finite Exchequer resources. I will of course stay informed on how alternative incentives, like the German &euro;9 ticket, develop.   </p></reply>

The framework will guide high-level strategic planning and development of the UAS sector with the aim of supporting growth and innovation while managing safety, security, privacy and other aspects. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged extensively with primary stakeholders from relevant Government Departments and agencies to facilitate the development of a comprehensive and integrated policy. In July 2021, an Interdepartmental Steering Group was established, followed by the establishment of three working groups to focus on the key areas of compliance and enforcement, U-Space and planning, and enterprise development and networks. The three working groups reported back to the Steering Group in December 2021. A targeted stakeholder consultation was held in March 2022.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating the work of the working groups and the submissions received from the targeted stakeholders into a draft policy framework document.  A public consultation is anticipated in Q3 of 2022, with the aim of a finalised policy framework for unmanned aircraft systems being published by end of this year. </p>  <p>  I am aware that privacy rights are linked to societal acceptance of the use of UAS. With this in mind, my Department ensured that the Department of Justice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner were appropriately represented on the working groups. My Department will continue to work closely with the Office of the Data Protection Commission as the policy framework is developed further. Data privacy considerations and the oversight and enforcement role of the Data Protection Commissioner will be integrated into the final policy framework.</p></reply>

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme provided support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. </p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport. On 19 May 2022, Minister Ryan and I announced the extension of the closing date for receipt of completed applications to close of business 6 June 2022. Over &euro;15 million has been paid out under the Scheme to 2,923 licensed operators. Further eligible applications received will be processed over the coming days and final payments will be made shortly.  I can confirm the Scheme is now closed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), this is a matter for my colleague Minister Donohoe. It should be noted however that support under the Scheme was increased in Budget 2020. In light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.43 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre and in recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase in the DRS has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. </p></reply>

My Department has no current plans to establish an innovation hub for sustainable aviation in Shannon. </p>  <p>  The term sustainable aviation is a broad reaching one and can refer to a range of actions by various elements within the aviation industry, such as improved aircraft technology, more efficient air traffic management, the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and the overall greening of our airports.</p>  <p>  As a &lsquo;technology taker&rsquo; Ireland does not currently have an indigenous aircraft or engine manufacturing industry and is unlikely to play a significant role in the development of new aircraft technology. However, there are a number of considerations relevant to the possibility of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovation in the Shannon region, namely its geographic location, close to a potential resource of offshore wind energy, and the existing infrastructure at Shannon Foynes Port. </p>  <p>  In terms of policy, the question of SAF development is a very current one.  Recently at the European Transport Council a General Approach was agreed among Member States, with support from Ireland, on how to proceed on the ReFuelEU Aviation proposal.  This will mandate the use of increasing levels of blended SAF between 2025 and 2050, including the introduction of a synthetic aviation fuel sub-mandate in 2030. A clear signal is being sent to industry that the market will be there when they begin to produce these fuels.</p>  <p>  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications will be preparing a national Hydrogen Strategy this year, which should help inform developments in this area.  Harnessing wind energy to generate hydrogen by electrolyser technology could potentially provide feedstock for a range of sustainable fuel uses including aviation.   </p>  <p>  Government has recently established the Shannon Estuary Economic Task Force, under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE).  The Taskforce will consider the strategic strengths and comparative advantages of the Shannon Estuary in the areas of transport and logistics, manufacturing, tourism, and renewable energy. Members of the Task Force include, amongst others, Shannon Group, ESB Generation and Trading, and Shannon Foynes Port. I understand that Wind, Hydro and Solar energy are some of the areas set to be examined, with the group aiming to produce an initial report by November of this year which I look forward to reviewing.</p></reply>

It was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully, cognisant of the fact that the replacement of a vehicle is a SPSV operator's single largest cost. </p>  <p>  Taking account of all these factors, there is no consideration being given to amending these age-related rules now, or again in the future.</p>  <p>  At the same time, there continue to be supports available to drivers who wish to change their vehicles.</p>  <p>  As part of my commitment to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles and the &lsquo;greening &lsquo; of the SPSV sector, I put in place the electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme. The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA.  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use, and &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric.  The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. When these grant offers are drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year. At this stage, I anticipate that the Scheme will re-open for applications during the summer, allowing SPSV operators to once again apply for the supports on offer.</p>  <p>  At the same time, Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support SPSV owners that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers and are availing of the eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.</p>  <p>  The availability of electric vehicles is unpredictable because of the ongoing difficulties with global vehicle production. The reasons for the vehicle supply shortages are varied, but it is largely centred on the effects of the pandemic. All vehicle production was shut down in the early stages of the pandemic, and an ongoing worldwide microprocessor shortage in the automotive sector is contributing to further delays in restoring vehicle production back to pre-pandemic levels. It has been reported that the shortage of microprocessors is unlikely to end soon, and automotive industry leaders have advised the issue will continue through 2022 and possibly even 2023. Since microprocessors are required for all vehicle production, so the shortage will equally affect the supply of petrol/diesel powered vehicles, and electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  Finally, the deputy will be aware of the NTA&rsquo;s recent proposal to introduce an average increase of 12% on taxi fares from 31st August 2022 as a result of the National Maximum Fares Review, which closed for public consultation on May 27th last.  This would be the first increase on such fares since 2017.  </p>  <p>  The approach taken by the NTA has been to weight the proposed increase in favour of the periods in which the premium hour rate may be charged by drivers, i.e. between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays / public holidays.  As already mentioned, there has been a large upswing in demand for taxi services, particularly for servicing the night-time economy and, while drivers are obviously free to choose their own hours of operation, the proposal to increase taxi fares, with a weighting towards the premium rate periods, is designed to encourage more taxi drivers to operate during those times, thus increasing their income, as well as the availability of taxis to passengers nationally.</p></reply>

These are a clear indication that we need to double down on implementation of climate action measures and that the transport sector is important to our decarbonisation efforts.  Improving sustainable transport infrastructure and services in all our cities, including Galway, is fundamental to reducing reliance on private car journeys and meeting our challenging climate targets.  </p>  <p>  I think it important to recognise that progress is being made with a number of significant projects currently being advanced in Galway to reduce car dependency and increase the numbers walking, cycling, and using public transport.  These projects are enabled by funding under the National Development Plan and guided by the Galway Transport Strategy.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Galway comprises a major enhancement to the bus system in the city.  The largest part of the programme is the development of bus priority measures inclusive of bus lanes throughout the city. Non-statutory public consultation processes were held in 2020 for two of the five proposed routes &ndash; the Dublin Road Scheme and the Cross City Link project.  Work has continued on finalising the two schemes and planning permission for the Cross City Link is expected to be sought this year.  It is expected that construction will also begin on the Salmon Weir pedestrian and cycling bridge this year.  The Dublin Road Scheme will enter the planning process next year.   </p>  <p>  Over the last year, the entirety of the Galway city bus fleet has been replaced with 40 new hybrid double-deck buses that operate in zero tailpipe emission mode when feasible. As well as significantly reducing emissions, these buses have also increased the available capacity on Galway city bus services.</p>  <p>  On rail, planning and design is continuing in relation to the proposed redevelopment of Ceannt Station and the improvements planned for Oranmore Station and track infrastructure.   This project will address short-term capacity constraints and enable rail frequency improvements in the region.   </p>  <p>  One of my key priorities for public transport is the rollout of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan to benefit people living outside our cities and towns.  Starting this year, new and improved services will be rolled out on a phased basis across the country, including county Galway.     </p>  <p>  Progress is also being made on improving active travel infrastructure in Galway.  A comprehensive cycle network is planned for the city as part of the Galway Transport Strategy.  Key elements of that network are being delivered through the BusConnects programme with a number of other links of the overall network under development.  Galway will also benefit from funding under the Safe Routes to School programme, with 11 schools across the city and county receiving funding in round one and additional schools set to enter the programme over the next few years. </p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing to work with the Deputy on improving sustainable mobility options  in Galway in the coming years, to help meet our climate targets and provide for better local communities.</p></reply>

Upon its finalisation a full review of National Ports Policy will commence later this year which will look at the overall ports policy framework.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s increased ambition in Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) of 5GW of offshore wind by 2030 and  the potential of at least 30GW of floating offshore wind power in our deeper waters in the Atlantic, and, pending the review of overall National Ports Policy in 2022, the Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), conducted an assessment in 2021 of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate the ORE sector and assist in Ireland achieving its emission reduction targets.</p>  <p>  Following the assessment, last December I announced an ORE Ports Policy Statement setting out the strategy for a multi-port approach to the provision of port facilities. As ORE will develop in phases on the east, south, south west and west coast, a multiple of ports will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and at different times for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments.</p>  <p>  This will help maximise the economic benefits at regional as well as national level in terms of the creation of jobs and new SME enterprise that can support the development of the ORE industry. A multiport approach will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade.</p>  <p>  While Irish Ports receive no exchequer funding, EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE is now available for ports, or terminals within ports, on the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T). On its own, CEF funding does not have any State aid implications and successful applicants can obtain significant grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs. </p>  <p>  A call opened on in 2021 for applications and closed last January which makes &euro;4bn funding available EU wide for transport infrastructure projects. Similar calls are expected in 2022 and 2023. These are competitive processes, and typically oversubscribed.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the process, what can be said at this point is that a decision by the European Commission on the applications, which include four Irish applications related to ORE port infrastructure, is due shortly. </p></reply>

This funding to daa provided both Dublin and Cork airports with the flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, which has successfully supported the recovery and growth of connectivity. at both Dublin and Cork airports. </p>  <p>  In relation to redundancies at daa, there were no mandatory redundancies introduced by the daa. The daa did, however, introduce a Voluntary Severance Scheme (VSS) during the summer of 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 crisis as part of the cost-cutting measures deemed necessary to secure the continued financial viability of the company.  </p>  <p>  This was at a time when the daa was losing &euro;1m per day, passenger traffic was substantially reduced, and there was uncertainty around the timing of a recovery with 2019 levels of passengers not envisaged until 2024/2025. </p>  <p>  There was ongoing engagement between the Department of Transport, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and daa over a number of months before the terms and conditions of the VSS were finally approved. While the terms and conditions of the VSS were approved by the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure as required under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State bodies, the number of staff targeted under the VSS was a matter for the daa who have statutory responsibility to operate and manage the airport including ensuring the optimum staffing levels are in place. </p></reply>

No. 415/2017), which sets out the applicable dates for periodic testing, the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date. Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle and any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like all Member States, is obliged to adhere to the specified minimum intervals between roadworthiness inspections. Permitting the validity of roadworthiness certificates to be extended without inspection would place the State in breach of our obligations under European law and may negatively impact road safety should the vehicle in question be unsafe to drive. Consequently, there are currently no plans to amend this legislation.</p></reply>

This year more than &euro;2 billion worth of measures have been put in place.  Of these measures, many were targeted at the rising costs of transport:</p>  <p>  - a cut of 20c for every litre of petrol and 15c for every litre of auto diesel, and a proportionate 2c reduction for excise on green diesel;</p>  <p>  - the temporary enhancement to the Diesel Rebate Scheme, which was provided in Budget 2020, has been maintained;</p>  <p>  - cutting public transport fares by 20% from the end of April;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In respect of the latter two measures, which fall under my remit, the Government approved a 20% fare-reduction initiative on Public Service Obligation (PSO) public transport services, at a cost of &euro;54m.  A Young Adult Card was introduced on both PSO and commercial services in Budget 2022. This measure allows any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. Over 1000 applications received by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, this measure provided &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. On 19 May 2022, the closing date for receipt of completed applications was extended to 6 June 2022. Over &euro;15 million has been paid out under the Scheme to 2,923 licensed operators. Further eligible applications received will be processed over the coming days and final payments will be made shortly.  The Scheme is now closed.  There is ongoing engagement with the haulier industry in terms of their needs.</p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.42 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022, the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  Since early March, with the benefit of the excise reduction, the 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.</p>  <p>  While it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases, I will continue to monitor actively this evolving situation very closely, and consider such further steps as may be necessary in conjunction with my Government colleagues and in consultation with the sector.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. This means that the majority of EV users will never need to access the public network except for longer journeys.</p>  <p>  A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as non-residential neighbourhood charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p>  <p>  A significant increase in funding for public charging points will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.</p>  <p>  The existing Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the deputy that Wicklow County Council have to date not drawn down any funding under the current Public Points Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 kilometres of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in Greenways.</p>  <p>  2021 saw the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland. &euro;72.8m was allocated to 19 local authorities to support the delivery of 340 sustainable transport projects. It should be noted this allocation was more than the entire Active Travel budget for 2019.</p>  <p>  This year has seen another increase in my Department's overall funding for cycling and walking, in line with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of Active Travel and Greenways. As well as an increased allocation of &euro;289 million administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to Active Travel, I was delighted to also announce funding of &euro;60 million for investment in our Greenways.</p>  <p>  The overall increase in funding across urban and rural Ireland will not only support the construction and improvement of safe and connected walking and cycling infrastructure, but also the deployment of almost 250 dedicated Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase safe Active Travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country and equips them with the skills to cycle safely.</p>  <p>  In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme last year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of safe walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. It has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The step-change in funding and the introduction of various innovative measures to encourage safe and connected Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country, including in rural areas. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) are developing a National Cycle Network that will identify routes for development all around the country that will work with the Regional and Local Cycle Networks being developed by the NTA.</p></reply>

Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. </p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. </p>  <p>  In light of subsequent appraisal work that pointed to a very substantial cost if the full route were to be upgraded, the Department engaged with Cavan County Council in relation to carrying out a risk-based analysis for the east-west route between Dundalk and Cavan which involves exploring the possibility of a series of interventions which might improve the safety of the route, improve journey times and bring consistency to the travel speed along the route. The position remains the same as outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 149 in that the report on this analysis is expected shortly.    </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that individual local authorities will examine, taking into account each Council's  overall priorities and available resources, how projects identified in the risk analysis could be brought forward. The Department has allocated some grant funding this year to Cavan County Council and Louth County Council for the initial assessment of two possible schemes subject to the receipt of the required project appraisal documentation from the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  As regards the national road element of an east-west link, I have referred the question to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for a direct reply.

In line with the funding commitments in the National Development Plan and following my request to the NTA, the revised draft strategy does not include proposals for the development of the Limerick Northern Distributor Road.  </p><p>I believe that the rejuvenation, growth and economic development of Limerick is best met through the prioritised delivery of active travel and public transport infrastructure and services, rather than through an over-emphasis on road-based development.  This is central to ensuring that we meet our challenging commitment to deliver a 51% emissions reduction by 2030 and supporting the National Planning Framework (NPF) objective for compact growth.  </p><p>In my view, proceeding with the Limerick Northern Distributor Road would be contrary to the NPF&rsquo;s objective of compact growth, would undermine the investment planned in active travel/public transport and would accentuate and continue a dispersed, unsustainable development model in the region.  I strongly believe that the focus of transport investment for the region in the coming years should be on improving active travel infrastructure, delivering BusConnects, and adopting a more transport-orientated development approach through the expansion of the rail network.  This will allow us to provide a commuter rail system that serves existing and future development. </p><p>I would point out that both the NDP and the revised draft LSMATS do include proposals for road investment in the region where they contribute to overall sustainable transport objectives. </p><p>I look forward to seeing the delivery of much needed transport infrastructure under LSMATS in the coming years to better serve the citizens of the region, improve accessibility and the public realm in a sustainable manner.  </p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.</p><p>Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI). This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and en-route or motorway charging.</p><p>A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly. &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>-  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations and delivery of new, faster and higher capacity technology is awaited to complete this element of the program, due in August and the upgrade program will resume then.  The remaining locations have all been identified and surveyed.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>. </p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p><p>My Department is developing new grant schemes which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations including hotels, car parks and visitor and tourist attractions, both State-owned and commercial sites. This new initiative will  be open for applications from both the public and private sector and help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging. </p><p>As well as the ESB ecars network there are a number of private charge point operators with sites already live in Ireland. Once established, ZEVI will be tasked with developing a single interactive portal for mapping the location and availability of all publicly accessible EV charging points and provide offer a central source of information to EV owners.</p></reply>

During the same period, however, the number of drivers licensed to operate (stand/ply for hire) in Dublin rose by 381 from a total of 14,572 as at 31 December 2021 to a total of 14,953 at end May 2022. </p><p>In terms of licensed vehicles, the total number and breakdown by type of SPSV vehicles licensed in Dublin to end May 2022 has also shown a small increase (of 32) since the beginning of the year as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>County  </th>       <th>Hackney  </th>       <th>Limousine </th>       <th>Local Area Hackney </th>       <th>Taxi </th>       <th>Wheelchair Accessible Hackney </th>       <th>Wheelchair Accessible Taxi </th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin (30 May 2022) </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>430 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>7,833 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1,806 </td>       <td>10,087 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin (31 December 2021) </td>       <td>17 </td>       <td>417 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>7,838 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1,781 </td>       <td>10,055 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Government and the NTA have taken a number of steps to support taxi drivers nationally. Most recently, the NTA proposes an average increase of 12% on taxi fares from 31st August 2022 in the National Maximum Fares Review, which closed for public consultation on May 27th last and which will be the first increase on such fares since 2017.</p><p>Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating (licensing and enforcement) the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework.  Additionally, SPSV operators choose the times at which they operate.</p><p>In this regard, the 2022 driver survey, conducted by the NTA earlier this year, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work the premium rate period, which covers journeys taken between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays and public holidays. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.In recognition of this, the NTA&rsquo;s increased fare proposals have been weighted in favour of the premium rate period. The increase in cents/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers, and it is hoped that this may encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods, and particularly at night-time, to meet the renewed levels of demand that have arisen because of the increase in social activity and the reactivation of the night-time economy.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my Department and the NTA previously introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included several extensions of the maximum vehicle age on an emergency basis, and a temporary licence fee waiver. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licencees will return now that demand for services is increasing.</p><p>The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. I announced this support on 9 June 2021 and an allocation of &euro;2m in funding was provided.  The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.</p><p>The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.</p><p>I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.  The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector, with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible, is available under the Scheme. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. When these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to again apply for the supports on offer. </p><p>At the same time, Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support small business owners with a Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers and are availing of the government&rsquo;s eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.</p></reply>

This 10% target is also included in my Department's recently published <i>Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP)</i>, which aims to reduce demand for private car journeys in general by making it easier for people to travel via more sustainable modes &ndash; be that walking, cycling or public transport.  In tandem with other suitable demand management measures and the electrification of the national passenger fleet, this shift to more sustainable modes will help to deliver on the 10% km reduction target.</p><p>With regard to reduction targets for kilometres driven by electric vehicles (EVs), such targets would not be impactful in terms of decarbonizing the transport sector, given that EVs have zero tailpipe emissions. Rather, incentives aimed at encouraging people to replace their fossil-fueled cars with EVs will help to increase the rate of EV penetration and commensurately reduce the level of emissions in the sector.</p><p>However, as the deputy will also be aware, there are a number of benefits which can be associated with reducing private car ownership and use, regardless of their fuel type, and particularly in urban areas.  These include enhanced livability for residents; increased permeability of the urban space; noise and pollution reduction; reduced traffic congestion; increased road safety; an environment more amenable to active travel choices; and a higher degree of equity among transport users across all modes.</p><p>With that in mind, my Department is undertaking work across several areas aimed at reducing the demand for private car journeys overall.  In December 2021, it published the <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study</i>, which aimed to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city.  The study focused on addressing decarbonization, air quality, congestion and improving the overall urban environment.  A key conclusion of this study is that there is no single solution to tackling the transport demand challenges facing our urban environments.  Rather, utilizing an integrated Travel Demand Management approach to policy development, planning and delivery of our land use and transport systems will be fundamental to addressing these challenges in the coming years.</p><p>In line with our Climate Action Plan commitments, my Department, the NTA, the Regional Assemblies and other bodies are continuing to engage to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025. </p><p>Coupled with the work being carried out under the Sustainable Mobility Policy, these efforts will serve to reduce the number of kilometres driven by passenger cars - firstly by causing people to consider an alternative form of transport, and secondly by making it easier for them to choose more sustainable options such as walking, cycling, or public transport. </p><p>Finally, the preparation of <i>Climate Action Plan 2023</i>will commence shortly and will require engagement among all departments and agencies up to September 2022, before the Climate Action Plan is submitted to Government for approval in November 2022.  It is therefore too early to preempt any changes to targets for the Climate Action Plan 2023, which may otherwise be determined following these engagements.</p></reply>

The research explores a range of issues including educational attainment, educational inequalities in society, skills development and related labour market outcomes, North and South.</p><p>This research adds significantly to the evidence and understanding we have on how our education systems serve students, families and communities on this island, North and South; and how we could cooperate on an all-island basis on education delivery and reform to enhance educational experience and outcomes. </p><p>The ESRI study sets out clearly that, unfortunately, overall education achievement and school completion rates in Northern Ireland lag behind both the rest of the UK and Ireland. This is also the case for the impact of education sector initiatives in recent years to support levels of education completion and attainment in disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Executive has rightly put a focus on addressing this position - last year agreeing to take forward the recommendations of the &lsquo;Fair Start&rsquo; report of the Expert Panel on Educational Underachievement.</p><p>I have long made the case for both the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to do more to support the Executive in this area. The unique community context and legacy in Northern Ireland, means that education reform and meeting the needs of marginalised communities is more complex.</p><p>Tackling educational underachievement is one of the agreed work programme areas as part of Education Sector co-operation through the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>The Government will seek to work with a new Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to enhance our cooperation and support on educational attainment issues in Northern Ireland in the time ahead.</p><p>This is an important part of how we can work together for a more inclusive, prosperous and shared future on this island for all communities.</p><p>The Shared Island unit in my Department, in partnership with the the Standing Conference on Teacher Education, North and South (SCoTENS), has also commissioned two research projects on educational underachievement, which are underway and final reports will be published in October 2022. This work will also contribute to enhanced understanding and professional and policy development on educational attainment, on a shared island basis.</p></reply>

The SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan provides a set of recommendations directly from the business community to the Government of long term strategic importance for SMEs and entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  Balancing our enterprise policy between FDI, export only businesses and indigenous firms, is an important policy consideration and one which was touched upon by the OECD in its 2019 report on entrepreneurship and SME policy in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The OECD report refers to 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland of which 92% are microenterprises. Such a high number presents challenges in terms of the State&rsquo;s engagement and compliance with the EU's state aid rules when engaging with enterprises.</p>  <p>  In terms of provision of business and advisory assistance to indigenous local businesses there is already extensive help available, ranging from information/awareness, advisory, financial schemes, grants for regional enterprise development, delivered through a network of bodies with a wide reach into urban and rural localities, including Enterprise Ireland (EI), the 31 Local Enterprise offices (LEOs), InterTrade Ireland (ITI), and MicroFinance Ireland (MFI). </p>  <p>  My Department administers schemes, such as the Online Retail Scheme, assisting small and medium enterprises trading domestically who were adversely affected by the Covid 19 pandemic to continue trading during the pandemic, work that would not normally come under the Enterprise Ireland remit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is also in a position to assist domestically focussed companies who wish to undertake Research and Development. There have been many non-EI client companies who availed of offers such as the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund and Innovation Vouchers in recent years and there is no barrier to a domestically trading company seeking such R&amp;D support.</p>  <p>  Indeed, Sector specific help is available from a range of other State agencies, such as Skillnet Ireland which works with all sectors, Bord Bia, Teagasc and Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the food, drink and seafood sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in the hospitality and tourism sectors, and the Arts Council, Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council, and Screen Ireland in the creative sector.</p>  <p>  Currently My Department officials are working on an Enterprise White paper which is examining all aspects of Enterprise Policy, including enterprises trading domestically. </p></reply>

My Department does not promote one structure over another and the enterprise supports developed by the Department and its agencies are available to co-operatives, including worker co-operatives, where they meet the criteria for such supports. </p>  <p>  The statutory framework governing co-operatives is in need of comprehensive reform and my Department is finalising a general scheme of a Co-operative Societies Bill. This Bill will consolidate and modernise the existing Industrial and Provident Societies legislation and provide an effective and robust legislative framework for the diverse range of organisations using the co-operative model in Ireland, including worker co-operatives. The Bill will support the co-operative ethos and include new/expanded provisions across a range of areas including registration; corporate governance; compliance; financial reporting; and powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. It will introduce measures to make it easier to set up co-operatives and facilitate their access to finance. This will provide co-operatives with a modern and fit for purpose legislative basis on a par with other legal structures such as companies.  </p>  <p>  It is premature at this stage to speculate on how co-operatives could most appropriately be supported into the future and if establishing a development unit catering for the needs of worker co-operatives would be necessary. In the context of enactment of the Co-operative Societies Bill, my Department intends to engage widely with stakeholders including the co-operative sector, professional advisers, development agencies, relevant Government departments etc. to raise awareness of the modernised legislative basis that will underpin co-operatives and provide an attractive alternative for entities wishing to operate under the co-operative ethos.</p></reply>

This research was to consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could achieve it.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission submitted its Living Wage Report to me on 31 March 2022, along with the accompanying research report from Maynooth University. I plan to publish the LPC report and recommendations today and will initiate a public consultation. Following the public consultation, a specific proposal will be brought to Government in the autumn on progressing to a statutory living wage. The implications for the public sector pay bill will be addressed in the context of that specific proposal.  </p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July. </p></reply>

It contains 33 actions which will give our towns the tools and resources they need to become more viable and attractive places in which to live, work, socialise and run a business.</p>  <p>  The policy recognises that the needs of each town are different and acknowledges that a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach will not deliver the outcomes wanted. The policy sets out a framework to facilitate and resource each town to chart their own future through a tailored plan, developed by a collaborative Town Team, and supported by their Local Authority.</p>  <p>  It is underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), Cro&iacute; Conaithe (Towns) Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>  <p>  The policy will assist each town, through a Town Team supported by the Local Authority, to design, develop and implement a plan to make their towns more vibrant and attractive places to live and work. This could include the development of accessible and safe public spaces in the respective towns. The regeneration of our public spaces is identified as a key opportunity in the Town Centre First Policy.</p>  <p>  A National Town Centre First Office will drive the delivery of many of the recommendations outlined in the policy and support the co-ordinated roll-out of the policy by local authorities, Town Regeneration Officers, and Town Teams.  </p>  <p>  Departments for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and for Rural and Community Development have agreed the structure and funding for the National Implementation Office and the Town Regeneration Officers with local authorities.

This will be the first Monday in every February, except where St. Brigid&rsquo;s day, the 1st day of February, happens to fall on a Friday, in which case that Friday 1st February will be a public holiday. The Government wants to ensure that the public holiday provides for a long weekend. The first St. Brigid&rsquo;s day public holiday will be Monday 6th February 2023.</p><p>This will raise the public holidays in Ireland to 10, bringing us more into line with other member states where the numbers range from 8 to 15 days. While there are costs involved, there is no compensation for employers for any public holidays. However, there are many benefits to the economy, as an additional public holiday helps to stimulate spending throughout the country, particularly in businesses operating in the tourism, entertainment, recreation, and hospitality sectors.</p><p>Due to lack of data, it is not possible to generate a historical estimate for the impact of a one-off public holiday using Irish data. Previous analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics estimated the economic impact of an additional one-off public holiday would reduce annual gross national income by between 0.3% and 0.4%. The Department of Finance projects Modified Gross National Income of &euro;242 billion in 2022. Based on the above data, the cost of introducing a new public holiday would be in the region of &euro;0.7 billion to &euro;1 billion. This estimate is of limited value however given the range of variables.</p><p>In terms of costs to employers, in practice not all sectors will be equally impacted by a bank holiday &ndash; for example, the accommodation and food services sector may experience a rise in activity during a bank holiday, similarly a selection of retailers may choose to continue to operate during a bank holiday. As well as the economic cost of an additional public holiday, there are also positive aspects including benefits of leisure from an additional day off for many, as well as any further community and societal benefits.</p></reply>

However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.</p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, and a total of 17,968 applications processed, which represents a significant volume of activity. </p>  <p>  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I recognise the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has for businesses and their workers.  An internal plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system. The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from about 11,000 in January 2022 to c. 6,000 today, despite further strong growth in demand in 2022.  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills and Intra Corporate Transfer Employment Permits, processing times for those permits have fallen from 21 weeks to 5 weeks.  The Department aims to maintain processing times for these permit types at under 6 weeks for all of Q2.  </p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit has recently completed processing 3,000 additional General Employment Permits applications made available to the meat and horticultural sectors, following the last review of the Occupational Lists, in addition to normal processing workload. </p>  <p>  Within the last month processing times for General Employment Permit applications for Trusted Partners fell from 22 weeks to 14 weeks, while applications from Standard applicants fell from 22 weeks to 17 weeks.  These should continue to fall, with processing times considerably reduced by the end of Quarter 2.  </p>  <p>  The administration and processing of immigration permissions, including visas, is a separate system with a different legislative framework encompassing rules and requirements to the employment permits regime and is the policy responsibility of the Department of Justice.  </p>  <p>  My officials liaise regularly with their Department of Justice colleagues to deliver changes to improve the efficiency of both systems.</p></reply>

Many companies own other companies and section 357 recognises the principle that consolidated financial statements should present the activities of a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity (a group).</p>  <p>  By establishing these rules at EU level and harmonising national law governing consolidated financial statements there is comparability and equivalence in the information which parent companies should publish across the EU.</p>  <p>  Section 357 also sets out certain conditions that must be complied with in order to avail of this exemption and these include that a copy of the guarantee and notification to shareholders must be annexed to the subsidiary annual return to the Registrar. The parent company consolidated financial statements and audit report must also be included in the return.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Companies has no general power under the Companies Act 2014 to administratively amend the CRO register or to allow amendments to be made to registered documents. Neither does the Registrar have a statutory power to remove registered submissions from the register. </p></reply>

In 2009, ComReg appointed .ie Domain Registry (IEDR) as the Authority authorised to register .ie domain names.  The IEDR has a policy on registration and naming, setting out the requirements for new registrants, which includes that they must provide evidence of their real and substantive connection to the island of Ireland. The registration of .ie domains does not require .ie websites to be based in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is very aware of the changes that consumers have faced as a result of the UK leaving the EU. The CCPC has developed advice for both consumers and businesses, available on its website, to support trading and shopping online in the post-Brexit environment where businesses based in the UK must navigate additional customs and VAT requirements when supplying to consumers based in the EU.  Advice issued to consumers by the CCPC includes the following:-</p>  <p>  - Check where the business is based before buying online.</p>  <p>  - Check the business&rsquo;s registered address in the terms and conditions section of the website to find out where they are registered.  A site that has a &lsquo;.ie&rsquo; or &rsquo;.eu&rsquo; domain is not always a sign of where a business is registered or based.</p>  <p>  - If a business has more than one website with a number of different domains &ndash; e.g. &lsquo;.de&rsquo; or &lsquo;.co.uk&rsquo;, check the registered address on each website before buying from it. </p>  <p>  The CCPC advises that buying from an EU-based business provides strong consumer protections, which ensure that the consumer has enough, clear information and is not misled before making a purchase. It also ensures that the consumer has rights if something does go wrong &ndash; particularly the right to a refund. Buying from a non-EU website means that EU consumer rights do not automatically apply and therefore, if something does go wrong, it may be more difficult to get the issue resolved.</p></reply>

The review process incorporates a public consultation, providing an opportunity for stakeholders to submit information and perspectives on the nature and extent of skills or labour shortages. Stakeholder submissions are a vital source of information and views, helping inform the Department&rsquo;s final assessment of the status of occupations. </p>  <p>  Account is also taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors, such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and the Ukrainian humanitarian Crisis, and their impact on the labour market. </p>  <p>  In order to have an occupation considered for adding or removing from the Occupations Lists, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions. Stakeholders need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims and are also required to engage structurally with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Submissions to the review are considered by the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy with membership drawn from senior officials of key Government Departments, who may provide their observations on the occupation under consideration. As the Department of Agriculture is the relevant policy department for the agricultural sector, support to a request such as adding agricultural skills to the Critical Skills Occupations List would be sought from that Department in the first instance.</p></reply>

We have already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers in the supply chain.</p><p>Minister Donohoe recently announced the extension of the 9% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for a further six months; a measure for which &euro;250 million is the estimated cost to the exchequer . </p><p>Furthermore, the Government has recently launched its &lsquo;Reduce Your Use&rsquo; public information campaign. This highlights the range of supports that are available to households and businesses ranging from practical advice to financial supports. </p><p>Businesses can view these on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Energy-supports/Energy-supports-for-business.html</i>. </p><p>Practical advice includes the Climate Toolkit 4 Business, launched late last year by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. This allows SMEs to input simple information to get an estimate of their carbon footprint and a personalised action plan to reduce it.</p><p>From the Local Enterprise Offices, the Green for Micro initiative offers mentoring to micro-enterprises looking to become greener. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits. Further training is available via the SEAI&rsquo;s Energy Academy.</p><p>Finally, there are loans available for businesses absorbing the numerous economic shocks of recent years. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland offers the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, offering loans from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for businesses responding to the impact of COVID-19. These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs. </p><p>Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25k from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.</p><p>Additionally, the Lean for Micro scheme works with LEO clients to help build resilience.</p><p>Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.</p><p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th April 2022.</p></reply>

Retail, like all businesses must adapt to the drive for digitalisation. </p><p>The Online Retail Scheme, introduced by my Department was established to assist companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to enhance and strengthen their existing online presence. The Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, provides direct financial support to retail companies with more than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online business offering to complement their in-store offering. </p><p>A new Call of the Online Retail Scheme, with a total available fund of &euro;9.3m, was announced on 5<sup>th</sup>May and closed at midday on 1<sup>st</sup>June.  </p><p>In 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to increase their online capability.  Under the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme &euro;18.2m in funding was provided to over 500 retailers from all across the country in the categories of  jewellery, fashion, sports, homeware, furniture, healthcare, hardware, electrical goods and equipment.</p><p>Prior to the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme, 40 retailers across Ireland were provided &euro;894,634 in funding over two calls of the pilot Online Retail Scheme. The pilot Online Scheme was introduced to enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business.</p><p>The Online Retail Scheme is complementary to the &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher scheme, provided through the Local Enterprise Offices for companies with up to 10 employees.  While this scheme is not solely for the retail sector it assists retailers to begin their online trading journey.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVs) administered by the Local Enterprise Offices offers a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 (50% co- funded by the applicant) to help businesses develop their online trading capability and includes training sessions that cover various topics, including developing a website, digital marketing, social media for business and search engine optimisation. The Scheme is open to a broad base of businesses with fewer than 10 employees.</p><p>From the 1<sup>st</sup>of January to the 9<sup>th</sup>of June 2022, the LEOs have approved 801 Trading Online Vouchers, to a value of &euro;1,680,641.27.</p><p>The retail sector, like all other sectors is challenged to adapt to climate transition. </p><p>The Green For Micro scheme run by the Local Enterprise Offices is assisting small businesses in gaining an increased understanding of actions which can improve their energy efficiency through the Green for Micro programme.  It offers green transition advice and technical support to a wide range of micro-enterprises with 10 or fewer employees, including those operating in the retail sector. This support is free of charge for eligible enterprises and represents the potential for increased efficiencies within companies that adopt these principles.</p><p>The full range of supports offered by my Department and across Government for businesses, including retailers, can be found on Which support is for you? - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p><p>The Government will continue to address the needs of the sector and engage with retailers through the Retail Forum, which I chair as Minister of State for Employment, Business and Retail. </p></reply>

Protecting the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) and the hard-won gains of the peace process is our primary concern, which the Protocol does in all its dimensions. It was designed and mutually agreed by the UK and EU to safeguard the GFA, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, protecting North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and ensuring &lsquo;no diminution of rights, safeguards, or equality of opportunity&rsquo; as set out in the GFA. </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office compiles statistical data in relation to Goods Exports and Imports. These statistics can be found on the website www.cso.ie   </p>  <p>  According to the CSO, in 2020, our total Goods Exports were valued at &euro;162bn.  Goods Exports to the UK were valued at &euro;14.7bn (of which &euro;12.3bn was exported to Great Britain and &euro;2.4bn to Northern Ireland).  Our total Services Exports in 2020 were valued at &euro;244bn while Services Exports to the UK were valued at &euro;35bn. </p>  <p>  In 2020, our total Goods Imports were valued at &euro;87bn. Goods Imports from the UK were valued at &euro;20.1bn (of which &euro;17.7bn was imported from Great Britain and &euro;2.4bn from Northern Ireland). Our total Services Imports in 2020 were valued at &euro;306bn while Services Imports from the UK were valued at &euro;20bn. </p>  <p>  In 2021, our total Goods Exports were valued at &euro;165bn.  Goods Exports to the UK were valued at &euro;18.1bn (of which &euro;14.4bn was exported to Great Britain and &euro;3.7bn to Northern Ireland). Services data for 2021 is not yet disaggregated at individual country level. </p>  <p>  In 2021, our total Goods Imports were valued at &euro;103bn.  Goods Imports from the UK in 2021 were valued at &euro;19.3bn (of which &euro;15.3bn was imported from Great Britain and &euro;4bn from Northern Ireland). </p>  <p>  We continue to closely monitor the impact Brexit and COVID-19 are having on imports and exports to Great Britain and the wider EU.  The further introduction of checks and controls for trade to Great Britain can be expected to have an impact in due course on our exports. </p>  <p>  We will continue to help companies diversify and discover new markets and reap the benefits of free trade agreements and work with them to adapt to new realities, both in relation to Brexit and to COVID-19.</p></reply>

The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where it is evidenced that there is more than sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular, evidence-based review guided by relevant research, a public/stakeholder consultation, the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health. Account is also taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors, such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and the Ukrainian humanitarian Crisis, and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  While submissions from the home care sector were considered, the most recently concluded review announced towards the end of last year did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/homecarers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggested that the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage.  </p>  <p>  Department officials are actively engaged with the Department of Health in relation to recruitment challenges and my Department is a member of the Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group chaired by the Department of Health.  Areas being considered by the Group include recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions, and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future.  The Group provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address these workforce challenges in the sector and will develop a set of recommendations for the Minister of Health's consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations by September 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to review the employment permits system in light of changing labour market circumstances.  Submissions will be invited from sector representative bodies and interested parties via the Public Consultation Form which will be accessible on the Department&rsquo;s website throughout the consultation period when the next Review of the Occupational Lists commences. </p></reply>

In my  capacity as Minister of State for Trade Promotion I have undertaken a number of visits this year. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government's 2022 St Patrick's Day programme of Ministerial visits abroad to promote Ireland and Irish interests around the world, I travelled to India. While in India, I met with my counterparts in the Indian Government to discuss strengthening trade relations.  I also met with key business leaders and education institutions to support the growing economic and educational links between Ireland and India, and to explore opportunities for further collaboration. I also launched the Indian branch of the Ireland-India Business Association and opened Ireland House in Mumbai, both of which marked a significant new chapter in Ireland&rsquo;s economic relationship with India.</p>  <p>  In April, I led an Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission to Lisbon in which ten EI client companies from a range of sectors participated. While in Portugal, I spoke at a number of Enterprise Ireland trade events and met with participating Enterprise Ireland client companies to learn about their export objectives. </p>  <p>  In May, I led a joint EI/IDA trade mission to Georgia, South Carolina, Monterrey and Mexico in which 26 Irish companies participated. I met with senior executives from across the talent technology, fintech, advanced manufacturing and digital technology sectors. I also met with Mexican officials and counterparts.</p>  <p>  Also in May, I led a two day trade mission to Spain which was focussed on the experience and expertise that Irish construction companies have earned in the high-tech construction sub-sector. </p>  <p>  This month I am leading a four-day trade mission to Germany, France and the Netherlands, jointly organised by the Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The four-day trade mission, visiting Frankfurt, Paris, the Hague and Amsterdam will have a strong focus on the technology industry, both presenting FDI opportunities, and promoting Irish innovation and collaboration between Irish companies and companies in Germany, France and the Netherlands.</p></reply>

This draft Decision offers the most promising path towards achieving a meaningful outcome that will contribute to ensuring access to safe and effective vaccines across the globe. </p><p>The draft Decision provides for a waiver and clarification of some of the flexibilities within the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.  If agreed, the proposal will address the concerns of South Africa and developing countries and will allow them to immediately authorise the manufacture, import and export of COVID-19 vaccines without the consent of the patent owners.  At the same time, the solution maintains a functioning intellectual property framework which is crucial to incentivise investment and research that is necessary for the development of new vaccines and medicines.</p><p>As a member of the EU, Ireland has been fully engaged in the overall EU response in relation to the intellectual property aspects of the trade related response to the pandemic and will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the discussions at the Ministerial Conference.</p></reply>

As a small open economy, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this. In that context, I believe that ratifying the agreement would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.</p><p>The Agreement has provisionally applied since 21st September 2017, meaning a great many of the benefits are already in place. Since provisional application, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed and goods exports to Canada have increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 36%, while services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 38 per cent. These figures demonstrate the positive impact of CETA.</p><p>At the Joint Oireachtas Committee last year, I highlighted the benefits of CETA. I also said that, while I welcome the scrutiny at Committee, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have. That would send out the wrong message to the world.</p><p>The ratification process for CETA has also been subject to legal challenges. In March last year, Deputy Patrick Costello commenced High Court proceedings on the basis of his view that CETA requires a referendum in order to be ratified in Ireland. The Government very much welcomed the Judgement in those High Court proceedings that issued last September, which rejected Deputy Costello&rsquo;s challenge to the Government&rsquo;s proposed ratification of CETA.</p><p>Deputy Costello has subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court and judgement is currently awaited. Separately, Senator Lynn Boylan has initiated a High Court action on ratification but a hearing date has not yet been set in this matter.</p><p>It remains the position that Government will consider the next steps in Ireland&rsquo;s ratification process once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgement.</p></reply>

Section 63 provides that a trader who contravenes an order made under section 62 commits an offence.  These provisions have not been availed of since their enactment.</p>  <p>  In general, there are no ceilings set for prices in Ireland and, with one exception (minimum unit pricing for alcohol), there is no legislation explicitly stating what the maximum or the minimum price for any product or service should be.  Such an approach aims to promote competition amongst retailers and service providers.  </p>  <p>  Some prices, especially for services/utilities, are regulated, whereby the service provider or retailer must apply to the industry regulator for approval for any price increase.  For example, suppliers of electricity, telecommunications and postal services may not charge more than the approved prices.  Suppliers of financial services do not apply for approval for price changes but must inform the Central Bank of Ireland about any such changes.</p>  <p>  Price controls are a blunt instrument and could have serious economic impacts for individual traders and Ireland as a whole.  For goods or services that are imported or where domestic production has a high import content, the effect would be reduced supply.  In other cases, the risk lies in the medium-term effects on competition in the marketplace and supply chains.  </p>  <p>  Invoking these specific provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 would require a decision by Government and it is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to do so as it has already introduced a number of measures to address the increase in the cost of living and will examine any further measures deemed necessary in the context of the Budget in October.  </p></reply>

This draft Decision offers the most promising path towards achieving a meaningful outcome that will contribute to ensuring access to safe and effective vaccines across the globe. </p><p>At the Conference, I made it clear that I think the time has come to agree a deal on the TRIPS waiver and urged members to support the proposition. This is an EU competence but we support any proposal that results in more vaccines being produced and distributed while protecting research and innovation.</p><p>The draft Decision provides for a waiver and clarification of some of the flexibilities within the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.  If agreed, the proposal will address the concerns of South Africa and developing countries and will allow them to immediately authorise the manufacture, import and export of COVID-19 vaccines without the consent of the patent owners.  At the same time, the solution maintains a functioning intellectual property framework which is crucial to incentivise investment and research that is necessary for the development of new vaccines and medicines.</p><p>As a member of the EU, Ireland has been fully engaged in the overall EU response in relation to the intellectual property aspects of the trade related response to the pandemic and will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the discussions at the Ministerial Conference.</p></reply>

Eligibility for the Scheme is linked to receipt of certain Department of Social Protection payments. Since 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.</p><p>A budget allocation of &euro;109 million has been provided for the scheme this year. This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades, from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the scheme were selected as they represented the Department&rsquo;s view on those areas where the resources available to the scheme could have the greatest impact. They are kept under ongoing review with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department. </p><p>In line with commitments in the National Retrofit Plan to improve the targeting of free energy efficiency upgrades, a number of changes to the scheme were announced in February this year. One of these changes was to extend the scheme eligibility criteria to include those in receipt of the Disability Allowance for over 6 months and have a child under 7 years. This change brings the eligibility criteria for the scheme for those in receipt of Disability Allowance in line with the existing criteria for the scheme for those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance. Young children are at particular risk of long-term impacts from living in a cold home. </p><p>I understand that the Blind Pension is a qualifying payment for the Fuel Allowance, which is a means tested payment. Households can contact the Department of Social Protection to check whether they meet the relevant means test.</p><p>All information on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme is available on the SEAI website at  </p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal of generating up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Formal procurement of international experts in electricity grid infrastructure was completed last September. The international experts are continuing their work on the report, which has taken longer than expected, but I hope to receive it shortly.  </p></reply>

The Plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance. In line with commitments in the Plan, the Government earlier this year in February approved a package of significantly enhanced supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades.   Since the announcement in February, all SEAI&rsquo;s grant schemes have seen increased interest with the application rate nearly double the rate of last year. This now stands at nearly 18,300 grant applications across the Better Energy Homes Scheme; Warmer Homes Scheme; and the Solar PV Scheme.</p></reply>

As part of the achievement of this reduction the CAP set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by end-2030.  This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide.   Recognising that the achievement of these targets will require a step-change in the pace and scale of delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme, the Government has approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills. </p>  <p>  To support the overarching policy objectives, the grants available to homeowners are focused towards those measures which will be most effective in reducing energy use, reducing carbon emissions and reaching the targets set out in the Programme for Government and Climate Action Plan. Heat pumps are extremely efficient and very economical to run offering lower energy costs to homeowners as well as reduced carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  The SEAI published the National Heat Study on 22 February 2022. The study considered a number of potential decarbonisation options for a wide range of dwelling and business types. This included the use of liquid biofuels, solid biomass, biogases and other technologies such as heat pumps and district heating networks.  The Study, which was prepared at my Department&rsquo;s request, contains detailed analysis which will now facilitate the development of options, policies and measures to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors to 2050.</p></reply>

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act also ensures delivery of successive Climate Action Plans, as well as National Long-term Climate Action Strategies, and National Adaptation Frameworks,To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November. The 2021 Plan identifies the actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets for each sector of the economy, based on their respective starting points, and the relative challenges and benefits, of reducing emissions. In the coming months my Department will engage proactively with the public, key stakeholders, and other Government Departments to prepare this year&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, which I expect to publish before the end of the year. It is envisaged that this will be the first statutory plan under the 2021 Act, fully reflecting the sectoral emission ceilings which the Government intends to adopt shortly.</p><p>In terms of public engagement, there will be a particular focus on engaging with those who may be vulnerable to the transition to carbon neutral society, and those who have not yet engaged in climate discourses. This will be achieved this through an online public consultation, focus groups with specific populations, workshops with Public Participation Networks, and a range of stakeholder interviews. My Department is in the final stages of planning this detailed programme of engagement activities and expect to launch the consultation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

A consultation paper on policy options for private wires was due to be published in Q1 of this year. Unfortunately, this work is currently delayed, and a date has not yet been set for when this consultation will issue. However, I appreciate that private wires/direct lines are an issue that is of interest and importance to many stakeholders. Publishing a consultation and, ultimately, providing a clear policy position on the issue of private networks/direct lines is a priority for the Department. </p><p>The specific role that direct line renewables could play in helping to meet the projected increase in electricity demand from data centres in Ireland will ultimately depend on the outcome of this review. However, Government is already taking a number of steps to help address these challenges. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently reviewing the 2018 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' to align with our renewable energy targets, sectoral emission ceilings and security of supply. This is part of a suite of actions included in the Climate Action Plan 2021 to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions, while facilitating growth in digitalisation and our technology sector.

Over 67,800 premises can order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 60,400 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. Almost 13,000 premises are connected. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with projections with some areas exceeding expectations. NBI has advised that, as of the end of May, over 8,800 premises in County Cork are passed with a highspeed fibre broadband network and available for immediate connection.  </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 June 2022, 617 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 24 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.  The site at Ionadh &Aacute;ise, Renaniree, Cork, which is now connected with high speed broadband, is located approximately 5.4km from the premises referred to in the Question. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p><p>In County Cork 50 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>. </p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the impact that current, internationally influenced, energy price increases are having on people and families. For that reason, Government has put in place a series of measures to help alleviate the impact, particularly on lower income households.   In cases where apartment blocks or groups of buildings are supplied with heat, rather than fuel, commercial rates apply, as the energy service operator is purchasing the fuel at a large scale. However, under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, 2011, Owners&rsquo; Management Companies are precluded from entering contracts of duration greater than three years, and this provides a possibility to renegotiate energy supplier contracts.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Renewable Energy Directive includes, inter alia, provisions concerning use of unavoidable waste heat when planning district heating and provisions requiring Member States to facilitate the development of heating and cooling derived from renewable sources. District heating, within a structured framework, is a technology that: offers the potential to diversify fuel supply used to heat the building sector; can offer flexibility in fuel choice; and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscape. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions that will provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a multi-disciplinary District Heating Steering Group. The District Heating Steering Group, which is up and running and has met four times already this year, is working on recommendations to ensure that there is a robust governance and regulatory framework in place along with any legislation that may be required, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive. Considerations in this regard will also encompass pre-existing district heating and local heating schemes that are already in operation in Ireland.</p></reply>

Key to any response would be the implementing of contingency plans, including as the primary response tool, the release to the market of oil stocks managed by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) from the State&rsquo;s strategic oil reserve and the communication to the general public of the need to reduce their usage of petroleum products by eliminating unnecessary journey's and eco-driving etc.  In the unlikely event of a prolonged and severe shortage it may be necessary to prioritise the supply of product to the emergency and crucial services. Such contingency planning is kept under review and has recently been updated in the context of the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On May 26th my Department, as part of ongoing oil contingency planning, chaired a desktop oil emergency exercise in the NECC.  The exercise was attended by key Government Departments, Agencies and key oil industry participants with a range of expertise, including in shipping, logistics and retailing. The exercise included the modelling of significant oil shortages in domestic supply chains.</p>  <p>  While significant and prolonged oil emergencies are considered unlikely, oil emergency exercises are conducted periodically by the Department.  Such exercises are considered a valuable tool in ensuring the State is prepared to respond effectively to any significant supply disruption.  In particular, NORA ensures that it remains ready to release product onto the market at short notice, if required.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be pleased to note however that the oil industry have expressed confidence to the Department about the reliability of oil supplies going forward.</p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and was jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2016, almost 1,500 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed.    Given that the research element of the scheme has now closed to participants having reached a sufficient number, new applications for the scheme ceased on 28 February. Existing applicants are receiving their upgrades in line with the existing terms and conditions. </p>  <p>  The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) were engaged in April 2017 to carry out, in collaboration with the HSE, an independent analysis of the health impacts of improved energy efficiency among the participants in the research element of this scheme. The LSHTM has been working closely with the research committee for the project, which consists of officials from my Department, the HSE, the Department of Health and the SEAI since then. An interim report including preliminary results was submitted to my Department in December 2021 and the final results and draft final report are due in the coming weeks. The value of the contract is &euro;162,378.41 and to date the LSHTM have received payment of &euro;107,812.80 excluding VAT.</p>  <p>  Delays in completing this work have been due to various unavoidable issues including data protection in light of the introduction of the GDPR, Brexit &ndash; as the researcher is based in the UK, and the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that some HSE staff were unable to work on the data collection and management for this project for a period of time.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer investment in this scheme has significantly improved the warmth and comfort of the homes involved. The interim report has indicated that the upgrades are also delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants. Participants have also reported needing fewer GP and hospital visits, fewer prescriptions for antibiotics as well as increased engagement with other support services in the community. </p>  <p>  The learnings from the scheme have already influenced the development of policy for other SEAI schemes, in particular in relation to improving the customer journey and working with vulnerable homeowners. The details of how the scheme can further inform Government&rsquo;s approaches to retrofitting, especially with regard to those who are more vulnerable and at risk of energy poverty, will be considered when the final findings of the analysis are available. </p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to a feasibility study for free public transport in Ireland, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This includes securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and the development of the Leap Card. The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including the Rural Transport Programme management, which operates under the TFI Local Link brand.  </p>  <p>  In line with the whole of Government approach, my Department and the NTA have been working on practical and meaningful responses to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  From the beginning of the crisis, we have provided newly arriving Ukrainians with free travel from their port of entry to their end destination on any PSO or Local Link service. Indeed, many commercial bus services similarly offered this assistance in getting people to a safe location.  </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to announce the provision of emergency public transport services to those refugees housed in rural or isolated locations to ensure better access to our local communities. This will be achieved through an acceleration of network improvements identified through the Connecting Ireland public consultation, including additional stops, route modifications, and more services with the aim of increasing connectivity. Rural areas will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for both existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis. Additional bus services will also be deployed to cater for those housed away from the existing public transport network. Such measures will provide better access to a range of amenities, employment opportunities and to onward public transport connections to larger centres.</p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to advise the Deputy that the Free Travel Scheme is a non-statutory scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection, which is available to persons aged 66 years or over who are permanently resident in the State, and to all carers in receipt of Carers' Allowance.  The Scheme is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Any extension of this scheme would therefore be a matter for the Department of Social Protection to consider.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, including night-time bus services.</p><p>In addition, the regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the<i>Taxi Regulation Act 2013. </i></p><p>The Government and the NTA have recently taken a number of steps to support taxi drivers who are already in the industry. </p><p>The draft Maximum Fares Order 2022, which was open for public consultation until May 27th, included a proposed average increase in taxi fares of 12.5%.  By facilitating this increase in maximum fares, the NTA is addressing the pressures that the taxi industry clearly faces, particularly the rising cost of fuel. This is designed in such a way as to provide a larger increase for premium hours (20.00 to 08.00, Sundays and Bank Holidays) and shorter journeys. This is the period, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, when there are the most complaints about the unavailability of taxis. It is hoped that increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare, will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, as well as making the sector more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.</p><p>The 2022 driver survey, undertaken by the NTA, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work this period. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.In recognition of this, the proposed fare has been weighted in favour of the Premium Rate period.  The increase in cents/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers and it is hoped that this will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers to reactivate their licences.</p><p>My Department and the NTA introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included an increase in the maximum vehicle age, and licence fees at no cost. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing.</p><p>The SPSV Motor Tax Refund Scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. and I provided &euro;2m in funding for this Scheme. The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 following NTA&rsquo;s extensive efforts to put in place the necessary process to ensure SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022. </p><p>The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.</p><p>My Department has made available funding to the NTA to provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to being wheelchair accessible which is a requirement for new entrants to the SPSV industry.  The uptake of the Wheelchair Accessible Taxi (WAT) grant scheme has been strong, with 3,341 grants allocated for the purchase of a WAT between 2014 and 2021, with associated funding of over &euro;3 million given over that period.</p><p>I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.  The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. Once these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to again apply for the supports on offer. </p><p>In light of the Authority's responsibility in these areas, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the availability of public transport and public service vehicles after 11pm in Dublin, to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days.</p><p>The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle (EV) charging network over the coming years. A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.</p><p>Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p> <blockquote> 	- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.<br /><br />- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations and delivery of new, faster and higher capacity technology is awaited to complete this element of the program, due in August and the upgrade program will resume then.  The remaining locations have all been identified and surveyed.<br /><br />- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced. </blockquote>  <p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>.</p></reply>

The ten-year rule was recommended by the 2011 Taxi Regulation Review and came about following a public consultation on vehicle standards for taxis, hackneys, and limousines held that year. It was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully, cogniscant of the fact that the replacement of a vehicle is a SPSV operator's single largest cost. There is no consideration being given to amending these age-related rules now, or at any time in the future.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.  The aim of the electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme is to support the greening of the taxi sector. It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. Once these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will re-open for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to apply once again for the supports on offer. </p></reply>

In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. The Government allocated &euro;54m in Exchequer funding to provide this measure; however, this funding does not currently include an extension of the scheme to commercial operators.</p><p>In recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p><p>The discount has initially been made available on all subsidised PSO bus, rail and Luas services. It will then be broadened to include commercial operators as soon as practical. Intensive work is underway with representatives from the commercial bus sector, the NTA and the Department to devise a mechanism to implement and expedite the deployment of the Young Adult Card in the commercial bus sector.</p><p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. In acknowledgement of the continuing difficulties facing the sector, these supports have been extended up to 30 June 2022 and to date, over &euro;64 million has been provided to support the commercial bus operators through these supports alone.</p><p>It is clear that the above fare initiatives will be of great benefit to public transport users and will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with the associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles. </p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support SPSVs to switch to electric.</p>  <p>  The scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to new applicants to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers which usually have a time limit of three months.

Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, or HVO, is a form of renewable diesel that can be used as a replacement fuel for fossil diesel. It is a drop-in fuel and, unlike conventional biodiesel, it can be blended at higher rates and is not limited to a 7% blend.</p>  <p>  The biofuel obligation has been in place since 2010 and, since that time, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel supply through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers. The obligation ensures that a certain percentage (currently 13% by volume) of the motor fuel placed on the market comes from renewable sources, for example bioethanol and biodiesel. In 2020 alone, 239 million litres of biofuels replaced about 209 million litres of fossil fuels, avoiding approximately 520 KtCO2eq. GHG emissions. </p>  <p>  Biofuels will remain a core transitional measure for medium-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in road transport. This is particularly so for hard to abate sectors such as heavy-duty vehicles, where alternative transport energy and technology are at early and varying stages of development. However,  concerns exist regarding the source, production, traceability and sustainability of the feedstocks for biofuels. My Department is currently carrying out a study on the sustainability and availability of bio- and renewable fuels supply and demand in transport. This study will help to inform the development of the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy over the coming years, with due regard to the ambitious domestic targets for renewable fuels in the Climate Action Plan and proposed future European obligations for renewable fuels.</p>  <p>  I published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement in November 2021. The Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to address Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive. It supports the actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and increase the share of renewable fuels in the national Climate Action Plan 2021 and our international obligations, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The Policy proposes measures to achieve higher rates of biofuel blending in transport fuel supply annually to achieve the Climate Action Plan target of 10% bioethanol in petrol and 20% biodiesel in diesel by 2030.</p>  <p>   In addition, the Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy aims to will further incentivise the supply of advanced renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen, and it reiterates the commitment to the highest standards of sustainability of biofuel supply from source. It is Government and EU policy to support the deployment of alternative fuels. This is reflected in the introduction of the Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle grant in March 2021, the Budget 2022 announcement of the expansion of the Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment to include hydrogen vehicles and equipment, the roll-out of the CNG fuelling network and the provision of policy advice for projects looking at the development of green hydrogen projects. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Alternatively Fuels Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant scheme supports the purchase of new large vans, trucks, buses and coaches. The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains that offer environmental benefits over standard diesel vehicle technologies, and that would not otherwise have been bought. </p>  <p>  To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the company or enterprise applying for the grant, and on the fuel-type of the vehicle that the applicant wishes to buy. </p>  <p>  &euro;3m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, a further &euro;3m was allocated this year.</p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 58,000 at the end of April.</p><p>In addition, the Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target.

Work is ongoing to identify additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil-fuelled vehicles. Overall, cost-effective, targeted policy supports will continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years</p><p>- Work is under way to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI), as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  </p><p>A cross-departmental Implementation Committee has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the EVPP report and is due to report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.</p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review in an effort to make low-emission vehicles affordable.</p><p>The draft Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy, which was published for public consultation at the end of March, concurrently sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand for EVs as we move towards our 2030 targets.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, and which has been provided to the Department of Transport by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Central Statistics Office, is in the following tables:</p><p>Vehicles registered for the first time in Ireland by fuel type <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022 to the end of May</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BEV</td>       <td>9,508</td>       <td>8,069</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PHEV</td>       <td>7,890</td>       <td>4,754</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total EVs</td>       <td>17,398</td>       <td>12,823</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>EV grants paid in 2021</p><p>Number <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>BEV</th>       <th>BEV</th>       <th>PHEV</th>       <th>PHEV</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Number</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>       <td>Number</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commercial</td>       <td>205</td>       <td>776,600</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>22,800</td>       <td>211</td>       <td>799,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Demo</td>       <td>998</td>       <td>3,770,000</td>       <td>1,183</td>       <td>4,373,600</td>       <td>2,181</td>       <td>8,143,600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private</td>       <td>5,355</td>       <td>26,705,800</td>       <td>5,668</td>       <td>27,464,500</td>       <td>11,023</td>       <td>54,170,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>6,558</td>       <td>31,252,400</td>       <td>6,857</td>       <td>31,860,900</td>       <td>13,415</td>       <td>63,113,300</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>EV grants paid in 2022 to the end of May <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>BEV</th>       <th>BEV</th>       <th>PHEV</th>       <th>PHEV</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Number</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>       <td>Number</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>       <td>Number</td>       <td>Grant (&euro;)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commercial</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>280,400</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>22,800</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>280,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Demo</td>       <td>326</td>       <td>1,232,400</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>250,100</td>       <td>394</td>       <td>1,482,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private</td>       <td>4,781</td>       <td>23,858,000</td>       <td>178</td>       <td>718,000</td>       <td>4,959</td>       <td>24,576,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>5,181</td>       <td>25,370,800</td>       <td>246</td>       <td>968,100</td>       <td>5,427</td>       <td>26,338,900</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Strategy is a multi-modal, twenty year transport strategy for the region and one that must be reflected in relevant land-use strategies across the GDA.</p>  <p>  A Navan rail link was included in the draft GDA Transport Strategy as one of the proposed projects to be delivered by 2042. The Strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and a final version will ultimately be submitted for my approval in the coming months.</p>  <p>  If included in the final Strategy, this project will require significant planning and design before construction can commence. As it stands, the draft Strategy proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the Strategy period. The current National Development Plan provides capital funding to approved projects up to and including 2030.</p></reply>

The EU Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2) require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to be used for all electronic transactions. The Directive requires all online service providers to capture additional transaction information pertaining to the cardholder and to send this to the cardholder&rsquo;s bank. The cardholder&rsquo;s banks use this data to verify the cardholder, with the intention of making the transaction process as seamless as possible, and remove or reduce any extra layer of friction at the payment stage. The aim of the Directive is to reduce online fraud and increase cardholder confidence in using online services.</p><p>My Departments Online motor tax service, at <i>www.motortax.ie</i>, is fully compliant with the Directive's requirements. All necessary technical changes have been made to the website to facilitate the requirements, and my officials worked directly with the banking institutions, including the Bank referred to by the Deputy, to ensure any initial teething troubles were addressed.</p><p>It is important to note however the requirement ensures that electronic payments are performed with multi-factor authentication to increase the security of electronic payments. Such multi-factor authentication can require a cardholder having to download their bank&rsquo;s app on their mobile phone or tablet; or amend settings on the device to enable notifications to be received. This may require the cardholder having to engage directly with their bank to address any issues they may have in this regard. My officials also provide assistance for such issues.</p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department of Transport and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support SPSVs to switch to electric.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is available nationwide to persons applying for new SPSV licenses and existing SPSV license holders who wish to upgrade their current vehicle with a replacement EV. As per the terms and conditions of the scheme, it is important that an EV is not purchased prior to acceptance of a Grant Offer Letter by the Approved Applicant. Approved applicants in receipt of a Grant Offer Letter have an initial three months to draw down their grant. It is possible to apply for a further three month provisional grant offer extension if applicants have a letter from their dealer stating that the vehicle will be delivered within this timeframe. </p>  <p>  The scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers which usually have a time limit of three months.  I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the second half of the year.</p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>  The time lag is due to the fact that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives, such as the YAC, on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. An array of various ticketing equipment is in use on fleet used by the commercial operators and needs to be catered for. To expedite the process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card in as timely a manner as possible.</p>  <p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th   of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's  specific question in relation to the inclusion of commercial bus operators in the YAC scheme,  to the NTA for direct reply.

The prohibition also applies to vessels reflagged from the Russian flag after 24 February 2022.  My department communicated this prohibition in Marine Notice 19 of 2022 which was communicated to all ports and maritime stakeholders. On 3 June the EU adopted a further sixth package of sanctions which Ireland also fully supported.</p>  <p>  Almost all EU sanctions regimes provide for situations where, for various reasons, the sanctions do not apply. These may take the form of exemptions, which apply automatically, or derogations, for which an authorisation issued by a Competent Authority is required.  Sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine are no different. They contain numerous exceptions to ensure that sanctions are effective, implementable, and impact Russia more than they impact the EU.  Exemptions and derogations are included for very good reasons, including to ensure security of supply of food and other essential products on the European market.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE), through its Trade Licensing and Control Unit, is responsible for the implementation of trade sanctions in accordance with Ireland's international commitments and obligations as a member of the EU.  DETE is also a Competent Authority in Ireland for the purposes of Council Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia&rsquo;s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) 2022 /576. This Regulation makes provision for a national Competent Authority (DETE) to authorise a derogation from the prohibition of Russian Vessels entering Irish Ports on limited and very specific grounds.  The EU sanction prohibiting Russian-flagged vessels accessing EU ports has an explicit derogation to allow for the import of agricultural and food products. </p>  <p>In this role, since April 16th , DETE has informed the Department of Transport that following recommendations received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it had authorised derogations for four Russian flagged vessels to enter Irish ports. The Department of Transport subsequently informed the relevant ports of this authorisation. </p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing at EU level, in which Ireland participates, on possible further measures to be implemented and it is important that Ireland continues to move in step our EU partners in relation to sanctions imposed.</p></reply>

In 2021 there was a significant increase in expenditure on Active Travel infrastructure, with a spend of approx. &euro;185m. This is in addition to circa &euro;27m spent on Greenways in 2021.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant step-up in expenditure and reflects our ambition to progressively reach the overall target expenditure of &euro;360m as set out in the Programme for Government.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the main agency spearheading delivery of cycling and walking infrastructure, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Factors such as the impact of COVID restrictions on construction, planning issues and staffing constraints in local authorities have impacted the delivery of active travel infrastructure over 2020 and 2021. However, the larger budgets and projects are now bedding-in, new staff are being recruited by the local authorities specifically for active travel, and the situation is improving. We expect a much higher draw-down on available funds this year and increased delivery.</p>  <p>  This year I have made &euro;289m available to local authorities through the NTA to progress the delivery of approximately 1,200 Active Travel projects throughout the country. This will contribute to the development of almost 1,000km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure across Ireland by 2025.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that local authorities can also access funding sources through other Departments to support walking and cycling infrastructure development. The two most significant are the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), overseen by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The latter Department also supports leisure orientated walking and cycling through the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS).</p></reply>

The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the reduction of fares on public transport outside major cities, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication. </p><p>The Strategy acknowledges the need for sufficient provision of fast or top-up charging at strategic locations such as along motorways, to enable longer EV journeys and alleviate lingering public concerns such as range anxiety.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure including the development of a number of new infrastructure schemes.</p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>. </p><p>My Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of almost1 million EVs on the road.</p></reply>

Should unanticipated issues arise, daa now has appropriate escalation and triage mechanisms focused on ensuring no passengers will miss their flights.</p>  <p>  Minister Ryan and I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks and continue to engage with both the executive and chair of the daa to ensure that all that can be done is being done for passengers using Dublin Airport and to ensure that the reputational damage to the country from a business, travel, connectivity and tourism point of view is repaired. </p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost to provide free nationwide public transport to persons in full-time education, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The relief was introduced in 2001 and abolished from 2011 onwards.</p><p>Professional membership fees are deductible under section 114 TCA where those fees are incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily by an individual in the performance of the duties of his or her employment.</p><p>A review of the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions and professional body fees was carried out by my Department in 2016 and included in the 2016 report on tax expenditures published on Budget day 2016. The review may be found at the following link: .</p><p>In respect of the relief for trade union subscriptions, the review concluded that:</p><p>&quot;...  <i>analysis of the scheme using the principles laid down by the Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines shows that it fails to reach the evaluation threshold to warrant introduction in this manner.</i></p><p><i>The reinstatement of this tax relief would have no justifiable policy rationale and does not express a defined policy objective. Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join. There is no specific market failure that needs to be addressed by such a scheme, and it would consist largely of deadweight</i>.&quot;</p><p>In 2009 the Commission on Taxation recommended that the relief be discontinued as<i>&ldquo;membership of a trade union is likely to be influenced by the benefits of membership and may be a condition of employment. The value of the tax credit is unlikely to be a factor. Having regard to the significant element of deadweight associated with the tax relief, we consider that the relief should be discontinued&rdquo;</i>.</p><p>In 2020, my Department carried out a further analysis which took stock of where matters stand in relation to the issue of tax relief for trade union subscriptions and set out a number of policy options for consideration. This exercise suggested that, based on certain assumptions about numbers of beneficiaries, the measure could cost at least &euro;36.9 million if reintroduced at the same level of support as existed in 2010. However, it also drew attention to the potentially significant deadweight element which would accompany the measure. That analysis was published with the 2020 Tax Strategy Group papers at the following link: <i>assets.gov.ie/86995/006fad3c-ebb5-4b0e-b067-92f8102d6e43.pdf</i>.</p><p>On the particular issue of the tax treatment of trade union subscriptions versus the tax treatment of fees paid by individuals to professional bodies, the review concluded that there is a fundamental difference between membership of a professional body which is required to practice a profession and membership of a trade union, which is essentially, a personal choice. A tax deduction for fees paid to professional bodies is available where, for example, there is a statutory requirement for membership of a professional body or where there is a requirement for a practicing certificate or license.

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in the Finance Act 1999 (as amended). The Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account.</p><p>The minimum MOT rates that may be applied under the ETD, as well as the MOT rates (non-carbon and carbon components) currently in place, are set out in the following table. </p><p><b>Current MOT rates per 1,000L &amp;amp; Corresponding ETD minimum rates</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Fuel Type </th>       <th>ETD minimum &euro; </th>       <th>MOT non-carbon &euro; </th>       <th>MOT carbon &euro; </th>       <th>Total MOT &euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Petrol </td>       <td>359.00 </td>       <td>371.11 </td>       <td>94.87 </td>       <td>465.98 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Diesel </td>       <td>330.00 </td>       <td>295.64 </td>       <td>109.74 </td>       <td>405.38 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerosene </td>       <td>0.00 </td>       <td>0.00 </td>       <td>103.83 </td>       <td>103.83 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the estimated costs of reducing the current MOT rates for petrol, diesel and heating kerosene to the respective ETD minimum rates, for the period from 6 June 2022 until 12 October 2022 are set out in the below table. These estimated costs assume no behavioural change in response to such a reduction.</p><p><b>Cost of reducing MOT Rates to ETD Minimum</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Fuel Type </th>       <th>MOT &euro;m </th>       <th>VAT &euro;m </th>       <th>Total &euro;m </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Petrol </td>       <td>35.4 </td>       <td>6.6 </td>       <td>42 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Diesel </td>       <td>97.6 </td>       <td>5.7 </td>       <td>103.3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerosene </td>       <td>23.5 </td>       <td>2.8 </td>       <td>26.3 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Finally, I am advised by Revenue that the estimated cost of the Diesel Rebate Scheme, during the period from 6 June 2022 to 12 October 2022 is &euro;11.6m, based on volumes on which claims were received by Revenue in 2021.</p></reply>

Negative interest charges, when applicable, are therefore paid by the Department despite these being related to Government cash flows.

For this reason, the FSPO issues levy invoices on a staggered basis throughout the year, in order to reduce moneys held on deposit at any one time and thereby reduce negative interest charged. The FSPO continues to monitor announcements by credit institutions regarding any changes to negative interest rates and consults with the Office of Government Procurement on its banking services framework to explore suitable alternative options, as appropriate.</p><p>For completeness, superannuation contributions pertaining to two Model Schemes operating in the FSPO are being held by the FSPO in a Pension Account, which is included in the sum above, pending a decision by the Department of Finance on the proposed funding arrangements of the FSPO&rsquo;s Staff and FSPO&rsquo;s Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman superannuation schemes.  Superannuation contributions relating to the FSPO&rsquo;s Model Pension Schemes are held on deposit, and therefore attract negative interest charges.</p><p>**I am advised by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that the negative interest costs they incurred have risen significantly over the period due to two factors. Firstly, as the number of banks imposing these charges has increased it is no longer possible to minimise the charges by holding larger balances in banks that do not do so. Secondly, there was a particular increase in 2020 and 2021 due to Revenue of necessity holding significant amounts needed to fund Covid-19 related subsidy scheme payments. </p></reply>

Thus, there is no specific VRT treatment for vehicles that run on hydrotreated vegetable oil.</p>  <p>The VRT on a Category A vehicle (e.g. passenger car) is generally based on the vehicle&rsquo;s value and its emissions of CO2 (carbon dioxide) and NOx (nitrogen oxides), with higher emitting vehicles paying proportionately higher VRT than lower-emitting ones of the same value. The VRT on a Category B vehicle (e.g. van) is generally 13.3% of the value of the vehicle, and for a Category C vehicle (e.g. lorry, bus) the VRT charge is &euro;200.</p>  <p>  When imported from outside the European Union, or from within the European Union where a vehicle is a New Means of Transport (i.e. it is not more than 6 months old or has not more than 6,000 kilometres done), vehicles are subject to VAT at the standard rate, which at this time is 23%. Customs duty is also due on a vehicle imported from outside the EU; depending upon the point of origin of the vehicle, it is either charged at a 0% or 10% rate of the customs value of the vehicle.</p></reply>

In recognition of these pressures, a number of support measures are already in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include various tax-exempted<s></s>financial supports provided by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to assist parents to offset the costs of early learning and childcare and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>Budget 2022 announced the introduction of a number of direct expenditure measures to support parents in respect of childcare costs, including:</p><p>-  From May 2022, hours spent in the Early Childhood Care and Education pre-school programme or school will no longer be deducted from a family's entitlement to subsidised hours of care under the National Childcare Scheme.</p><p>-  From May 2022, a Transition Fund for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare providers will require participating providers to ensure no increase on parental fees from the September 2021 levels. This will be replaced in September 2022 by a new Core Funding stream which requires participating providers to maintain their fee levels at or below September 2021 levels.</p><p>-  From September 2022, the universal subsidy of the National Childcare Scheme will be extended to children aged up to 15.</p><p>These measures will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are felt by parents. </p><p>With regard to taxation measures, and separate to the above:</p><p>-The Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees. <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-01-11.pdf</i>.</p><p>- Individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home may claim childcare services relief each year, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income. <i>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/childcare-services/index.aspx</i>.</p><p>- A Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year. <i>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/single-person-child-carer-credit/index.aspx</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive many requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer and I must have regard to budgetary constraints and the equitable treatment of all tax-payers. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p><p>Providing a tax credit for parents in respect of childcare costs was considered by the Interdepartmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in 2015 and was deemed not to be the best approach to investing in affordability for parents. Further details of that consideration are available in that report: <i>assets.gov.ie/36162/37cc5033f3124062912a416088a48827.pdf</i>.</p><p>Therefore, I do not currently have any plans to introduce additional tax relief on the cost of childcare. </p></reply>

The strategy outlines the plan to increase affordability and housing supply by committed to, amongst other things, an average of 2,000 new &lsquo;cost rental&rsquo; homes every year, with targets of rents being at least 25 per cent below market level. Additionally, in respect of properties in rent pressure zones, since 11 December 2021 annual rent increases are limited to 2 per cent per annum or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.</p>  <p>  Tax relief in respect of rent paid was previously available to those paying for private rented accommodation, including rent paid for flats, apartments or houses. It did not include rent paid to local authorities. This relief was abolished in Budget 2011 following a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation. As such, it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 08 December 2010.</p>  <p>  The view of the independent Commission on Taxation (2009) was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation. Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would very likely be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the cost pressure on tenants. </p>  <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum and it is likely that this figure would be even higher today were a similar scheme to be put in place.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the foregoing, I have no plans, at present, to reintroduce a tax relief for home rental costs incurred for private rented accommodation.</p></reply>

This concessionary treatment continues to apply for 2022. It applies where the additional award is related to an employee's exceptional efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and where the employee continued to work during the restricted period.</p><p>All other conditions of section 112B TCA 1997 must be met, for example the maximum cumulative value of incentives must not exceed &euro;500 and the voucher or incentive must not be redeemable, in full or in part, for cash.  Appropriate documentation must be retained by an employer where this concession is availed of.</p><p>The overall cost of the increase proposed by the Deputy is difficult to estimate, and would depend very much on the take-up, the amounts awarded by employers and the tax situation of the employees.  No separate returns are required under the scheme so Revenue does not have statistics. </p><p>The scheme continues to be kept under review and any amendments would need to be considered in with reference to the Department&rsquo;s guidelines on tax expenditures, which make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures, where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention; and that the potential for deadweight and additionality are considered.</p><p>Any increase in the amounts allowable under scheme would create an additional cost which must be recovered elsewhere.</p></reply>

The properties securing NAMA&rsquo;s loans are owned by debtors. These debtors, or receivers in the case of enforcement, manage and control the properties. If a State body expresses interest in a property secured to NAMA, NAMA will facilitate engagement between the debtor / receiver and the relevant body. However, as secured creditor, NAMA cannot force a debtor or receiver to act in a manner that would hinder their ability to repay their loans, such as unduly withholding properties from sale or selling a property for less than market value. As regards the Bessboro site, I am advised that NAMA has no record of an approach by a State body seeking to purchase the site.  </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA is legally precluded from divulging confidential debtor information. Therefore NAMA cannot disclose the amount of the original loan attaching to the site.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA did not write down the related loan, nor was the site sold while it was secured to NAMA. Rather the loan was sold in July 2016 as part of a wider loan sale. It was at this point that NAMA&rsquo;s interest in the site ended. The Deputy should note that the sale of loans does not impact the ownership of the underlying properties.  </p></reply>

NAMA has enhanced this legislation with Asset Disposal and Loan Sale policies that are more wide-reaching than section 172. They encompass disposals of secured assets by debtors or receivers as well as loan assets being sold by NAMA. </p></reply>

This is a valuable relief from CAT and a fundamental objective of this relief is that it is availed of by genuine, and active farmers, and that it relates to agricultural land which is being actively farmed.</p>  <p>  One of the key conditions for agricultural relief is that agricultural property must make up at least 80% of a beneficiary&rsquo;s total property. Prior to the changes made in Finance Act 2017, any land leased for solar panels was not classified as agricultural land and therefore could not be counted towards satisfying this 80% threshold.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the then Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland and the potential role of farmland in achieving this, an amendment was made to allow land leased for solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity under certain conditions.  </p>  <p>  While introducing this amendment, it was important that sight was not lost of the fundamental principle which underpins agricultural relief policy, namely to support the intergenerational transfer of family farms and to encourage succession planning. Therefore, a key aspect of this relief is to ensure that it is targeted at land which is actively farmed. Consequently to facilitate the above policy objectives, the amendment included a condition that in order to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity, the total area under lease for solar should not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.  </p>  <p>  This addressed any potential disincentive to leasing land for solar panels, while also preserving the integrity of this significant CAT relief. </p></reply>

The RZLT is designed to prompt residential development by owners of land that is zoned for residential or mixed-use purposes and that is serviced. The RZLT is an annual tax, calculated at a rate of 3% of the market value of the land. </p>  <p>  Each local authority will prepare and publish a map identifying land within the scope of the tax. The first draft map will be published by the local authorities on 1 November 2022. </p>  <p>  The tax will be due and payable in May 2024 in respect of land which was suitable for residential development on 1 January 2022 because it was both zoned and serviced on that date, and on which development has not commenced before 1 February 2024. Where land becomes both zoned and serviced after 1 January 2022, tax will be chargeable in the third year after it comes within the scope of the tax.</p>  <p>  There are a limited number of exclusions from the tax, including residential dwellings and their gardens and land which is zoned for a mixture of residential and other uses (and not purely for residential development) that is integral to the operation of a business carried out on or beside it.</p>  <p>  If a landowner believes that their land should not be zoned as suitable for residential development, they can make a submission to the local authority seeking to have the land rezoned. The local authority will consider the submission and, if appropriate, they will commence a variation procedure to alter the zoning of the land.  This variation procedure, and the local authority&rsquo;s decision on whether or not to commence one, is part of the normal zoning process.</p>  <p>  The tax may be deferred in certain circumstances, including where residential development is commenced. Tax deferred while residential development is ongoing, will, on the making of a claim, not be payable where development is completed within the timeframe set out in the planning permission and a certificate of completion is in place.</p>  <p>  Where a site that is subject to RZLT is for sale, in the period until the sale is completed, the original owner is liable for the tax. Before the sale of a property is completed, the vendor is required to pay any unpaid RZLT due in respect of a liability date falling before the date of sale and to submit any outstanding returns. </p></reply>

It should be noted that the Minister for Finance has no direct function in the operations of banks operating in the State. This includes banks that the State is a shareholder, the Minister must ensure that these banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis. Actions taken by the banks are matters for the board and management of the institution.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s consumer protection framework is designed to ensure that customers&rsquo; best interests are protected. It requires regulated financial service entities to provide reasonable arrangements and/or assistance to people who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) applies to regulated financial service providers providing regulated activities within the State. Under the provisions of the Code the Central Bank expects that all regulated firms take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers. The Code contains a number of provisions aimed at ensuring that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services. </p>  <p>  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) collects data on the total number of bank operated ATMs cross the country. This has been declining in recent years mainly because banks have sold, mainly offsite, ATMs to Independent ATM Deployers (IADs) and more recently also due to branch closures.</p>  <p>  Latest data from the BPFI shows that in December 2021 there were 1,787 ATMs operated by banks, this is down from 2,353 in December 2020.  </p>  <p>  The BPFI do not have sight of whether the IADs maintains or closes ATMs after the purchase. However it estimates that the total number of ATM&rsquo;s (operated by banks and IADs) was approximately 2,900 in December 2021.</p></reply>

Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations. The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union. This is a European Commission initiative to mobilise capital in Europe, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.</p>  <p>  Securitisation involves the creation of tradeable securities out of an income stream or projected future income stream generated by financial assets.  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  Such financing is useful for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of finance to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is nothing specific in the Section 110 framework that is of particular relevance to Russian investors or originators and such vehicles are a common feature of financial service centres.</p>  <p>  In relation to Central Bank regulations, certain section 110 companies may be required to publish a prospectus under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the &ldquo;Prospectus Regulation&rdquo;), where an issuance of securities fall under its scope. The Prospectus Regulation applies to persons:</p>  <p>  -  Seeking admission of securities to trading on an EEA regulated market, including the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin, or</p>  <p>  -  Making an offer of securities to the public within the EEA, albeit not seeking admission to trading on an EEA regulated market.</p>  <p>  The Prospectus Regulation harmonises requirements for the drawing up, approval and distribution of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market. The objective of the Prospectus Regulation is to ensure investor protection and market efficiency, in accordance with high regulatory standards.  The Central Bank is the Competent Authority in Ireland with responsibility for the scrutiny and approval of prospectus documents under the Prospectus Regulation. The Central Bank scrutinises the prospectus to ensure it meets all of the disclosure requirements set out in the legislation and must approve the prospectus prior to commencement of the listing or offer of the securities to the public. </p>  <p>  Separately, Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) that carry out activities listed under Schedule 2 &ndash; a comprehensive list of financial activities of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 - are subject to supervision by the Central Bank for Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) purposes. Such firms are referred to as &ldquo;Schedule 2 firms&rdquo;. Firms obligated to register include those which participate in securities issues and the provision of services relating to such issues. An SPE is required to report to the Central Bank if it is an SPE which predominantly engages in securisations, and if it avails of the tax provisions of section 110.</p>  <p>  Schedule 2 firms are subject to the Central Bank&rsquo;s minimum engagement model and are supervised in accordance with this model. During the course of this supervision, where weaknesses in the AML/CFT frameworks are identified in Schedule 2 firms, the supervisors issue findings that the Schedule 2 firms are required to implement. The Central Bank conducts supervisory activities to ensure that Schedule 2 firms are complying with their statutory obligations. These activities include:</p>  <p>  -  Conducting on-site inspections and other supervisory engagements across the financial sector to effectively monitor that there is compliance and effective implementation of the relevant statutory obligations;</p>  <p>  -  Ensuring compliance with the requirements under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 to adopt and implement policies and procedures for the assessment and management of risks of money laundering and terrorist financing;</p>  <p>  -  Inspection of policies and procedures, and confirmation that senior management (including boards of directors) can demonstrate full awareness of their responsibilities;</p>  <p>  Separately, where an SPE is linked to an investment fund resident in Ireland, it is subject to the relevant investment fund regulations and requirements. </p>  <p>  I now refer to section 110 company&rsquo;s compliance with EU sanctions. All natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to ensure compliance with EU sanctions. This includes section 110 companies. A breach of financial sanction is a criminal offence. The Central Bank of Ireland, as the competent authority for financial sanctions, is undertaking work in relation to firms with links to Russia. Should the Central Bank identify, or have a suspicion of, a breach of sanctions it will report that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the investigative authority.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it carries out a programme of risk focused compliance interventions on section 110 companies, to monitor the regime and to satisfy itself as to the accuracy or otherwise of tax returns filed by these companies and to ensure they continue to meet all qualifying conditions. In line with its overall tax compliance monitoring programme, Revenue has a multi-faceted approach to tackling non-compliance. Compliance interventions range from non-audit compliance Interventions, such as appraisals, aspect queries, and profile interviews, to audits and investigations. As with all tax compliance interventions, Revenue will take appropriate action, including making assessments and seeking penalties and interest, where evidence of non-compliance is found to exist.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue has taken appropriate steps to identify section 110 companies subject to or linked to individuals, groups or entities subject to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus in connection with Ukraine. Revenue has the necessary procedures and processes in place to ensure full adherence with its obligations under EU sanctions rules. </p>  <p>  As respects section 110 companies identified as possibly linked to entities/individuals on the EU sanctions list, there have been 37 compliance interventions and 65 risk appraisals closed in respect of such companies in the last 5 years (none of which were formal audits). One compliance intervention is ongoing in respect of such a company.</p></reply>

Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations. Indeed the importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union.  </p><p>While section 110 companies are not subject to Central Bank authorisation, there are a number of conditions which a company must meet in order to be regarded as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;TCA 1997&rdquo;).</p><p>One of those conditions is that the company notifies Revenue of their intention to be a qualifying company by completing a Form S.110 no later than 8 weeks from the date the company commences its business as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 TCA 1997. As it is a requirement of section 110 TCA 1997, it is appropriate that the Form S.110 be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>Additionally, the activity of individual section 110 entities by virtue of its structure as a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) might be affected by certain regulations based on specific activities that they carry out. The obligations of SPEs under the relevant regulations are intended to increase transparency on their activities and address specific risks, such as in the areas of investor protection and Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).  </p><p>SPEs may be required to publish a prospectus under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the &ldquo;Prospectus Regulation&rdquo;), where an issuance of securities fall under its scope.

There are currently over 58,000 EVs registered on Irish roads (end April 2022). By 2030, the abatement impact for  an additional 845,000 passenger EVs is estimated to be c. 2.5 Mt C02eq. This figure is informed by the Department of Transport&rsquo;s modelling of the projected car fleet profile for Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  In support of achieving these missions reductions, there are already a significant number of grants/tax incentives available for the purchase of EVs including:</p>  <p>  -  Vehicle Registration Tax relief of up to &euro;5,000 for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). From January 2021, this relief is no longer available for BEVs with an Open market Selling Price of >&euro;50,000. This cap was introduced as a value for money consideration to ensure the reliefs remains targeted. </p>  <p>  -  Purchase Grant Scheme &ndash; provides up to &euro;5000 for the purchase of a BEV</p>  <p>  -  Home Charger Grant - Up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs.</p>  <p>  -  Low Motor Tax - BEVs qualify for the lowest tax band of motor tax at &euro;120 per annum, while a plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV)  is typically taxed at circa &euro;170 per annum.</p>  <p>  -  BEVs qualify for a Benefit-in-Kind exemption of up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions.</p>  <p>  -  BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles</p>  <p>  -  A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with up to &euro;20K available for a new BEV, &euro;25K for a new wheelchair accessible BEV and &euro;15K for a new wheelchair accessible PHEV.</p>  <p>  -  Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme - grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that the Government has provided a broad suite of supports for the uptake of EVs. Given the availability of the above grants/tax incentives there are currently no plans to introduce a vehicle registration tax credit for vehicles with an open market selling price in excess of &euro;50,000.</p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT. </p>  <p>  The Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that under Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rules, the supplier of passenger transport services does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and, consequently, has no VAT recovery entitlement on their input costs. In accordance with the EU rules, Ireland may continue to apply this existing, historic VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport but, for as long as the exemption remains, the conditions under which the exemption was granted cannot be changed. In fact, the introduction of a new entitlement to VAT recovery for the passenger transport sector could only be done if Ireland were to decide to end its historic exemption for the sector, and bring passenger transport services into the VAT net;  this would then require suppliers to register for VAT and charge VAT on their passenger fares.</p>  <p>  A VAT-registered trader is generally entitled to deduct VAT charged on the purchase or hire of a motor vehicle for use in their business if the vehicle comes within the definitions of Category B or Category C vehicles for the purposes of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). If such a vehicle is used exclusively for business purposes, the VAT is deductible in the normal way. Vehicles within VRT Categories B &amp;amp; C, such as vans and lorries are generally deductible for VAT, and these are often referred to as commercial vehicles for VAT purposes. However, buses or minibuses suitable for carrying between 12 and 16 persons (including the driver) are not generally deductible for VAT, although they come within Category C, as they are normally used for the VAT exempt activity of passenger transport.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also maintained a relieving provision, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012, which provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport. However, it should be noted that extending the scope of the Order while maintaining VAT exemption for passenger transport would be contrary to the EU VAT Directive. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose between providers. It is also my understanding that insurance companies consider their pricing structure in accordance with their own past claims experience.</p>  <p>  I would note that the second Implementation Report of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, published in March this year, showed that insurance reform is progressing well, with some 80% of actions in the Plan now being delivered, and the remaining initiated. It is my hope that the cumulative impact of these reforms will be to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for businesses, as well as consumers and other groups &ndash; including landlords.</p>  <p>  It may interest the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. Likewise, Brokers Ireland provide assistance to customers who are experiencing insurance accessibility issues; they can be contacted on insurancequeries@brokersireland.ie. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would highlight that the issue of local authority and social housing more generally falls under the remit of the Minister of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, while policy in respect of rent supplement payments and Housing Assistance Payments is the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

These arrangements are overseen by a long-established, high-level group of senior officials from both organisations that meets on a quarterly basis.</p><p>Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 permits Revenue to disclose taxpayer information where, amongst other things, the disclosure is permitted by another enactment. Section 851A(6)(a) specifically permits Revenue to disclose taxpayer information where a Revenue officer has a suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed but only to an investigation authority. For this purpose, an &lsquo;investigation authority&rsquo; is defined as &ldquo;a statutory body responsible for the investigation of alleged criminal offence&rdquo;. The DSP is such an authority.</p><p>Section 851B(1)(d) provides a legal basis for the processing of taxpayer information, which includes disclosing the information or data by transmitting, disseminating or otherwise making it available.</p><p>I am further advised that the mutual exchange of data is a critical component in the effective and efficient functioning of both organisations.  A wide range and volume of data is, consequently, exchanged on both a systematic and a case specific basis, all of which is underpinned by extensive enabling legislation, principally, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  In addition, the exchange of information is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding agreed between Revenue and DSP and by signed Data Exchange Agreements which list the detail of the exchanges. </p><p>Given the importance of taxpayer confidentiality to its activities, compliance with Data Protection (including GDPR) obligations is a major consideration for Revenue.  I am advised that Revenue continually reviews its data exchange arrangements, even where these are long-standing ones, to ensure that they are in keeping with best practice. Where new sources of data are being exchanged, as happened recently with the introduction of the Wage Subsidy Schemes, Revenue will examine the detail of the proposed exchange to ensure that it adheres to all Data Protection requirements.</p><p>With regard to the number of instances, from 2019 to date in 2022, when the DSP received data from Revenue for the purposes of investigating potential social protection fraud, Revenue has provided the following summary information. <table>    <tr>       <th>Category of data</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022 year to date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Case specific   enquiries to support work of Special Investigations Unit</td>       <td>1,403</td>       <td>1,212</td>       <td>1,616</td>       <td>641</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Value of   deposit interest paid to check compliance on means tested payments</td>       <td>313</td>       <td>131</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PUP requests from DSP</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>4,273</td>       <td>1,778</td>       <td>83</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate of VAT or exempt from VAT.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Directive, the supply by a taxable person of a lease or letting of immovable property, such as farmland, is an exempt activity subject to conditions, therefore, the payment for the lease or letting is not liable to VAT. Each lease or letting agreement is determined on its own merits as to whether it constitutes an exempt letting for VAT purposes. </p>  <p>  A landlord can also exercise the option to charge VAT on the rent of a lease or letting of immovable property. When a landlord leases or lets the immovable property, they must do one of the following to confirm the option to tax: include a written provision for the taxation of the rent in the letting agreement, or issue a document to the tenant stating that VAT is chargeable on the letting. The lease or letting in these circumstances is subject to the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%.</p></reply>

This is a well-established and broadly accepted principle. </p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit. Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment. Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112. </p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system. However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return. It is important to point out that such tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities and this legislation will prohibit the practice of using tips or gratuities to top up wages. It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff. In addition, the legislation will provide transparency to customers so they will know what the policy is on tips and service charges, how they are managed and to whom they go.</p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined in the opening paragraphs of my reply, I have no plans to amend the tax treatment of tips and gratuities.</p></reply>

By way of indication that the industry is responding positively to the reform agenda, I understand that in the complementary play centre sector an additional provider has recently expanded its existing product line and now offers group insurance. This may prompt other firms to expand their product range and cover. In addition, Cabinet recently approved proposals to overhaul the duty of care to address issues associated with &lsquo;slips, trips and falls&rsquo;, which predominate in footfall-heavy sectors such as childcare.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p><p>Every person intending to use a vehicle on a public road must have third-party insurance cover at a minimum. Therefore, it is important that motor insurance is affordable, which is why the Government has continued to focus on reducing costs for motorists, as well as other groups, through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. </p><p>This whole-of-Government strategy contains several initiatives expected to positively impact motor insurance costs. For example, the new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with the latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) indicating that the overall average award has reduced by 42% compared to 2020. Consistent implementation of the Guidelines should therefore lead to a reduction in the cost of claims, including motor claims, which accounted for 70% of all awards made by the PIAB in 2020. </p><p>Another key achievement with respect to motor insurance has been the publication of new Regulations by the Central Bank to ban price walking, following its extensive review. Price walking is where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. I therefore welcome this imminent move, as I believe it will protect motor insurance customers who prefer to stay with their current insurer from being unfairly penalised for doing so, in terms of the premium paid.</p><p>According to data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for April 2022, motor insurance prices declined by nearly 15% from September 2020, when the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is driving these initiatives, was established. Overall, motor insurance prices are now 40% lower than their peak in July 2016, which I believe indicates that previous reforms under the <i>Cost of Insurance Working Group</i>, as well as recent achievements of the Insurance Reform Action Plan, are having a positive effect. This downward trend of motor insurance prices is also validated by data from the National Claims Information Database (NCID), with the latest motor report indicating that the average earned premium per policy peaked at &euro;708 in Q4 2017, and declined by 16% to &euro;595 in Q4 2020. I expect that the next NCID report on private motor insurance, due later this year, will show a continued decrease in insurance prices, as the impact of the various Government reforms in this area continue to bed in and take effect.</p></reply>

During this period, the individual was resident in the Netherlands and worked with several different shipping companies which were registered in different countries. While it is not possible to give definitive answers based on the information supplied the following general information is relevant. If the person wants to clarify his or her tax treatment, he or she should contact Revenue.  </p><p><b><i>Tax treatment of income in Ireland</i></b></p><p>An international seafarer who is resident and domiciled in the State will be subject to Irish income tax on his or her worldwide income, including income derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters. Section 819(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides that an individual is resident in the State for tax purposes for a tax year if he or she is present in the State for:</p><p>i. 183 days in that tax year, or</p><p>ii. 280 days between that tax year and the previous tax year, with a minimum of 30 days in either tax year. </p><p>With respect to tax incentives applying to those working in the commercial maritime sector, section 472B TCA 1997 provides for the Seafarers&rsquo; Allowance. </p><p>The Seafarers&rsquo; Allowance provides an allowance of &euro;6,350 to individuals working in the shipping transport sector. Along with other conditions, an individual who wishes to claim the allowance must be at sea for at least 161 days in the course of the year and carry out their work wholly on-board a sea-going ship while on an international voyage. Further information in relation to the Seafarers&rsquo; Allowance is available in <i>Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-30 - Seafarer Allowance </i>on the Revenue website. </p><p>This incentive may only be claimed by Irish residents assessable to income tax under Schedule D or Schedule E (i.e. self-employed or an employee). In general, non-resident individuals are not entitled to any of the normal personal credits, reliefs, and deductions, including the Seafarers&rsquo; Allowance. However, in certain circumstances, full or apportioned tax credits, reliefs or deductions may be available under section 1032 TCA 1997.  Apportioned tax credits are calculated based on the proportion which the income of the non-resident which is assessable to Irish tax, bears to their total worldwide income. </p><p><b><i>Tax treatment of income overseas</i></b></p><p>In general, the state where an international seafarer is liable to tax on income derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters will depend on a number of different factors, including, but not restricted to the following:</p><p>-  the domestic tax rules in the state of residence of the seafarer;</p><p>-  the tax rules applying to the employment income of international seafarers in the state where:</p><p>-  the employment is held and from where the employment income is paid</p><p>-  the vessel is registered</p><p>-  the vessel is managed.</p><p>On this basis, it is not possible to confirm that a person who works in international waters for more than 185 days in a year is exempt from paying income tax or social insurance contributions on their income to any state.</p><p>In cases where the employment income of the international seafarer is subject to tax under the domestic tax rules of two jurisdictions, the terms of a double taxation agreement (DTA) concluded between these jurisdictions may apply to alleviate double taxation. In such instances, Article 15(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides that two jurisdictions may agree that remuneration which is derived from an employment exercised aboard a ship operated in international traffic is taxable in the country in which the place of effective management of the operator of the ship is located. </p><p>For example, an international seafarer who is resident and domiciled for Irish tax purposes will be subject to Irish income tax on his or her worldwide income, including that derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters. If the seafarer is subject to tax on this income in another jurisdiction with which the State has a DTA, then the income may be relieved from double taxation in accordance with the terms of the DTA. </p></reply>

The scope is confined to multination groups with turnover in excess of &euro;20 billion annually. Residual profit is profit greater than 10% of turnover. </p>  <p>  Pillar Two provides that the minimum effective rate is 15% for multinational enterprises with annual turnover in excess of &euro;750m.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Agreement will bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework arising from discussions which have taken place.</p>  <p>  The implementation timeframe for both Pillars is ambitious as acknowledged recently by the Secretary General of the OECD.  However, I am fully committed to delivering both pillars of the agreement as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Intensive work is ongoing, both at the OECD and EU, to reach agreement on the technical detail required in both Pillars to ensure that these complex provisions are transposed robustly and in co-ordination by all signatories to the agreement.</p>  <p>  An intensive programme of meetings is ongoing at the OECD to ensure that the Agreement can be translated into rules which ultimately can become legislation. My officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners are endeavouring to shape the rules to ensure that they provide the necessary tax certainty, are administrable for business and tax administrations, and remain broadly faithful to the October Agreement.</p>  <p>  On Pillar One the OECD have divided the work into 14 building blocks necessary to implement Pillar One.  Each block is sent to public consultation as part of the development process and these elements will eventually form the Pillar One Model Rules.</p>  <p>  These model rules, which will govern the reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions, are to be delivered through a Multilateral Convention. This will be both legally and legislatively challenging to develop and deliver.  </p>  <p>  Pillar Two is more advanced. The OECD published Model Rules in December 2021 and published a commentary to these rules in March of this year.  The Model Rules provide an important framework to assist individual jurisdictions to implement the Global Minimum Effective Tax Rate in a coordinated and consistent manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the OECD&rsquo;s Implementation Framework to deal with further implementation issues, such as coexistence with the US GILTI regime, and the GloBE information return.</p>  <p>  In the EU, work on delivering Pillar Two into legislation through the Minimum Tax Directive is very advanced. I am fully supportive of the efforts of the French presidency towards reaching unanimous agreement of the Directive and am optimistic that unanimous agreement can be reached at ECOFIN soon.</p>  <p>  The EU Minimum Tax Directive now provides for implementation by 31 December 2023, which is in line with the OECD agreement of 2023 implementation.  This remains faithful to the original deadline, while recognising the complex work required of both tax administrations and businesses in order to introduce and operate these rules effectively.</p>  <p>  Domestically, a public consultation has recently been launched on the implementation of Pillar Two into Ireland&rsquo;s tax code and I encourage all interested parties to engage with this consultation.</p></reply>

In addition, I have conducted numerous bilateral meetings with Eurogroup Ministers, EU Commissioners, and the President of the European Central Bank to ensure the achievement of Eurogroup objectives.</p>  <p>  The Eurogroup has focused on a variety of policy areas, with economic recovery from Covid being a key focus throughout that period. The euro area&rsquo;s economic recovery has been impressive with a return to pre-crisis GDP levels by the end of 2021. This recovery is attributable to the co-ordinated supportive fiscal stance of member states, which has protected jobs and income with euro area unemployment rate now at its lowest level on record.  </p>  <p>  The Eurogroup played an essential role in coordinating this response across member states, and also coordinating with other EU supports such as the European Central Bank&rsquo;s monetary policy response to Covid; and with the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s three safety nets, including the &euro;100 billion SURE scheme which protected 30 million jobs, the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s &euro;200 billion pandemic guarantee fund, and the European Stability Mechanism &euro;240 billion Pandemic Crisis Support.  </p>  <p>  In recent months, the Eurogroup&rsquo;s economic discussions have been dominated by Russia&rsquo;s war of aggression against Ukraine. Member States have worked together to give a firm response to this aggression against a European state and the European Union has once again shown its ability to rise to the challenge in the most difficult of times. Euro area Governments have been taking action to respond to the increase in energy prices and the surge in inflation.  In these turbulent times, the common currency has offered an anchor of stability for the euro area and the EU as a whole, which is demonstrated by the strong implementation of Greece&rsquo;s programme of assistance, and Croatia&rsquo;s intention to join the euro area as of 2023.</p>  <p>  The Eurogroup has worked to deepen the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) including by strengthening the Banking Union, on which discussions are currently ongoing. This will build on the Eurogroup agreement in November 2020 on European Stability Mechanism Treaty reform and the early introduction of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, which has been ratified by almost all member states. </p>  <p>  The Eurogroup is also addressing longer-term policies, by feeding political considerations into the European Central Bank&rsquo;s potential development of a digital euro. </p>  <p>  These Eurogroup policies have been complemented by greater Eurogroup international structured engagement, which has seen the attendance of Secretary Yellen and a broad array of speakers.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p><p>In considering the case for such a tax it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.</p><p>The LPT returns included questions such as whether a property is vacant, the reasons for the vacancy and if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. The aim was to provide an indicative profile of vacant residential properties which will help to inform policy.  It should be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system. </p><p>Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. I will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns shortly.</p></reply>

The income declared amounted to &euro;1.1 billion.</p>  <p>  As indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his question no. 208 dated 2 June 2022, Revenue have advised that, while it is possible to identify the rental income returned, the final tax liability of persons in receipt of such income takes account of a combination of all incomes, reliefs, credits, and deductions available to the taxpayer. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the exact tax liability associated with rental income. Additionally, I am advised by Revenue that the duration of tenancies is not declared on tax returns. As such, it is not possible to provide a costing in relation to the proposed disregard.</p>  <p>  At present, I have no plans to introduce a relief along the lines of that outlined by the Deputy. A point to be borne in mind is that under the Rent-a Room scheme, once the income exceeds the ceiling of &euro;14,000, the entire income amount becomes liable to tax.</p>  <p>  In addition, and as the Deputy will be aware, proposals for any new tax reliefs must be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p></reply>

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has responsibility for the AMIF while the ESF is managed by the Department of Further and Higher Education. </p>  <p>  The CARE Regulation introduced four main changes to cohesion policy rules to maximise the speed and ease with which Member States can help people fleeing Ukraine, while continuing to support regions' recovery:</p>  <p>  -  It extended the time for availing of 100% EU co-financing for 2014-2020 Cohesion policy funding;</p>  <p>  -  It allowed full flexibility for Member States and regions to use resources from either the European Fund for Regional Development (ERDF) or the European Social Fund (ESF) for any type of measures to support people fleeing Ukraine;</p>  <p>  -  It backdated eligibility for Member State spending on all actions helping people fleeing Ukraine to the start date of the Russian invasion (24 February 2022);and</p>  <p>  -  It simplified the reporting and the programme modifications requirements.</p>  <p>  Member States were also permitted to use existing funds not yet programmed under the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), a post-COVID recovery package and all unallocated resources under the current 2014-2020 funding period where programmes are drawing to a close. Ireland is making use of remaining unallocated funding under the European Regional Development Fund (&euro;0.4m) and REACT-EU (&euro;53m) for this purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working closely with other Government Departments and agencies to determine the range of existing activities supporting Ukrainian refugees which could be financed under this mechanism. It is anticipated that these may include:</p>  <p>  -  Use of a straightforward, ready-to-use unit cost or &lsquo;Simplified Cost Option&rsquo; (SCO) to provide for a per capita payment of &euro;40 for up to 13 weeks for each Ukrainian refugee. This will support a number of measures assisting Ukrainian refugees on arrival in Ireland including, for example, reception, processing and transport; </p>  <p>  -  Short-term and medium term accommodation.</p>  <p>  Funding will be disbursed through programme activities under the European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund over the period up to July 2023. Programme beneficiaries will submit claims for expenditure on eligible activities and be reimbursed.</p></reply>

Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.

Some headline measures include increases in social protection payments, Fuel Allowance and Working Family Payment; health affordability measures; social and affordable housing funding, and enhanced student and childcare supports. Budget 2022 also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion euro.</p>  <p>  Since December 2021, over half a billion euro of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs. A number of these measures build on supports put in place in Budget 2022. A summary of the main measures is as follows:</p>  <p>  -  An Energy Credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs.  </p>  <p>  -  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in Fuel Allowance payments introduced in Budget 2022, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit over 370,000 households. </p>  <p>  -  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment. The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.</p>  <p>  -  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the Drugs Payment Scheme. This will reduce medicines and drugs costs for over 70,000 recipients. </p>  <p>  -  A temporary 20% reduction in Public Service Obligation Public Transport fares until the end of 2022 to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.</p>  <p>  -  The maximum annual School Transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year.</p>  <p>  -  A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licensed heavy goods vehicle for a period of eight weeks. This scheme reflects the vital role that hauliers play in the supply.</p>  <p>  To provide further support towards mitigating fuel cost increases, the Department of Finance have introduced temporary reductions in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and have reduced the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity.</p>  <p>  Together, these measures provide substantial assistance towards mitigating the impact of rising prices. Overall, the Government has sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation. </p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, I will engage with my colleague the Minister for Finance in preparation for the Summer Economic Statement. This will outline the broad economic and fiscal parameters for Budget 2023. </p></reply>

Where there are landlord controlled areas, access audits make recommendations for improvements and as these have to be agreed with the landlord, these often take several years to complete.</p><p>In some cases these alterations require planning permission to granted, alterations designed, costed and approved before any works to alter these buildings and facilities can commence. They usually involve site-specific solutions to enable Public Access for all and the provision of a range of facilities as set out under the Statutory obligations of the Building Regulations. They are either provided for the public in specific parts of the building, or attendant services areas like car parks and reception and waiting areas to comply with the Disability Act 2005.</p><p>In addition, staff with specific disabilities or who develop a disability may be provided with alterations to their place of work. These can cost up to &euro;50K for minor alterations, or significantly more if the building is a protected structure or if for example, the circulation route to the officer&rsquo;s workstation requires a series of automated doors to provide access.</p><p>New buildings have to comply with the Universal Accessibility statutory requirements, as set out under Irish Law. There are a number of points of note informing the discussion on existing buildings. These points relate to the requirement to carry out access audits, involving the insights of the users of the building and/or availing of the user experiences of disability groups available to assist the designers in assessing the facilities.</p><p>1.  Accessibility Audits of building stock:</p><p>Accessibility Audits have been undertaken by the Office of Public Works, as part of the Universal Access Works Programme, since 2017. Audits are completed on a country-wide basis. They are undertaken by suitably qualified consultants. Recent audits recently undertaken include: Rosslare Garda Station, Tinahely Garda Station, Freshford Garda Station and Kilmore Quay Garda Station. These audits lead to the design, tendering and provision of improvements to the areas accessible to the public. This is a rolling programme, funded under the provisions of the Universal Access Budget which originated for the purposes of achieving compliance with Section 25 of the Disability Act 2005.</p><p>2.  Changing Places Facilities:</p><p>OPW awaits the publication of the <i>Changing Places</i>legislation and will take steps to ensure compliance and facilitate the public in accordance with the conditions contained within that framework, when enacted. The locations to be chosen for the provision of Changing Places facilities will be finalised, following further investigation as to the suitability of the sites and the potential of the existing facilities to be successfully altered or extended. They are not currently required to be provided under Irish law.</p></reply>

Therefore, we do not hold data related to details of projects approved under the Code.</p><p>For an extensive list of projects that are currently planned as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Deputy might consider the Investment Projects and Programme tracker, which was updated in May 2022. The tracker provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments with an estimated cost of greater than &euro;20 million, including the location of the projects where possible.  The tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to Galway. The tracker also includes a facility to search by county and user-friendly dashboards and other information to aid interpretation of the data.</p><p>Accompanying the tracker, the myProjectIreland interactive map includes over 1,100 projects across the country and provides details on specific projects by county, including smaller investments such as schools and social housing projects. By clicking on the map on gov.ie/2040, citizens will find updated information on what has been achieved and what is planned for their own local area.  The latest version of the map features a dashboard with charts, allowing citizens to see the progress being made on projects at a glance.  Search facilities also allow citizens to view projects in their regional area, by city, by county or by eircode.  </p><p>In addition, Regional Reports on the implementation of Project Ireland 2040 in the Northern and Western Region have been published for 2018, 2019 and 2020, with the 2021 report to be published shortly.  The reports set out the regional projects and programmes, which are being planned and delivered in the Northern and Western Region as part of the public investment detailed in Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.  While this document does not provide an exhaustive list of all public capital expenditure in the region, it does serve to highlight the diverse range of investments being made by the State under Project Ireland 2040, including in County Galway.</p><p>The Project Ireland 2040 Regional Reports, capital investment tracker and myProjectIreland interactive map are all available on gov.ie/2040.</p></reply>

As the greatest annual gathering under the auspices of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the Fleadh is principally organised at community level by the local branches in partnership with the local authority, media and other partners and sponsors. I am conscious that Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann was founded in Mullingar in 1951 and of the tremendous support that endures there for the organisation.   </p>  <p>  With regard to my general engagements with those involved in organising the Fleadh Cheoil, although constrained by pandemic controls I was delighted to meet online with the Chairman and members of the Fleadh Committee as they prepared for the 2022 event.  In recognition of the special challenges arising from the revitalisation of the Fleadh after two missed events, I approved a special support arrangement for this year on an exceptional basis of &euro;100,000.   I am confident that this support will be tremendously amplified by the community effort to ensure that Fleadh Cheoil 2022 will be a great festival enjoyed by the many visitors to Mullingar and countless thousands more around the world through the broadcasting and online presentations.</p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.11 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.  </p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,106 applications were submitted. </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.14 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May. The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital projects represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  </p>  <p>  The priority in the short term is to advance the 2,895 successful applications under the 2020 round to "formal approval" and grant drawdown stage which requires detailed engagement with all grantees. Now that the appeal process is complete, my Department will also undertake a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.11 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.  </p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,106 applications were submitted. </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.14 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May. Of the appeals submitted, a small proportion were unsuccessful, including the organisation referenced by the Deputy. The club in question has already been advised that its appeal was unsuccessful due to failure to demonstrate registered title in the required format under the terms and conditions of the Programme.

The total number of licences sold by An Post in 2021 was 951,454, with resultant revenue from licence sales amounting to &euro;150.9m.  In addition, the average number of free licences issued by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) during 2021 was 478,482. The amount received by my Department from DSP in respect of these free licences amounted to &euro;69.8m. Total licence fee receipts in 2021 therefore amounted to &euro;220.7m. </p>  <p>  With regard to the disbursement of television licence fee revenues, the Broadcasting Act makes provision for the payment of a commission to An Post in respect of its work in issuing television licences. The Act also provides for the disbursement of 7% of net licence fee receipts (i.e. total receipts less commission paid to An Post) to the Broadcasting Fund, administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which supports both the Sound and Vision (S&amp;V) and Archiving Schemes.  The balance of licence fee revenue is paid to RT&Eacute;.  The licence fee distribution in 2021 was &euro;9.9m to An Post, &euro;14.7m to BAI and &euro;196.1m to RT&Eacute;.  Both the BAI and RT&Eacute; provide further detail of how this funding is spent in their Annual Reports and Accounts.  The 2021 Reports will be published in the Autumn.</p></reply>

The County and City Management Association (CCMA) are leading on this initiative with support from my Department.  The pilot will run for a two year period and my Department will cover the costs of the Night-Time Advisors, subject to the normal budgetary estimates process in 2023. The CCMA recently issued a call for applications to all local authorities for the six pilot towns/cities which will close on the 24th June. An evaluation committee with membership from the CCMA, DTCAGSM and an external independent member will review each application.</p>  <p>  Towns and cities in two categories will be selected by the evaluation committee &ndash; three towns between 5,000 and 10,000 and three town/cities above 10,000, and they will be assessed using the following criteria:</p>  <p>  - Selected pilots must meet either of the two categories (between 5,000 and 10,000 or above 10,000)</p>  <p>  - The proposed pilot must clearly outline potential opportunities and current gaps to be addressed in the proposed pilot area, for the development of a more vibrant, diverse and sustainable Night-Time Economy. </p>  <p>  - The proposed pilot must demonstrate a willingness to develop a broad NTE offering, including recreational, cultural, and commercial offerings, across a range of time-spans and catering for a diverse range of stakeholder groups. </p>  <p>  - The proposed pilot must demonstrate a commitment to a wide-ranging consultation/engagement process with new and existing stakeholders in the city or town.  </p>  <p>  - The proposed pilot must identify potential assets and potential funding streams which could be accessed for the pilot (assets could include buildings, outdoor spaces, organisations, individuals, etc.) which could contribute to a more vibrant Night-Time Economy.</p>  <p>  - The proposed pilot must demonstrate the provision of administrative/organisational support for the new Advisor Post and new Committee and identify a future long-term structure should the pilot be successful.  </p>  <p>  Once appointed, the Night-Time Advisor will establish a Night-Time Economy Committee which will consist of artists, cultural facilities, event promoters, festival organisers, hospitality interests, local champions, public bodies, retailers and other businesses, residents, venue owners/operators.  The Advisor will ensure that all existing local structures are assessed to ensure synergies are developed where possible and that duplication of effort is avoided.</p>  <p>  A key element of this initiative will also include an extensive consultation process led by the Advisor, who will engage the local community in the process of developing ideas for the NTE in their own locality. The Advisor will develop a cohesive action plan for the specific town/city and it will contain key deliverables, including a range of proven interventions and the identification of potential funding streams to support the NTE in the chosen cities/towns.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the establishment and work of the Night-Time advisors, as it will be another significant step towards securing a vibrant and importantly a more sustainable night-time culture for all our citizens.</p></reply>

While a potentially smaller piece of the overall response, it can help meet accommodation needs where other accommodation is not readily available.</p>  <p>  I have also established an Emergency Vacant Housing Delivery Unit in the LGMA, as well as a Ukraine Accommodation Unit in my own Department, to support local authorities and public bodies in repurposing vacant public and private buildings as temporary multi-occupancy accommodation. Over 500 properties have been identified and analysed to date, with 90 or so capable of accommodating around 5,300 persons already notified to D/CEDIY. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have since been requested to submit further proposals for priority refurbishment of vacant buildings suitable as temporary multi-occupancy accommodation in their respective areas. The aim is to provide an initial 3,100 beds, with approximately 100 beds available in each local authority area. Further phases of this programme will follow in line with the need identified by D/CEDIY.</p>  <p>  To meet increased demand for housing arising from the unexpected and urgent need to accommodate persons from Ukraine, I also established a Clearing House Group to examine contractual, operational and compliance matters associated with planning permissions. The Group, comprising a small number of experts, will recommend measures to address blockages and constraints to residential and student accommodation development, as well as related local infrastructure required to facilitate housing. These measures may include using emergency planning powers under the Planning and Development Acts. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued delivery of Housing for All. Any new accommodation developed in response to the humanitarian crisis will be separate and additional to Housing for All targets. That said, any suitable permanent accommodation delivered through these measures will be directed to social and affordable housing when the crisis resolves.</p></reply>

All private landlords, Approved Housing Bodies and providers of Student Specific Accommodation are required to register their tenancies with the RTB. This allows the RTB to collect and provide definitive data on the rental sector and for transparency through the public register of tenancies; thus, enabling a better understanding of the sector. </p>  <p>  Section 136 of the RTA requires, inter alia, that when a landlord is registering a tenancy with the RTB, &lsquo;the name, address where the landlord ordinarily resides, any other address for correspondence the landlord may wish to provide and the personal public service number (if any) of the landlord and, where the application is made by his or her authorised agent, the name, address for correspondence and personal public service number (if any) of the agent&rsquo;, and &rsquo;such other matters as may be prescribed&rsquo;, must be provided as part of the application process. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (Prescribed Forms) Regulations 2022 sets out the prescribed form to be completed by landlords when applying to register a tenancy in compliance with section 134 of the RTA, which includes a requirement for the landlords date of birth. </p>  <p>  Following the passing of legislation in 2019, with effect from 4 April 2022, landlords are required to register their tenancies with the RTB every year, within one month of the anniversary of when the tenancy began. This applies to both new and existing tenancies. To further assist landlords in this changeover to annual registration, there is a four-month transition period for tenancies which commence or have renewal anniversaries between 4 April and 3 July 2022. This transition period ends on 3 August 2022. </p>  <p>  For data protection reasons, the names of landlords and tenants are not published on the RTB&rsquo;s public register of tenancies. </p>  <p>Should further information be required by the Deputy, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose and may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie. </p></reply>

The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Traveller-specific accommodation is focused primarily on the provision of group housing schemes and halting sites including the acquisition of properties and the provision of mobiles and caravans in certain circumstances. The timeline for the initiation, design, planning approval, tendering and contract management of Traveller-specific accommodation can take several years with the exception of the acquisition of properties and the provision of mobiles and caravans.  Therefore, payments made from the Traveller-specific accommodation budget over the last year in respect of construction projects would not give a reliable indication of average costs, as they may not include all payments from initiation to completion in respect of a sufficient quantity of projects to provide a reliable average cost.</p>  <p>  Average costs can be provided for 2021 in respect of the acquisition of homes and the provision of mobiles and caravans. Under the provision of completed acquisitions, the average cost in 2021 was almost &euro;280,000. Under the provision of emergency mobiles/caravans the average cost to my Department was in the region of &euro;11,000 in 2021. This represents 50% of the actual average cost as local authorities fund 50% of the cost under the emergency replacement scheme. Under the provision of mobiles/caravans provided during the Covid emergency response, my Department funded 100% of the costs and the average cost in 2021 was in the region of &euro;33,000.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie</i>. To date, &euro;158.7m has been spent on the scheme since it was established in 2014, this includes &euro;7m in 2022.

The grant value of applications currently Stage 1 approved under the scheme is approximately &euro;105 million. There is a very significant time lag before Stage 2 submissions are received by local authorities as applicants have their remediation works designed, the works costed by their chosen contractor and planning permission, if required, is secured.

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme. </p><p>In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department. </p><p>An annualised breakdown of the total funding provided and the number of properties upgraded under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021 is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/</i>.</p><p>My Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme in 2020-2022, the details of which are found below.

Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. The programme has been devised in a way to give local authorities a level of flexibility when selecting properties to retrofit ranging from those requiring minor levels of works to properties needing the maximum level of retrofitting required to bring them to a B2/Cost Optimum standard. </p><p>Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department.

I am satisfied that the suite of measures under the pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock will prove effective in comprehensively addressing vacant homes issues.</p></reply>

With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment. Then, intensive work continues on these issues once they are housed. Housing First has been a key element of Government homelessness policy.   </p>  <p>  The Housing First approach to addressing homelessness places direct access to housing first and foremost for vulnerable individuals using homeless services consistently or intermittently over long periods of time, and those unable or resistant to accessing homeless services and who may then become habitual rough sleepers. These individuals often have complex high support needs such as mental or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnosis (the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction).   </p>  <p>  The cost of increasing the targets for Housing First would be dependent on the numbers of individuals requiring these supports, the level of support required and where the individuals are located. In this regard, it is important to note that the majority of individuals and families in emergency accommodation do not require the level of supports provided by Housing First. In terms of the costs of funding such an expansion of the Housing First programme my Department does not hold that specific data. </p></reply>

The current PPP Programme will deliver 1,500 social housing units, spread across three bundles of sites.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo;-based PPP model. Under this type of contract, the PPP project company, as the private partner, designs, builds, finances, maintains and operates (DBFMO) social housing developments for a period of 25 years in return for a monthly payment (unitary charge) from the State. Payment is made by the State only once construction of the buildings is complete and the homes are ready for tenanting. This funding mechanism means that PPPs typically require no upfront capital from the State, so the private partner takes on the full construction and funding risks. PPP's also provide cost certainty for the State, with unitary charge commitments known before the contract is executed. In addition, projects are subject to comprehensive value for money testing in accordance with guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Land provided by the local authority is made available by way of a licence, but remains in State  ownership throughout. In addition, handback provisions are a key feature of PPPs, with the private partner required to hand back the assets to the State at the end of the 25 year operating period, in a specified condition with a pre-defined residual life. This ensures the assets are handed back in good quality for future use.</p>  <p>  In terms of progress to date, in 2021 construction was completed on Bundles 1 and 2 of the Social Housing PPP Programme and the new homes are now fully tenanted. Bundle 1 delivered 534 houses and apartments across six sites in Dublin, Kildare, Louth and Wicklow in 2020 and 2021. Bundle 2 delivered 465 homes in 2021 across eight sites in Cork, Clare, Galway, Kildare, Roscommon and Waterford. Bundle 3 will deliver in the region of 486 new homes across six sites in Dublin, Kildare, Sligo and Wicklow and a number of the sites have commenced the statutory planning process.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment under Housing for All, and given the successful delivery of almost 1,000 homes to date under the Programme, my Department will increase the use of PPP's to deliver social housing. My Department is actively working with relevant stakeholders including the National Development Finance Agency, the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office, and relevant local authorities on the development of further bundles. On foot of a call in January this year, asking local authorities to submit proposals for suitable sites to include in the new PPP programme, selection of sites for the new bundles is progressing well.</p></reply>

The local authority does not have a role in the tenancy.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region only.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, my Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to local authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness. We do need to decrease our reliance on subsidies but we will only do that through significantly scaling up our social housing supply. Housing for all sets us on a pathway to delivering 90,000 social homes between now and the end of 2030.</p></reply>

In preparing these plans local authorities were asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) tool and plan their provision accordingly. Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare Affordable Delivery Action Plans and were set five-year Affordable Delivery Targets.</p>  <p>  An identified high level of affordable housing need arises where the HNDA indicates that, of the total projected need for housing in the county, over 5% of new households will not qualify for social housing but will also be constrained in accessing housing by their ability to afford to buy or rent. The level of affordably constrained need across the county of Longford is assessed at below 5%, although some localised affordability issues may arise in certain towns within the county.</p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the local authority to consider whether a particular requirement for affordable housing arises and whether it will bring forward specific affordable schemes to meet this need. It is possible for local authorities, including Longford County Council, to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether a need for Government funded affordable housing schemes is evident in specific towns/areas. Affordable Housing Fund subsidy is only available to support affordable housing purchase in schemes located in large or key towns to uphold National Planning Framework objectives and to  ensure that provision is aligned with where need is concentrated. This Department and the Housing Agency are available to assist in this regard.</p>  <p>  Where particular challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, and where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply, there is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high. A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. This measure, targeted at first time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. This Scheme will be available nationwide.</p></reply>

The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates.</p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options.</p>  <p>  Under the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme, providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property.</p>  <p>  Some local authorities have introduced locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property. Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests. Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p>  <p>  Section 15 of the Local Government Rates and Other Matter Act 2019 allows a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.

In making decisions on a planning application, a planning authority, or the Board as appropriate, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan including any zoning objectives, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p>  <p>  While the Department is satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning applications for solar farm developments, the matter is being kept under review. Where the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms is identified, my Department will develop such guidance as appropriate.</p></reply>

The local government sector is embarking on a significant expansion of activities across a range of areas including Active Travel and Town Centre First, both of which are Programme for Government commitments and depend on a level of local authority input to deliver.</p>  <p>  Where a new programme initiative is proposed that requires implementation at local authority level, the initiative will be brought by the relevant Department to the County and City Managers Association (CCMA) for discussion and agreement particularly with regard to the number, grade and funding of staff required to deliver the programme.</p>  <p>  In the case of Active Travel which was brought before the CCMA, the National Transport Authority developed a categorisation system with indicative staffing resource requirements across all local authorities as well as increases in dedicated active travel resources within the Regional Design Offices. The NTA identified the appropriate analogous grades to deliver the significantly increased programme of active travel infrastructure and the local authorities are resourcing the programme as required.</p>  <p>  The Town Centre First policy which was launched in February provides a co-ordinated, whole-of-government policy framework to proactively address the decline in the health of towns across Ireland and support measures to regenerate and revitalise them. Under the policy it is proposed to appoint a Town Regeneration Officer (TROs) in local authorities to support the implementation of Town Centre First and work with local Town Teams drawn from the local community. The Department of Rural and Community Development who is funding these posts is currently finalising the job specification and requirements with the CCMA with a view to enabling recruitment of TROs in the coming months.</p></reply>

Both Heritage Ireland 2030, the new national heritage plan, and A Living Tradition, the new vernacular architectural heritage strategy, contain actions to address the issue of insurance of protected structures, including thatched buildings.</p>  <p>  Action 6 of A Living Tradition is to &lsquo;enhance the protection and conservation of historic thatched roofs&rsquo; and is engaging with this matter and work is currently underway to establish the facts of the situation: which companies are prepared to provide insurance; the affordability of such premiums; and, the terms and conditions of such policies for owners. Through dialogue with the insurance sector, it will seek to understand what providers perceive as the issues in insuring such buildings. The study will also gather statistical evidence on the perceived risks associated with thatched buildings, as well examining models in other jurisdictions, so as to engage constructively with the sector in an informed way. The views of owners will also be sought, as well as those of the Central Bank, which is responsible for the prudential supervision of such undertakings authorised in Ireland, and other relevant bodies.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently establishing a thatch steering group to oversee this study. The steering group being established will be called the Built Vernacular Heritage (Thatch) Steering Group. The remit of the steering group is to assist with implementation of the strategy. Its first priority is to work to resolve the urgent issue of affordability and availability of insurance for thatched buildings. It will also examine other relevant issues, including thatching standards, fire prevention guidance, and the availability of suitable thatching materials. The steering group will work to accelerate the recording and protection of thatched buildings, and establish a central database of such structures. It will also progress relevant parts of other actions of the strategy as they relate to thatch and thatching.</p>  <p>  The range of stakeholders comprising the steering group includes a thatch owner (Edward Frampton), a thatcher/owner (Jimmy Lenehan), a representative of the local authority architectural conservation officers (Rose Ryall, Waterford City and County Council), a representative of the local authority heritage officers (Joe Gallagher, Donegal County Council), a representative of the Department&rsquo;s thatching grants section (Patricia Rogers), a representative of the Heritage Council (Colm Murray), and a representative of the Department for Communities (Northern Ireland) (Caroline Maguire).

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.</p><p>In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works.

All other elements are also based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the 80:20 local retention model, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amount to &euro;523.9m. These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3m. Detailed information on the individual LPT allocations including a breakdown of the baselines by local authority, is published by my Department on an annual basis and is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/ea27d-local-property-tax-allocations/</p><p>Revenue publishes a comprehensive range of quarterly and annual statistics relating to LPT on its website, including detailed information regarding Local Authority collection and compliance data, at the following link: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/local-property-tax/index.aspx</i>.</p><p>The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles. It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when new yield per local authority is fully quantified; final figures are not yet available. </p><p>Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final LPT figures to inform that, I do not expect that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process. Each local authority situation is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect. Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation. My Department will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023. LPT allocations for 2023 have, therefore, yet to be decided.</p></reply>

The study will help my Department with developing policy solutions such as for the estate in the details supplied, that due to distance, are not viable to connect to the public network. This is by considering sustainable treatment technologies either on the same site or another suitable alternative site. I understand the study is expected to be completed shortly. </p>  <p>  It will take a number of funding programmes to fully resolve estates with developer provided water services infrastructure, however, my Department is committed to progressing the taking in charge of these legacy estates through increased funding over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Act provides that a &lsquo;public road&rsquo; has the same meaning as the Roads Act 1993, which defines it as &ldquo;a road over which a public right of way exists and the responsibility for the maintenance of which lies on a road authority&rdquo;. A person applying for a licence must provide the planning authority with such plans and other information concerning the position, design and capacity of the appliance, apparatus or structure as the authority may require. A licence may be granted by the planning authority for such period and upon such conditions as may be specified, including conditions in relation to location, design, space taken up by appliance and the need to protect protected structures etc. Within the statutory framework, licensing is a matter for each individual local authority and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter.  </p>  <p>  In considering an application for a licence under section 254(5) of the Act, a planning authority shall have regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, development plans, the number and location of existing appliances and the convenience and safety of road users including pedestrians. </p>  <p>  Section 254(5A) of the Act outlines the licensing process in respect of an application for a licence to erect, construct, place or maintain overground electronic communication infrastructure and any associated physical infrastructure, including telecommunication poles. If a planning authority fails to make a decision within a period of 4 months commencing on the date of receipt of an application, a decision of the planning authority to grant a licence shall be deemed to have been made on the day following the expiration of that period of 4 months. Where a planning authority requests additional information from the applicant and has not made a decision within a period of 4 months of receiving the applicant&rsquo;s response to the request, a deemed decision to grant a licence shall be deemed to have been made. A deemed decision to grant a licence shall be subject to the condition that the network operator concerned, in advance of commencement of the works, shall inform the planning authority concerned and the National Roads Authority or road authority where applicable.</p>  <p>  Under section 254(6) any person may, in relation to the granting, refusing, withdrawing or continuing of a licence under this section or to the conditions specified by the planning authority for such a licence, appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned, except in very specific circumstances, which do not apply in this case. </p></reply>

Glendalough Valley, County Wicklow.</p><p>No application was received in respect of the Historic City of Dublin, in effect removing itself from consideration for the tentative list.</p><p>I established an independent Expert Advisory Group (EAG) to evaluate each of the applications received based on their ability to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), integrity, authenticity, long-term protection and management frameworks, and evidence of local stakeholder support - all critical components of a future nomination dossier. </p><p>I intend to make an announcement on the composition of a new Tentative List for Ireland in July.  Only those sites whose applications clearly demonstrate potential OUV will be included on the new Tentative List. </p><p>It is envisaged that Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List process will be reopened for review within the next five years to allow my Department assess other sites that may be proposed and which may demonstrate OUV. This may include sites on the 2010 Tentative List for which applications were not submitted under the current Tentative List review. </p></reply>

The provisions for the discharge of the products of combustion to the outside air via chimneys or flues and the associated ventilation requirements for a range of heat producing appliances, and fuel types, are given in Sections 1, 2, 3 &amp;amp; 4 of TGD J. </p>  <p>  When no heat producing appliance is being installed in the dwelling house, there is no mandatory requirement to construct a chimney or flue, however, the provision of a chimney in a dwelling house, where none is required, is not precluded by the Building Regulations. </p>  <p>  There are no proposals to amend Part J to obligate building owners to install chimneys or flues in new houses.</p>  <p>  Part L sets the energy and carbon performance for dwellings and is performance based. It is a matter for the specifier/designer to specify the heating system to achieve compliance with Part L.</p>  <p>   The Nearly Zero Energy Buildings requirements of the building regulations make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. The Central Statistics Office analysis of Building Energy Rating data demonstrates this shift away from fossil fuels; oil boilers are no longer installed in new dwellings, and heat pumps make up 80% of heating systems in new dwellings with this percentage growing steadily each year.

The resulting comprehensive report of the advisory group was developed during 2020 and published bilingually in January 2021. This report which includes the results and findings from a series of stakeholder consultations undertaken by the advisory group was subject to a wider public consultation from February to Jul 2021. </p>  <p>  Informed by the experts' advice and recommendations, and by detailed feedback from over 2,300 submissions received from the public consultation, my Department now intends to commence work on the necessary legislation for an expanded network of MPAs. Work on the General Scheme of an MPA Bill will continue into the autumn of 2022, with the aim of enacting the legislation in 2023.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.1718.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400084#WRY01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566, 632, 651, 708 and 828 together.</p><p>The current processing times for passports are outlined below:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 25 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (for applications received from 6 June)</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Post Passport&quot; service</p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within these turnaround times. Turnaround time applies to fully complete and correct applications, and begins from the date that supporting documents are received by the Passport Service, not the date the online application is made. Applications that are incorrect or incomplete will take longer to process. Since March of this year, the Passport Service has been operating a new document management system whereby incomplete applications that require further supporting documents are prioritised once the additional documents are received by the Passport Service. These applications are then processed within 15 working days. </p><p>An application is current in the Passport Service system for a period of 6 months from when the online application is made. From the time that the supporting documents are received, the Passport Service works with the applicant to process the application and ensure all required documents have been submitted to prove the applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship, to verify their identity, and in the cases of children, to ensure that consent of guardians is verified. In a small number of cases, it can happen that all required supporting documents are not received by the Passport Service during the 6 month validity period. In such cases, the application will expire and a refund will issue to the applicant. </p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. The Passport Service continues to outperform its previous busiest year (2019) by almost 20%. Over 600,000 passports have issued to date this year. This is 83,000 more than the number of passports issued during the same period in 2019. </p><p>Diplomatic passport applications are usually processed within 10 working days of receipt of supporting documents. 10 working days is the standard turnaround time for adult renewal applications. Diplomatic passport applications are similar to simple adult renewal applications in that the applicant must hold a current valid Irish passport or have an application for passport renewal in the Passport Service system. </p><p>The Passport Service has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers an opportunity to give feedback on the quality of the service they receive. </p><p>The Passport Service is committed to providing a high quality, effective service to all of our customers and welcomes feedback on how the service can be improved. All feedback is dealt with in confidence and in an impartial manner. </p><p>Customers can submit a complaint in writing to: Passport Complaints, Knockmaun House, 42-47, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, D02 TN83.</p><p>The Passport Service aims to resolve complaints as promptly as possible. Each complaint is examined upon receipt and acknowledged. The complaint will then be investigated and a response issued in writing.</p><p>If customers remain unhappy with the response, they can refer their complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>Further details of the Passport Service complaints procedure can be found on the DFA website - <i>www.dfa.ie/about-us/our-commitments/passport-complaints-and-appeals/</i>.</p><p>The Passport Service has reminded staff on the Oireachtas phone line to advise representatives of the postal address for submitting complaints, if requested. </p><p>My department provides a Wellbeing at Work programme and runs a schedule of bi-weekly events, both online and in person, to improve the health, safety and wellbeing of colleagues and to support them in achieving their potential. This Programme consists of the following pillars; Mental, Physical, Social and Environmental. Recent events include a talk on 'Positive Mental Health', Meditation for Wellness classes, Staff Relay Series and &lsquo;Thriving in the Age of Digital Distraction&rsquo;. </p><p>The Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS) provides an internal employee assistance programme to all Civil Service staff and is designed to assist employees to manage work-related and personal difficulties. It is a free and confidential service providing support to staff and promotes employee wellness and organisational effectiveness. </p><p>The Passport Service recognises its staff as a valuable resource and my Department aims to maintain a resilient workforce by promoting positive wellbeing in the workplace. There has been an ongoing recruitment drive in the Passport Service over the past several months to ensure resourcing needs are fully met. Most recently the Passport Service held a Temporary Clerical Officer competition with a view to doubling staffing numbers since June of last year. To date the Passport Service has taken on over 400 new staff since June 2021. There are currently 762 staff in the Passport Service. </p><p>In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the processing of passports requires physical attendance on-site. Passport Service staff who are processing applications or in customer service roles cannot work from home. The overwhelming majority of Passport Service staff work on-site every day. Staff who are not involved in the processing of applications, and who are eligible to work from home, (approx 2%) can do so for up to 50% of working time over a four week period, with anchor days built in, while also retaining flexibility for in person attendance required for meetings, training, key events and other priorities. </p><p>The information requested by Deputy Richmond is outlined below in tabular form.</p><p><b>Staff assigned to the Passport Service </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of Passport Service staff in month of May </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>456 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>519 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>565 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>574 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>646 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>646 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>454 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Processing time for fully complete and correct applications begins from the date supporting documents are received by the Passport Service. At the time this application was received, the processing time for first time applications was 40 working days. In this specific application, the Passport Service requested additional supporting documents for the applicant which also increased the processing time. The passport was issued to the applicant on 2 June 2022. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 517,000 passports by 14 June. In the same period this year, over 600,000 passports have been issued. Last year, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five and a half months, the Passport Service has issued 95% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.</p>  <p>  Since March, online processing times for first time applications have been reduced by 40% and these applications now take 25 working days rather than 40 days, as of Monday, 6 June. This is a direct result of the substantial level of investment that the Department has made in the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been proactively planning for the significant increase in demand for many months and has made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.</p>  <p>  It is currently not possible for the Passport Service to address issues with applications earlier in the process due to the volume of applications that are being received. Applications enter a queue and are checked in order of date received.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service operates an award-winning online service, which compares favourably internationally with countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. There is an ongoing programme of reform in the Passport Service, which continues to look at ways to enhance the customer experience for citizens.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that Passport Service operations are meeting the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements are allowing the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. </p></reply>

I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding the situation on the ground, and we have expressed our views clearly in relation to illegal settlement activity, settler violence, violations of international law and any action that threatens the viability of a two-State solution. We have done this proactively as a member of the EU, at the UN Security Council, and bilaterally with Israel, and we will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory on five occasions as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also meet regularly with other key partners in the region, most recently on 2 June when I travelled to Jordan and met with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. We discussed the situation on the ground in the region, in particular our shared concerns about the situation in Jerusalem. </p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland, as a member of the Security Council and the EU, remains a credible and effective actor in international fora in respect of our views on the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli Government. To promote progress on these issues, and to use our position and influence within the EU and the UN effectively, we engage actively in dialogue and seek to build consensus among our partners in these fora.</p>  <p>  As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 246 of 19 May 2022, it remains the case that there is no consensus among EU Member States or at the Security Council for the introduction of sanctions against Israel.</p>  <p>  However, Ireland consistently uses its voice to push for action at EU and UN levels, including in relation to differentiation between illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and the State of Israel. Ireland&rsquo;s advocacy in this regard has resulted in the implementation of a number of practical EU measures, including guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods (so that consumers can identify them and make their own choices in this matter), and exclusion of settlement institutions from EU research funding.</p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly committed to a two-State solution, and will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties.</p></reply>

FBR staff also continue to provide support to Passport Services due to current unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p>  <p>  A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 375 since June 2021. The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021. It is anticipated that some of these resources will be allocated to the provision of FBR Services as the current high level of passport demand reduces.</p>  <p>  There are currently 38,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications on hand with the Passport Service. To date this year, almost 5,500 Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed.</p>  <p>  Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time.</p>  <p>  FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

The obligation to freeze assets under the above sanctions regime - also known as the Ukraine (Territorial Integrity) Sanctions Regime - must therefore be complied with by whomever holds the assets at the time their owner is added to the sanctions list. In practice, this typically means that funds are to be frozen by financial institutions.</p>  <p>  Irish financial institutions report details of funds frozen under EU sanctions to the Central Bank of Ireland. These details are in turn notified to the European Commission by the Department of Foreign Affairs on a regular basis, through a dedicated reporting portal. The total value of funds frozen by Irish financial institutions under the Ukraine (Territorial Integrity) Sanctions Regime up to 10 June 2022 is EUR 1.67 billion. Specific details of accountholders and owners of funds cannot be published, for reasons of confidentiality.</p>  <p>  The sanctions adopted by the EU in response to the war in Ukraine are unprecedented, but are only effective insofar as they are properly implemented. In its capacity as a competent authority for financial sanctions, the Central Bank of Ireland maintains regular engagement with financial institutions on their obligations. Regular outreach to relevant private operators is also undertaken by the Department of Finance. The Cross Departmental International Sanctions Committee, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, has also been involved in outreach to private sector operators.</p>  <p>  Other than through its regular reporting to the European Commission as outlined above, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not compiled an inventory of Russian assets held in the State. The Department is not currently aware of any assets owned or controlled by an individual or entity listed under the Ukraine (Territorial Integrity) Sanctions Regime that have not been frozen by the relevant body.</p></reply>

The methodology used to calculate climate finance changed in 2021, following the coming into force of the EU Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action This new methodology was applied to reporting on climate expenditure in 2020, compiled during 2021, and which is detailed in the 2020 Climate Finance Report.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance in 2019 was &euro;93.6 million. According to the previous methodology, Ireland&rsquo;s total climate finance would be &euro;91.8 million in 2020, representing a 2% decrease in climate finance from 2019. In applying the new methodology, Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance is approximately &euro;88.3 million.  2020 was also an exceptional year due to the impact of COVID-19 on programming and the delivery of planned activities.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to significantly increasing its climate finance, in response to the urgent needs of many developing countries. The Programme for Government tasked my Department with devising a strategy to scale up Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance contributions. At COP26 in 2021, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland will more than double its international climate finance, reaching at least &euro;225 million per year by 2025. Work on the strategy outlining how this target will be met is nearing completion.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of FBR staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The applications referenced were registered on 14 July 2020, and are being stored in a secure environment. In order for the applicants&rsquo; address details to be updated, original proof of address such as a utility bill must be provided. This should be forwarded, with FBR application numbers included for reference, to the FBR team at the following address: Foreign Births Registration, PO Box 13003, Balbriggan, Co. Dublin. </p>  <p>  FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

To date, the Security Council has met 21 times to consider the matter, including on 19 April when I personally briefed them on my visit to Ukraine earlier that month. </p><p>Ireland co-sponsored the UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution condemning Russia for its illegal, unjustified and unprovoked attack against Ukraine, which was adopted on 2 March (141 votes to 5, with 35 abstentions); the UNGA Ukraine humanitarian resolution, which was adopted on 24 March (140 votes to 5, with 38 abstentions); and the UNGA Resolution to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, which was adopted on 7 April (93 votes to 24, with 58 abstentions).</p><p>We are also active across the full multilateral system in ensuring that Russia remains isolated, including at the Council of Europe, where we worked with the EU and likeminded countries to expel Russia on 16 March.  </p><p>Ireland joined over 40 States in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court. Ireland will provide a further &euro;3 million in funding to the ICC, which will assist with regard to all situations before the court, including Ukraine.  </p><p>We also welcomed the establishment by the UN Human Rights Council of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. It is important that different accountability mechanisms in Ukraine can cooperate, within their respective mandates.  </p><p>The most effective way to isolate Russia and Belarus, is by acting in coordination with our EU and international partners.  To this end, on 21 March EU Foreign Ministers agreed common guiding principles for engagement with Russia and Belarus in multilateral fora.  </p><p>These commit to:</p><p>-  Following up on measures already taken or under consideration on suspension of Russia and Belarus&rsquo; rights of participation in international organisations and bodies and regional cooperation frameworks;</p><p>-  Examining further possible similar measures across the multilateral system;</p><p>-  Actively opposing the election of Russia and Belarus or Russian and Belarusian candidates;</p><p>-  Acting to suspend upcoming chairmanships of working parties in international fora; Advocating against appointments of candidates to leadership positions;</p><p>-  Acting to prevent Russia and Belarus from hosting international conferences, meetings, and events under UN or other multilateral instances. </p><p>Ireland engaged fully in the development of these guiding principles and has been working with our fellow EU member states to apply them on a case by case basis.  </p><p>The EU approach acknowledges that taking forward specific actions requires a proper assessment of the legal possibilities in the context of the relevant procedural rules for each organisation concerned. EU coordination takes place at local level to determine the best course of action for each international body or meeting. </p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a lead role when it comes to the international relations of the State but this is without prejudice to the specific responsibilities which other Departments, public bodies and organisations have with respect to the international bodies in which they participate.

That decision, unprecedented in the Council&rsquo;s 73-year history, reflected the strongest possible condemnation of the Russian Federation&rsquo;s unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, another Council of Europe member, and the Kremlin&rsquo;s disavowal of the values, principles, and legal obligations which membership of the Council entails.</p>  <p>  On 28 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) presented a number of additional recommendations on accountability, detailed in Resolution 2436 (2022) and referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions. </p>  <p>  The Committee of Ministers is reviewing these in consultation with the European Committee on Crime Problems, the Steering Committee on Human Rights, and the Committee of Legal Advisers on Public International Law. As President, we will await the opinions of these expert bodies and deliberation within the Committee of Ministers before determining a formal response. However, drawing on my engagement with the PACE Standing Committee in Dublin on 31 May, I will note some relevant considerations regarding the proposals cited by the Deputy.     </p>  <p>  Ireland remains a steadfast supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We were amongst the first states to refer the situation in Ukraine to the ICC in March and, following my visit to Ukraine in April, I announced &euro;3 million in funding to support the ICC in the exercise of its jurisdiction there. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, this jurisdiction extends to investigation over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but not to the crime of aggression. Recognising this, I am sympathetic to proposals for the creation of an ad hoc tribunal for that purpose. However, I am also conscious that there are a number of significant legal and practical questions concerning the establishment and operation of such a tribunal that need to be resolved before it represents a credible option.</p>  <p>  While exploring these with relevant authorities, my priority, as President of the Committee of Ministers, is to ensure that the Council of Europe does all it can here and now, through its existing instruments, to support Ukraine and ensure accountability for the crimes committed there.</p>  <p>  To this end, I am firmly committed to advancing the Council&rsquo;s revised Action Plan for Ukraine, as endorsed last month by the Government in Kyiv. As President, Ireland will strive to ensure its full implementation, including by way of an additional voluntary contribution of &euro;200,000. </p>  <p>  The European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights are, of course, the cornerstones of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s accountability framework. Under the terms of its expulsion, Russia will remain accountable for violations of the European Convention on Human Rights committed up to 16 September 2022.  </p>  <p>  A contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights may refer any alleged violation of the Convention or its Protocols by another party to the European Court of Human Rights. The vast majority of inter-state cases before the Court arise from regional conflicts between contracting parties. </p>  <p>  Ukraine has already initiated an inter-state case against Russia relating to violations of the Convention arising from the invasion. Ukraine is, of course, is best placed to put evidence before the Court as to the impact of the invasion on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. Ireland is supportive of Ukraine in these ongoing proceedings. We have also encouraged the Council Secretariat in its provision of expert advice to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in documenting violations of the Convention. Already, in March, the European Court of Human Rights indicated a number of interim measures requiring Russia to refrain from military attacks against civilians. Further findings are expected. </p>  <p>  I am determined to use Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to protect human rights in Ukraine and across the European continent. Beyond that, in Strasbourg, as in Geneva, New York, Brussels and the Hague, Ireland will continue to advocate tirelessly for effective measures to discourage violence and strengthen the prospects for peace, while ensuring accountability for its violation.   </p></reply>

Ireland does not have any unilateral sanctions regimes, and the Government has no plans in this regard. In common with all EU Member States, we play an active role in the development and adoption of EU sanctions. As a current member of the UN Security Council, we also participate in the Security Council's 14 sanctions committees.</p>  <p>  Sanctions are most effective when applied in a unified and coordinated manner across multiple jurisdictions. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has adopted a wide range of sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus, as part of a coordinated international response involving the US, the UK, Canada and others. These are the most extensive sanctions ever adopted by the EU, and their impact is magnified by the fact that they are being developed and introduced in cooperation with like-minded partners.</p>  <p>  There have been calls to confiscate assets frozen under Ukraine-related sanctions, and to potentially use these assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In March, the European Commission established a 'Freeze and Seize' Task Force to ensure coordinated and effective implementation of asset freezes imposed on Russian and Belarusian individuals and entities in the context of the Ukraine war. Three sub-groups of the Task Force have been created to focus on specific issues: the first on identifying and freezing sanctioned assets and reporting on these freezes; the second on investigations into links between criminal offences and sanctions, investigations into beneficial ownership, and confiscation of assets; and the third on the creation of a common European fund to reconstruct Ukraine using confiscated assets.</p>  <p>  Ireland is participating actively in the work of the Task Force and its sub-groups, which have collectively met a total of 18 times to date.  Discussions so far suggest that assets may only be confiscated in circumstances where a crime has been committed. Further work is required to ensure a robust and clear legal basis for confiscations linked to sanctions breaches. The Department of Justice is taking a lead role on these issues.</p></reply>

These applications include:</p><p>- All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity</p><p>- First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form</p><p>- First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)</p><p>The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.</p><p>In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.</p><p>It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.</p><p>In a small number of cases, the Passport Service contacts the Garda station and is informed that the witness was not recorded in the logbook. Prior to last week, this resulted in the Passport Service requesting a new witnessed consent or identity form from the applicant. </p><p>Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with senior management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the relevant Garda station cannot be contacted after three attempts, or where the Passport Service is informed that the witnessing was not recorded in the logbook. </p><p>Details on these applications are now forwarded by the Passport Service to Garda HQ on a daily basis. The Garda Liaison Officer will then undertake to verify the details. </p><p>This new system, which commenced last week, will assist in reducing the number of passport applications that are delayed due to a failure to make contact with AGS to verify witness details.</p><p>The Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.</p><p>The Passport Service has published a full-page informational advertisement in the June edition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that the details must be recorded in the Garda log book and that the Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent and identity form details.</p><p>The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p><p>With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputy enquired, the Passport Service made contact with the relevant Garda station and was informed that the witness details were not recorded in the log book. The Passport Service followed standard procedure at that time and requested new consent forms for each applicant from the applicants' parent.</p></reply>

For study visas, the indicative processing time is eight weeks. However, the processing time for visas at each location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.</p></reply>

Our focus remains on responding to the conflict, in particular through efforts to ease the plight of the Ukrainian people and to hold the Russian leadership to account.

This application is indicative of the wider change in the security situation across Europe. It is the clear right of every sovereign and independent State to choose their own foreign policy and to ensure the security and defence of their territories. I assured Minister Haavisto that Ireland supports Finland in making those choices. </p><p>Ireland and Finland are both committed to a well-functioning system of multilateralism and are committed UN member states. During our meeting we also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s current membership of the UN Security Council and the importance of the rules based international order. </p><p>We also had the opportunity to discuss in more detail the EU-UK relationship and the current situation in respect of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, how we support the Commission in continuing to seek dialogue with the UK and we encourage the UK to respond with a similar approach. </p><p>Ireland and Finland are this year celebrating 60 years of Diplomatic Relations and this meeting was an opportunity to mark that anniversary in person, and to commit to ongoing strong and positive relations between our countries, including as Ireland implements the Nordic Strategy which was published on 1 June 2021. It was also an opportunity to thank Minister Haavisto in person for the assistance provided by Finland to Ireland during the evacuation from Afghanistan in late summer 2021. </p><p>In addition to my meeting with Minister Haavisto, while in Helsinki I also met with the Minister of Defence of Finland, Antti Kaikkonen and visited the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. </p></reply>

My Department reports annually to Government on implementation of the strategy, with the reports for 2020 and 2021 available on www.gov.ie.  The 2021 progress report was brought to Government last month to mark Africa Day.</p>  <p>  The 2021 report shows that Ireland&rsquo;s trade in goods with Africa increased to a record level of &euro;2.42 billion, while trade in services reached all time high of just over &euro;4 billion.  The Africa Ireland Economic Forum, which my Department has convened for 30 June 2022, will help add further momentum to these trade and investment flows.</p>  <p>  Diplomatic links are being strengthened.  In 2020, Ireland became a member of the African Development Bank, opening trade and investment opportunities to Irish companies. Following the opening of an Embassy in Morocco in 2021, the Government has decided also to open an Embassy in Senegal.  Also last year, Ireland was accepted as an associate member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, deepening our links with Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa and around the world.</p>  <p>  Political contacts are strong. The Taoiseach participated in the EU-Africa Summit last February, chairing a roundtable on agriculture.  Last year, Minister Coveney visited Kenya and Somalia for high level political meetings.  Also in 2021, I participated in the African Union - EU Foreign Affairs Ministerial in Kigali, Rwanda, where I had bilateral meetings with Ministers from a number of African countries.  I also visited Irish Aid projects in Rwanda and Uganda, where I also met with the Foreign Minister.  Earlier this year, I was in Pretoria to co-chair with my South African counterpart the Joint Commission on Cooperation between our two countries.  Last month, I saw the work of the Irish Aid programme in Mozambique, and co-chaired the annual political dialogue with Mozambique.  </p>  <p>  As an elected member of the UN Security Council Ireland is playing a leadership role in contributing to peace and security in Africa. Ireland is working closely with African partners on key Security Council matters including through our role as co-penholder on the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel and co-chair of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security. Ireland has also been at the forefront of efforts to address the conflict in Ethiopia at the Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland took on a leadership role in responding to the COVID pandemic with African partners, building on decades of support for strengthening health systems in Africa. In Budget 2022, the Government increased the allocation to international development assistance to over &euro;1 billion for 2022. This will allow for sustained investment in development across Africa, as well as an effective Irish response to growing humanitarian needs caused by conflict and climate change, as well the emerging food crisis which is a the consequences of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p></reply>

The Congressional Delegation met with President Higgins, Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin, myself and other political representatives for discussions on Northern Ireland, Brexit, the future of Europe and the transatlantic relationship, as well as the deep and enduring ties between Ireland and the United States of America. </p>  <p>  The delegation also visited Kerry, where they were accompanied by Minister Norma Foley. They visited the Blasket Islands and the newly renovated Blasket Islands interpretive centre where they met local political figures, school groups and representatives of local businesses.  </p>  <p>  This bipartisan Congressional delegation, the first to visit Ireland since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, follows a period of active Irish Government engagement with the US Administration in recent months. The importance of the return to in-person visits cannot be overstated. Our deep, historical people-to-people connections form the foundation upon which Ireland&rsquo;s strong relationship with the United States is built. </p>  <p>  Engagement by successive US Administrations, Congress, and the Irish diaspora has been an indispensable part of the peace process over the last three decades. Congressman Neal and the other members of the delegation were unwavering in their support for peace in Northern Ireland, and emphasised their view that Brexit should not impact on the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  It was heartening to see a strong bipartisan recognition of the importance of the Ireland-US relationship reflected in the membership and engagement of this Congressional delegation, as well as the keen interest on Capitol Hill in the implications of Brexit for the island of Ireland, North and South. We will continue to ensure that the Irish perspective is understood through ongoing high-level contacts, and through the ongoing engagement of our Embassy in Washington D.C.</p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council has convened six times since the beginning of Russia&rsquo;s current military offensive and our most recent discussion assessed the effectiveness of the different strands of the EU response. We discussed the preparation of the sixth package of sanctions aimed at depriving Russia and Belarus of the ability to wage war on Ukraine. This package was later adopted on 3 June and includes a prohibition on imports of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products by sea, on a phased basis. </p><p>The Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Canada joined EU Foreign Ministers for a discussion on the ongoing coordination of supports. I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for Ukraine, including its EU membership aspirations.</p><p>We are aware of the impact this conflict is having on other regions. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Council also considered the EU's relations with the Western Balkans, and possible supports that the EU can provide. Six Foreign Ministers from the Western Balkans joined the Council for a discussion, which provided an opportunity to reinforce the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the region, and to discuss the European ambitions of each country and set out the expectations of the EU.</p><p>EU High Representative Josep Borrell also provided an update on efforts to address the delay in the delivery of EU financial assistance for 2021 to the Palestinian Authority. I highlighted the urgent need for the European Commission to work constructively towards finding a solution that would allow for the immediate disbursement of funds, without any conditionality.</p><p>I also raised the dire humanitarian situation in Ethiopia and called for a detailed discussion on the role the EU can play on the key issues of humanitarian access, cessation of hostilities and accountability.  A full discussion on the situation in the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, is now scheduled to take place at the next meeting of the Council, on 20 June. </p></reply>

The Fund has supported over 3,000 projects with more than &euro;60 million in grant funding since its establishment.  </p><p>In spring 2021, Minister Coveney approved a new strategy for the Reconciliation Fund for the period 2021-2024, to ensure that the Fund remains relevant, effective, and efficient over the coming years, particularly given the difficult contexts of Brexit and COVID-19. </p><p>The Reconciliation Fund strategy emphasises the aim of the Fund to work with all sections of society towards a shared vision of a cohesive, inclusive and reconciled Northern Ireland. To achieve this goal, the Fund supports a wide range of organisations and activities that promote reconciliation, with grants varying in size from just hundreds of euros to small groups, up to amounts in the hundreds of thousands for a small number of larger partners.</p><p>There are 2 open calls for applications to the Fund annually, usually in the spring and autumn. These open calls are advertised on the Department of Foreign Affairs website, specifically on the Reconciliation Fund homepage (), as well as on social media, with detailed information provided on how prospective applicants may apply.  </p><p>In order to ensure that maximum benefit is achieved with available financial resources, applications undergo rigorous assessment and appraisal, including consideration by an Interdepartmental Consultative Committee. This Committee is comprised of representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Department of Education and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>The assessment and appraisal process is designed to ensure that those projects with greatest potential impact and strongest alignment to the criteria and priorities of the Fund, as laid out in the strategy, are supported. </p><p>Applications are also evaluated on additional factors including:</p><p>- Geographical location</p><p>- Value for money </p><p>- Applicants' organisational governance arrangements, sustainability and financial management capacity</p><p>- Funding environment for a particular sector</p><p>Furthermore, a Tax Clearance Certificate is required for grants in excess of &euro;10,000 and recipients of grant aid in excess of &euro;12,500 are required to provide audited accounts on completion of the project, as well as submitting a financial and narrative report. The impact of projects is also assessed through engagement with funded organisations and on-site monitoring visits. </p><p>Information on all awards since 2012 is available under the &lsquo;Previous Grants&rsquo; section of the Reconciliation Fund homepage ().</p><p>Since 2017, the Reconciliation Fund has awarded grant funding to organisations associated with the Orange Order following the processes and procedures as described above.

By the end of last year, nearly 193 million people were experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity, an increase of almost 40 million over the previous record in 2020. </p>  <p>  This situation has continued to worsen in 2022. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, including its effective blockade on shipping from Ukraine's Black Sea ports, has restricted access to wheat and fertilizers.  This has had an upward pressure on global food prices, exacerbating the precarious situation of vulnerable people particularly in countries experiencing ongoing humanitarian crises.  </p>  <p>  The United Nation&rsquo;s outlook for June to September 2022 identified 20 hunger hotspots where lives and livelihoods are at risk and urgent humanitarian action is a priority.  These hotspots, with the exception of Afghanistan and Haiti, are all in Africa and the Middle East. In six of these countries &ndash; Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen &ndash; there is a real and terrifying prospect of starvation and death.</p>  <p>  The United Nations reports that its humanitarian appeals are significantly underfunded, at 18.2% of estimated resource requirement.  That said, the amount of funding given in response to these appeals significantly higher in absolute terms than at this point in previous years.</p>  <p>  There is a collective responsibility to act and Ireland is leading by example. Through our range of experienced and trusted partners, including UN agencies, the Red Cross family and NGOs, the Irish Aid programme is supporting responses across the globe, with a strong focus on the 20 hunger hotspots. The Irish Aid allocation for humanitarian action this year, at &euro;113 million, is substantially higher than last year, and is likely to increase further before year end in response to these emerging needs.  Separately, and to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity, Ireland has pledged to invest &euro;800 million by 2027 in improving global food and nutrition systems.</p>  <p>  As the informal focal point on Conflict and Hunger on the United Nations Security Council, Ireland is consistent advocate for urgent attention and action on global food insecurity. We are also a strong voice at the EU on collective action.</p>  <p>  The Grand Bargain Annual High Level Meeting will take place on 30 June and 1 July in Geneva. This will bring together 64 donor signatories, UN agencies, the Red Cross family and NGOs. While this is not a pledging conference, it is a timely opportunity for key humanitarian actors to discuss and agree on the collective actions necessary to respond to rising global hunger.  Ireland will use this important opportunity to advocate for an urgent, scaled-up response that targets those most in need.</p></reply>

In addition to those affected within the country, millions more Syrians have left the country as refugees, the majority to neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  This is the context within which the wider impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the restriction of grain exports, are reverbating, within Syria and also across its neighbours.  In Syria itself, almost two-thirds of the population are expected to face food shortages in 2022.</p>  <p>  This year, through the Irish Aid programme, the Government will provide over &euro;23 million to the Syria humanitarian response. This will bring Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Syria since 2012 to over &euro;216 million, our largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis. Using a variety of trusted partners, we ensure that critical assistance reaches those most in need. This includes displaced Syrians still within the country as well as refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also addressing the issue of food insecurity directly, notably through funding of &euro;8 million (provided through the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine) to assist the World Food Programme&rsquo;s activities both within Syria and in the neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding at the global level, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). In the last six months, the CERF has provided $25 million in critical assistance to Syria with the largest proportion going to support food security. Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis &ndash; so far this year the European Commission has mobilised &euro;135 million in humanitarian aid to provide vital assistance (including food and nutritional support) to millions of people inside Syria.</p>  <p>  Since joining the Security Council in 2021, Ireland and Norway have served as co-penholders on the Syria humanitarian file. In July 2021, we were pleased to secure Resolution 2585 by consensus, which extended the mandate for the UN&rsquo;s cross border operation at Bab al-Hawa for 12 months.  Ahead of the expiry of that mandate in July, Ireland and Norway are continuing to engage extensively across the Council, making the case that humanitarian aid must continue to reach all people in need.</p></reply>

Each unit's tour of duty normally lasts for about two months on a four days on, two days off rota basis. In addition to basic pay, prison duty allowance is paid to personnel of the Permanent Defence Force below the rank of Commandant engaged on security duties in Portlaoise prison. The current daily Prison Duty allowance is between &euro;84.37 and &euro;86.71 depending on rank. </p>  <p>  Regardless of employment on the Prison Duties, DF personnel are still in receipt of their pay, which is a matter of public record. In addition a Military Service Allowance is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel, and is designed to compensate for the special disadvantages associated with military life. This includes unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger and the restrictions inherent in military discipline.</p>  <p>  There is also a separate on call Portlaoise Hospital Guard Allowance for Enlisted Personnel of &euro;28.12 (weekday) and &euro;56.22 (Sunday and DF Holiday), for escorting prisoners to medical appointments. </p>  <p>  With regards to the number of prisoners in Portlaoise Prison, this is a matter for the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice has advised that prison officers pay is a matter of public record and that allowances are also paid for Additional Hours (AH) and for working anti-social hours and times such as night shifts, Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holiday shifts. These allowances are not generally fixed rates allowances, but are based on a percentage of the officer&rsquo;s hourly pay. Under the Additional Hours system, officers may be contracted to work up to 360 additional hours per annum. Officers serving in Portlaoise Prison would in general, be more experienced and longer serving officers and would therefore be at the top end of the prison officer pay scale.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces, which was published on the 9 February 2022, included a recommendation &ldquo;That an immediate focus be given to standing down a number of current Defence Forces&rsquo; ATCP taskings which no longer seem justified in the current security situation&rdquo;. These recommendations are currently under consideraion by my Department along with in-depth discussion and inter-departmental consultation. The intent is that following relevant consultation, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan.</p></reply>

As of 30 April 2022, the effective female strength of the RDF is 194 members.</p><p>In line with current policies and commitments, a number of initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. For example:</p><p>- Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment within the generalrecruitment framework, including a Female Recruitment Standing Committee reporting on initiatives for 2022, with dedicated female recruitment teams proposed. In addition, a female specific &quot;Always on&quot; (constant targeting of the female demographic) campaign commenced in October 2021. </p><p>- The Defence Forces actively engage with schools to conduct career talks and regularly attendevents aimed at future career choices for schools. </p><p>- A Gender Equality and Diversity Officer has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces are committed to gender equality and employ a gender perspective in the planning and execution of operations both at home and overseas and in all policies and regulations. Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote a gender perspective in operations. </p><p>- A Defence Forces Women's Network was established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. </p><p>Over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence, a number of projects will be progressed to ensure the development and promotion of strategies that continue to support increased female participation in the Defence Forces. </p><p>Initiatives in place to recruit individuals to the Reserve include supports provided to maximise RDF recruitment, including use of social media, promotion through the DF Press Office, outreach activities by RDF members, and the use of PDF exit interviews which contain information on applying to the RDF.  In addition, a number of measures to streamline the recruitment and induction process for the RDF are in train and it is hoped that they will yield a positive outcome.</p><p>The Government remains committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the recently published Report from the Commission on the Defence Forces includes a number of recommendations relating to gender and diversity in the Defence Forces.As the Deputy will appreciate, detailed consideration of all the recommendations is required. This involves significant inter-departmental consultation, and this is continuing.

It is recognised that the principal demand drivers of Defence capital requirements are the ongoing renewal, retention and acquisition of military equipment along with the development and upgrade of Defence Forces built infrastructure. </p><p>The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through a comprehensive Equipment Development Plan which provides a consolidated, structured basis for investment in military equipment to maintain and develop necessary capabilities. Similarly, a Defence Forces Built Infrastructure Programme sets out the requirements for essential infrastructure development works over a medium term timeframe. These strategic frameworks combine to provide the basis for medium term equipment and infrastructural planning and investment requirements for the Defence Forces.</p><p>Capital funding allocations are framed by the annual estimates process and the multi-annual National Development Plan.

The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions across the Defence Forces, however. </p><p>The current public service pay agreement, &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo;, provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. A general round increase in annualised basic salary of 1% or &euro;500, whichever was the greater, came into effect on 1st October 2021. In addition, fixed periodic pensionable allowances, as well as allowances in the nature of pay, were also increased by 1% on this date.</p><p>The current pay agreement also provides for further increases in 2022, namely:</p><p>-  The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1st February 2022 last. </p><p>-  A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1st October 2022. Fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay will also be increased by 1% on this date.</p><p>In addition to general round pay increases arising out of ongoing national pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Force&rsquo;s allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in 2019. </p><p>The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on the 9th February last. The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference, including an examination of the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces.  </p><p>Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations is required.  This involves significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials are currently engaging with key stakeholders to ascertain their views. Following this engagement, I intend to return to Government with a proposed response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan. </p><p>Regarding the specific issue of  doctors in the Medical Corps, I am informed that a strong direct entry pipeline, along with the impending graduation of the first two full-time appointments from the Military Medicine Training Scheme, as well as the availability of others in the scheme on placement, will soon bring the number of Medical Officers in the Defence Forces close to the establishment figure. </p></reply>

There is generally good capacity in schools generally across the country albeit there may be capacity pressures to be managed in some areas.  National enrolments at primary level are reducing (projected to be circa. 25,000 below their 2018 peak in September 2022).  A capacity survey at post-primary level, which has a 100% completion rate, indicates capacity of circa 20,000 school places.  An equivalent survey at primary level is currently underway and engagement with special schools will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  The 16 Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT), hosted by the regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs), to support the needs of children from Ukraine arriving in Ireland will have a key role in managing these capacity pressures. Close liaison and linkages with the HSE and the disability services are key to aligning, in so far as possible, the accommodation, care and education of children with complex special needs.</p>  <p>  Capacity information on the school system will be made available by my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit (PBU) to support and assist the work of the REALT teams.</p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that challenges in terms of capacity could potentially arise if overall numbers are very high and particularly for areas with a high volume of children seeking enrolment in schools. For this reason, my Department has developed several options to assist with contingency planning for provision of education for Ukrainian children.</p>  <p>  In addition to assessment and planning in relation to capacity requirements, my Department has a number of supports in place to meet the needs of students from Ukraine, including language and wellbeing and mental health supports. </p>  <p>  The  Summer 2022 Programme is available to all primary and post-primary schools, for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  The Inclusion Programme offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students such as addressing English language skills and integration, including students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department, in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, has put in place a new process to facilitate the provision of School Transport Scheme Services for children arriving to Ireland from Ukraine.</p></reply>

To establish that the nearest school is full parents/guardians must provide certain documentary evidence including confirmation that an application for enrolment in the nearest school was made within the deadline dates specified by the school and confirmation from the school authorities that the school was full.</p><p>Individual queries may be addressed to School Transport Section of my Department at  school_transport@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385.</p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. </p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act</p>  <p>   When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.  </p>  <p>  Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status.</p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools.</p></reply>

Parental Leave is a period of statutory unpaid leave available to a teacher or SNA for the purpose of caring for their child.  </p><p>The terms and conditions of the Parental Leave Scheme are contained in my Department's Circular Letter 54/2019  for teachers and Circular Letter 27/2013 for SNAs.  Under the Parental Leave Scheme, an eligible teacher or SNA may avail of Parental Leave in blocks of at least one week up to a maximum of 26 weeks in respect of each child up to the age of 13 years, or the age of 16 years in the case of a child with a disability/long-term illness.  In certain circumstances a teacher or SNA may avail of Parental Leave in the form of individual days where a child has particular medical problems that require the attendance of a parent with the child at a hospital, clinic or therapeutic appointment on a regular basis.</p><p>In January 2022, my Department published Information Note TC 0001/2022 and in February 2022 Information Note TC 0003/2022 which outlined a temporary change to the Parental Leave Scheme for the remainder of the 2021/22 school year.

This followed extensive engagement between the Department and school management bodies with Forsa to work towards a resolution with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  This offer was accepted and the work to implement this agreement has now commenced. This requires a complex process of assimilation and a need to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary. Additional resources are being put in place to provide capacity to manage this process, ensuring both individual and school data is captured and correctly applied. </p>  <p>  The agreement includes moving secretaries to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro-rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern as well as improvements to certain leave entitlements. The Department of Education has issued a circular to schools outlining how the agreement will be implemented. The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement,  schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to secretaries. Where secretaries choose to move to the new terms they will be paid the new rate from September by the school. </p>  <p>  The verification of this first phase, the calculation of back pay and the option to have the value of Jobseekers Benefit included in pay will be addressed in the second phase of the assimilation process. The Department will continue to consider the approach to these further aspects and communicate to the schools as needed over the coming months.  It is my intention to ensure that school caretakers will be included: given the volume of data to be collated and verified, it will be necessary to undertake a separate, similar process in respect of caretakers and this will be progressed as soon as practicable. </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have admission policies, which are published on the schools website. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Nonetheless, where a school is oversubscribed some pupils may not obtain a place in the school.</p>  <p>  The parent of the student, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, may appeal a decision of this school to refuse admission. An appeal may be made under Section 29 (1)(c)(i) of the Education Act 1998 where the refusal to admit was due to the school being oversubscribed.</p>  <p>  Where an applicant has been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, the applicant must request a review of that decision by the board of management prior to making an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.</p>  <p>  TUSLA&rsquo;s Education Support Service (TESS) which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new Special Education teacher (SET) posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. Provision for 14,385 SET&rsquo;s as at 31st December 2022 will represent an increase of 48% since 2011 at which time 9,740 were provided.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teacher (SET) Allocation model was introduced in 2017 to allocate the total number of available SET posts on the basis of the educational profile of each school and replaced the previous diagnosis led approach for the allocation of additional teaching time to students with special educational needs and is a more transparent and equitable way of allocating teaching resources to schools. </p>  <p>  The model is designed so that each school profiles is updated on a regular basis and the most recent update to school profiles took place earlier this year to take account of the latest available data including enrolments and to provide schools with their SET allocation for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The reprofiling of the model takes place to ensure the SET hours are distributed in a fair and equitable way which aligns the available resources to the areas of greatest need in our mainstream schools as identified by the SET allocation model.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 SET posts bringing the total number of SET posts for distribution across primary and post primary schools to 14,385 for 2022/23.  The 620 posts were allocated as follows:   </p>  <p>a.  120 of the posts are being set aside to cater for exceptional reviews to be carried out by the NCSE over the year.  A review will be carried out where a school demonstrates a significant change in their education profile which requires additional SET support.</p>  <p>b.  100 SET posts are being utilised to address the unique needs of a small number of new and developing schools.  These are schools which are developing rapidly and have enrolled a significant numbers of students with complex needs recently. In the absence of a full redistribution of all losses and gains under the allocation model which would address their situation, a special allocation of posts is required to address their particular circumstances. These posts are being distributed in accordance with the model.</p>  <p>c.  The balance of 400 SET posts are being distributed across schools on the basis of the level of need identified under the SET model.</p>  <p>  On completion of the reprofiling exercise a total of 14,265 SET posts were allocated based on the special education needs identified within the model and the remaining 120 posts will be assigned throughout the 2022/23 school year under the NCSE exceptional review process to schools where an  exceptional or unexpected change in its education profile  occurs. </p></reply>

This followed extensive engagement between the Department and school management bodies with Forsa to work towards a resolution with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  This offer was accepted and the work to implement this agreement has now commenced. This requires a complex process of assimilation and a need to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary. Additional resources are being put in place to provide capacity to manage this process, ensuring both individual and school data is captured and correctly applied.</p>  <p>  The agreement includes moving secretaries to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro-rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern as well as improvements to certain leave entitlements. The Department of Education has issued a circular to schools outlining how the agreement will be implemented. The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement,  schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to secretaries. Where secretaries choose to move to the new terms they will be paid the new rate from September by the school.</p>  <p>  Where a secretary chooses to  move to the new terms then they may also opt for an additional benefit to cover the value of certain social welfare benefits related to periods of layoff and have that salary &lsquo;annualised&rsquo; across 52 weeks, thereby removing the requirement to seek jobseekers benefit during school holidays. </p>  <p>  The verification of this first phase, the calculation of back pay and the option to have the value of Jobseekers Benefit included in pay will be addressed in the second phase of the assimilation process. The Department will continue to consider the approach to these further aspects and communicate to the schools as needed over the coming months.</p></reply>

As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021/2022 school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.</p>  <p>  Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, over the last two year, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, already opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  The Department and the NCSE continue to prioritise and support this work.</p>  <p>  The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience. The Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  </p>  <p>  The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.</p>  <p>  There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. The NCSE is looking at local information in relation to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.</p>  <p>  NCSE have been working with stakeholders in the counties referenced by the Deputy for a number of years to meet the identified need in the county.  SENOs are currently engaged with parents, schools and Boards of Management in these counties to establish the level of need and to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to meet that need.</p>  <p>  I should also state that Budget 2022 has provided funding to the Department and the NCSE for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places this year. This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to over 2,400 in the 2022/2023 school year.</p>  <p>  The list of special schools is available on the NCSE website at the following link: ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NCSE-Special-School-Allocations-21-22-website-03-12-2021.pdf.</p>  <p>  and for special classes at: ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Final-2021_2022-Sp-Class-list-25_03_22.pdf.</p></reply>

Through the curriculum objectives, children are supported to develop <i>self-confidence</i>and a <i>positive sense of self,</i>and to appreciate<i>and respect the diversity that exists in society</i>and to respect and appreciate human and cultural diversity. To this end, the curriculum aims to foster in the child a sense of care and respect for himself/herself and others and an appreciation of the dignity of every human being.</p><p>The SPHE curriculum also places emphasis on the use of inclusive and respectful language to promote a positive school climate where all children are valued, cared for and respected. Within the strand <i>Myself, </i>children are encouraged to see themselves as unique individuals and that <i>individuality is expressed in many different ways</i>. In the strand unit <i>Developing citizenship </i>where difference is celebrated, children are provided with opportunity to explore the diversity of the world in which they live, examine how inequality and discrimination can occur and suggest ways this might be addressed. This curriculum has been in place since 1999.</p><p>In 2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) conducted a review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) at primary and post-primary levels. The full report from the review is available here: ncca.ie/media/4319/report-on-the-review-of-relationships-and-sexuality-education-rse-in-primary-and-post-primary-schools.pdf.</p><p>The review found that &quot;<i>The need to review the curriculum and bring it up-to-date is clear&quot; </i>(NCCA, 2019, p. 73). The following areas were specifically mentioned as needing to be considered and addressed in an updated curriculum: </p><p>-  The effects of the internet and social media on relationships </p><p>-  Self-identity and self-esteem</p><p>-  Consent and its relevance to all interpersonal relationships </p><p>-  LGBTQ+ matters </p><p>-  Healthy positive sexual expression </p><p>-  Developments in contraception. </p><p>In addition, the review found the need to provide clarity on topics which need to be addressed at different stages of children&rsquo;s development ensuring they are taught in sensitive and age-appropriate ways. </p><p>The SPHE curriculum at primary level is being reviewed and redeveloped in line with the wider review and redevelopment of the entire Primary School Curriculum. A key document, the Primary Curriculum Framework which will set the foundation upon which curriculum specifications will be developed, will be furnished to the Minister in late 2022. Following approval by the Minister, the Framework will be published. </p><p>Work on the specifications related to the framework, including the curriculum area of Wellbeing (which includes learning pertaining to SPHE/RSE) formally commences in September 2022 with the establishment of Development Groups with responsibility for the development of the curriculum area. </p><p>Initial work has begun on developing the research base for the curriculum area of Wellbeing. NCCA is currently tendering for researchers to develop a comprehensive research base upon which the specification will be developed. It is expected that the research will be published in Spring 2023.</p><p>Building on the findings of the Review of RSE, NCCA is committed to developing an inclusive, age-appropriate curriculum that ensures that all children and young people can recognise themselves, their families and communities reflected across their learning.</p><p>NCCA expects to have a draft specification for Wellbeing published for public consultation in late 2023/early 2024. </p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385.</p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. </p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act</p>  <p>   When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.  </p>  <p>  Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status.</p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools.</p></reply>

This provides for continuity of experience and progression in language learning as children make the transition from pre-school to primary to post-primary.</p><p><b>Early Years</b></p><p>A number of key frameworks for early learning and care settings place a focus on the recognition of children where English may be an additional language, including S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education; Aistear, the Early Childhood Curricular Framework, and the Education Inspection Quality Framework. The frameworks provide guidance to early years educators about how children&rsquo;s language development can be supported and promoted through quality, play-based early years provision. The guidance also covers key areas such as: inclusion, diversity, children&rsquo;s individual needs, recognition, appreciation, representation and use of home languages in the Early Learning and Care (ELC) setting, and working in partnership with families in supporting language development. </p><p>The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has responsibility for the continuing professional development of early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners, and supports have been provided at pre-school level through his Department.</p></reply>

A second was held in Dublin Castle and this provided an opportunity for stakeholders to engage with the findings.</p><p>More than 20 primary and post primary schools, representing a range of school types and experiences were directly involved in the review.  The outcome from this strand of the review informed recommendations in relation to curriculum gaps, implementation barriers and enablers, and support needs.

As part of the consultation process that formed a key part of the review of RSE, NCCA met with student groups including the ISSU, Comhairle na nOg groups and representatives from LGBTQ youth groups. In addition, focus group meetings were held with children and young people across 23 schools, representing a diversity of types of schools &ndash; both primary and post-primary.  And finally, as part of the review, more than 500 students contributed their views via an online consultation questionnaire. The full report from the review is available on the NCCA's website: ncca.ie </p>  <p>  ncca.ie/media/4319/report-on-the-review-of-relationships-and-sexuality-education-rse-in-primary-and-post-primary-schools.pdf.</p>  <p>  Since then, the work of the curriculum development groups has continued to be informed by ongoing consultations with young people. Specifically, focus group consultations were conducted in school settings to inform the background paper for an updated Junior Cycle Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum, of which RSE is a component, and students were consulted again when the background paper was published. The consultation report on the background paper and brief for the review of Junior Cycle SPHE is also available at ncca.ie. </p>  <p>  Relationship Sexuality Education; RSE (ncca.ie)</p>  <p>  There will be further consultations with students in the Autumn as part of the consultation on the draft updated Junior Cycle specification &ndash; this will involve both face-to-face meetings and gathering feedback via online tools. Ongoing consultation with children and young people also forms a key part of the work as developments progress at primary and senior cycle levels. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I recently introduced secondary legislation which ensures that the ISSU is now represented on the NCCA Council. </p></reply>

The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education and Skills on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that this pupil has been deemed eligible to the school they are attending and a request has been sent to Bus Eireann to provide a report on this matter.  Once details have been received, Bus &Eacute;ireann and School Transport Section of my Department will liaise with the family directly. </p></reply>

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities/additional needs in the ECCE Programme. </p><p>The goal of AIM is to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. </p><p>AIM is based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting. It does not require any diagnosis, recognising that many children do not have a diagnosis of a disability/additional need when starting pre-school.</p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme is under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth providing universal pre-school of up to two years for all children. </p><p>AIM involves 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in pre-school. </p><p>More than 4,000 children with disabilities/additional needs receive targeted AIM supports every year to enable them to participate in mainstream pre-school, and many other children are benefitting from universal AIM supports. </p><p>AIM has been recognised internationally and has won awards for both excellence in practice, and inclusive policy.</p><p><b><i>Early Intervention Classes</i></b>are available for children aged 3-5 with autism spectrum disorder. A small number of early intervention classes are available for children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing and children with physical disabilities.</p><p>Early intervention classes follow the Junior/Senior Infant Day i.e. 4 hours 40 minutes each day.</p><p>Schools, in consultation with parents, may reduce the length of the school day for 3 year olds who are unable to manage a full day in the early intervention setting.</p><p>Early intervention classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school. Following early intervention children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class.</p><p><b>Please note: A child&rsquo;s attendance in an early intervention class is not, and should not be taken as, an indication that the child will require access to a special class when he/she enrols in primary school.</b></p><p>In the case of an early intervention class for ASD, the professional report must state that the child has been diagnosed with ASD &ndash; the requirement for the report to state that the child has complex or severe learning needs requiring the support of a special class setting, is not necessary in this case.</p><p>In certain circumstances attendance in an early intervention setting (excluding Early Intervention classes in mainstream and special schools) may be supplemented by the Home Tuition grant, where a placement is not available in an Early Intervention Class.  Parents/legal guardians are requested to declare if their child is availing of any of the schemes listed above. </p><p>If the child avails of one of the schemes, after the application for the Home Tuition grant has been approved, parents/legal guardians must notify this Department immediately.</p><p><b>Please note that the maximum number of combined hours which can be availed of under the above schemes is 10 hours per week for children between 2&frac12; and 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for children over 3 years of age.  </b></p><p><i>Early Intervention </i></p><p>A diagnosis of autism (or other disabilities/additional needs) is not required to access AIM supports. However, pre-school children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream pre-schools with additional supports provided through AIM where required.</p></reply>

In addition, many schools, use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>  <p>  Investment and expenditure on sports facilities is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the School Building Programme. The provision of outdoor play areas form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. In addition, my Department provides funding toward the provision of furniture and equipment including PE equipment in both primary and post-primary schools. In relation to post-primary schools, where my Department provides a sports hall as part of a building project, the equipment provided forms part of the overall furniture and equipment grant to that school. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Design Guidelines for all new schools provides for outdoor multi use games areas (hard play areas) and the level of play space provided varies with the size of school.  For example, a new 24 classroom primary school with Special Education Needs classes is provided with 3 ball courts (1,755m&sup2; in total),  2  junior play areas (600m&sup2; in total), as well as Secure hard and soft play area (300m&sup2;) and a 100m&sup2; Sensory Garden.  In respect of new post-primary schools, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school will be provided with 6 ball courts (3,060m&sup2; in total) and a 200m&sup2; secure hard and soft special education play area. The Design Guidelines do not, however, include all-weather sports pitches.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision.  The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  However, the latter stages of the National Development Plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  While being mindful of the future demographic needs in respect of essential mainstream and special education provision particularly on restricted school sites, this will include a modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered. </p>  <p>  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p></reply>

The first year of the project was designed as a developmental year during which CPD and resources were designed and developed to support participating educators and teachers. This first year also included the first in-setting and in-school phase during which a CLIL approach would be implemented. </p>  <p>  Due to COVID-19 and the health advice current at the time it was necessary to postpone the in-setting and in-school phase of the project in 2019/20 and again in 2020/21. In light of this, the CLIL Steering Committee agreed to extend the project to 2024.  My Department&rsquo;s CLIL team, which includes experts from third level institutions and teacher education support services, continued to liaise with schools and settings throughout this period, and developed CLIL based resources in a number of subject areas, such as PE for primary schools, and a dedicated CLIL website www.jct.ie/content_and_language_integrated_learning_(CLIL)/home.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that seven Early Learning and Care settings, six primary schools and two post-primary schools are now approaching the end of the first phase of implementation of a CLIL approach to learning Irish and learning other aspects of the curriculum through Irish. The Early Learning and Care Settings focused on organising &lsquo;Am L&oacute;in&rsquo; activities through Irish. The Orienteering strand of the PE curriculum formed the focus at primary and subjects at post-primary school included Civic Social and Political Education, Social Personal and Health Education and PE.  The experience of these settings and schools will be of great value in informing the next phase of the project. </p>  <p>  The Department is committed to extending opportunities to other English-medium schools and settings to participate in this project.  The Department is currently reaching out to schools and settings with a view to increasing participation next year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that this project which is targeted, in line with the 20-Year Strategy for Irish, at English-medium schools and settings, is at too early a stage to allow any generalisation of findings. In due course, feedback gathered during the course of the project will inform decision making on CLIL as an approach to expanding children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s engagement in learning through Irish.

Since 2017, additional funding has been made available for two seconded teachers and bursaries, awarded through An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG), to support the M&aacute;istir Gairmi&uacute;il san Oideachas in NUI, Galway. The objective of this support is to work towards increasing the number of post-primary teachers who can deliver high quality Irish medium education across a range of subjects in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht schools. Also under the Policy on Gaeltacht Education a new blended-learning M.Ed. on Irish-medium and Gaeltacht Education commenced in Mary Immaculate College in 2018.</p>  <p>  A new policy for Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas is being developed by my Department. The aim of this policy will be to provide a framework for the provision of high quality Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas. The new policy will build on the progress which has been made in the development of the Irish-medium education sector as a result of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education.  A steering group, comprised of relevant stakeholders, has been established to oversee the development of the new policy and to facilitate key stakeholder involvement in its development. A wide range of aspects relating to the delivery of Irish-medium education, including teacher education and teacher supply issues, will be considered as part of the development of the new policy. Research work on the policy is due to commence shortly, while a public consultation process will take place in late 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, An Teastas Iarch&eacute;ime I Dteagasc&Aacute;bharbhunaithe (TTA) SanIarbhunscola&iacute;ocht L&aacute;n-GhaeilgeAgus Ghaeltachta, a postgraduate programme which attends to the specific professional development requirements as well as the mandatory language proficiency required to teach content through Irish in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht post-primary schools, is being offered by Mary Immaculate College in conjunction with Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) and COGG.</p></reply>

This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p>  <p>  The Minor Works Grant (MWG) is capital funding which provides good flexibility to address issues at local school level. Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. </p>  <p>  The works that can be undertaken under minor works scheme include maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds, the purchase of IT related equipment, ventilation improvements, and enhancements to outdoor learning environments.</p>  <p>  The MWG is paid to eligible schools in the free scheme who need not apply to the Department for approval to carry out works or to purchase items covered by the scheme, as a result my Department does not hold records on its utilisation.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have admission policies, which are published on the schools website. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Nonetheless, where a school is oversubscribed some pupils may not obtain a place in the school.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves.</p>  <p>  There is an additional provision in the act that allows Irish medium schools, where it is their policy to do so, to include in their admission policy a priority for the admission of a student who has attained a reasonable age appropriate level of oral fluency in the Irish language and where that student&rsquo;s fluency would be at risk of regressing if the student was not admitted to an Irish medium school. This provision recognises the difficulties that applicants may experience in accessing schools that provide an education though the medium of Irish.</p></reply>

My Department has delivered permanent accommodation for 292 special classes and additional capacity for 122 classrooms in 22 special schools during NDP period 2018 to 2021. A further 700 school building projects currently progressing under the NDP which will deliver over 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement SEN classrooms catering for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils across primary and post primary; almost 100 of these projects are currently on site which will ultimately deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils.  Taken together, this will enable new additional or modernised accommodation at over 50% of our special schools; and 60% of our post-primary schools either have an existing special class or have a project on the School Building Programme which will provide SEN accommodation; </p>  <p>  The NCSE is projecting circa 300 extra classes needed for the 2022/2023 school year and my Department facilitates accommodation solutions where necessary to support the provision of these extra classes.  There are Strategic initiatives in place which support capacity building for SEN provision including the use of a Modular Accommodation Framework and also the expansion of existing planning exemptions for provision of additional accommodation at existing school sites.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the challenges presented by Covid-19, the humanitarian crisis and the challenging market conditions currently underway, and is working proactively to ensure that all school building contracts are delivered as expeditiously as possible, while working within the parameters set by the Office of Government Procurement and principles of public procurement set out at both national and EU level.</p>  <p>With regard to inflation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently (22nd   May 2022) published further measures to address the impact that exceptional inflation in construction materials and energy is having on public works contracts.

I wish to acknowledge the valuable work being done by school principals and wider school authorities in expanding the educational provision for pupils with special educational needs including the required physical infrastructure. I would like to assure the Deputy that the supports for school principals and communities who are supporting children with special education needs is kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  The Department is working actively with the NCSE and other key stakeholders including School Patrons and Management Bodies to provide additional special classes and special school places for the 2022/23 school year so that the remaining gaps in provision from the current provision of circa. 99% to the full 100% is achieved as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department has close engagement with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. The purpose of my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation. While it is open to the school authority to make an application for additional accommodation through the ASA scheme, my Department works closely with schools in order to minimise the amount of information required and to fast-track to the maximum extent possible the application for funding for reconfiguration of existing capacity for special classes in particular.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has additionally provided my Department with projections of future requirements for classes for students with special education requirements.  These are informing my Department's advance planning for special class accommodation which will enhance the opportunities for synergy and minimising the number of projects managed at school level. This advance planning is building on the significant work to date in delivering additional classrooms for students with special education needs.  Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects, unless local circumstances indicate that they will not be required.</p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of building projects, my Department has a number of delivery programmes utilising various procurement methods including individual open market tendering, restricted two stage tendering, design and build and procurement framework arrangements. These methods of construction procurement are selected to suit the various types of school infrastructure requirements based on scope, complexity, programme, location and value for money. My Department&rsquo;s construction procurement methods are continually reviewed in light of these constraints. &ldquo;Bulk ordering&rdquo; of construction infrastructure is problematic due to the bespoke nature of individual school sites and the specific educational requirements of various schools. Furthermore, this method of procurement can lead to calls of restrictive tendering practices which is against EU and national procurement rules.</p>  <p>  In order to assist school authorities and principals with the undoubted workload associated with capital projects, my Department funds external stakeholders engaged in the devolved delivery of building projects for individual schools. These stakeholders such as Patron and managerial bodies, Educational Training Boards and local authorities are funded to procure project managers and services in order to enhance their other support functions to schools on whose behalf they can either deliver projects directly or assist schools in delivering projects. Many school patrons are also funded to employ building officers who advise and support schools regarding how best to manage and address their accommodation requirements.</p>  <p>  Since 2020, each primary school with a teaching principal has been provided with a minimum of one release day per week, with four additional release days allocated to schools with a special class.  Measures announced in Budget 2022 will see administrative principals in primary schools that have two or more special classes from September, regardless of the school&rsquo;s enrolment. Since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. Measures to assist school leadership at post primary include additional posts of responsibility to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school and the appointment of an additional Deputy Principal in schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 pupils or 600 for DEIS 1 post primary schools.</p></reply>

For that reason it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a complete picture in respect of all temporary accommodation at schools as requested.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, within the context of a rapidly increasing school population combined with arriving Ukrainian children, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place.  In this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools. </p>  <p>  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned.  Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.  The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project. </p>  <p>  My Department is taking an integrated approach with the Prefab Replacement Programme through the replacement of prefabricated units as part of large-scale and devolved projects and as part of new projects approved under the Additional School Accommodation scheme.</p>  <p>  There are over 1,300 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025. The progression and completion of these projects is and will make further inroads on the replacement of rented sites and buildings with knock-on savings on the rental budget. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  Many schools based in rented buildings and on rented sites are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their longer-term accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects. Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.</p>  <p>  The changing landscape in relation to enrolments including that of arriving Ukrainian children means that accommodation requirements can vary locally and regionally and between short, medium and long-term and this is a relevant factor considered by the Department in determining the type of accommodation solution to be put in place.</p></reply>

This will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 by the end of 2022. This represents an increase of 81% in SNA numbers since 2011 when 10,575 SNAs were working in our schools. </p>  <p>  The availability of SNAs is critical to the inclusion of students with significant care needs in education and in school life. </p>  <p>  SNAs carry out very important care functions for children with care needs in the school.  The purpose of their role is to enable children with significant care needs to attend school and participate in school activities to the maximum possible extent. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the SNAs in the classroom is to address the immediate physical care needs of the student and encourage their independence.  Over time, with their assistance and support, students will become more independent and self-autonomous in these matters. </p>  <p>  SNAs are whole school resources to be allocated to meet the needs of those students in greatest need. </p>  <p>  A key consideration in the allocation of SNAs is to ensure that those students with the greatest level of care needs receive the most support. This is a key principle underlying Department policy on special education. The allocation system must be objective and fair with the capacity to take account of local and individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  The SNA allocations for all schools for the 2022/23 school year were published on the 31st May and are available on the NCSE website </p>  <p>  SET Hours and SNA Allocations &ndash; National Council for Special Education (ncse.ie)</p>  <p>  Many students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) enrolled in mainstream classes do not have significant care needs and are supported through the Special Education Teacher (SET) allocation in line with their need.</p>  <p>  In mid-April Department officials issued updated staffing allocations for the 2022/23 school year to include SET allocations. This ensured that schools were aware of their teaching resources and this allowed them to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the teaching and learning needs for pupils with SEN can be properly supported. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also provided guidance and support to schools to assist them in ensuring that the resources being provided are best managed to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. The support includes training and advice from special education professionals within the NCSE as part of the NCSE regional support teams.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) are also available to support schools and teachers  in providing a Continuum of Support to their students with SEN.</p></reply>

Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. If a parent/ guardian  consider that a school has erred in their processing of their enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the  application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on your application. Where an error had a material effect on the enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.   </p>  <p>  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission. It is important to note that if a student have been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent / guardian wish to appeal this decision the parent / guardian must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the student .</p>  <p>  If the student has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent/ guardian  may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the student .  </p>  <p>  Where the student have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and does not choose to seek a review by the board of management the parent/ guardian may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest  school/Education Centre as determined by my Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time (apply on time and pay on time) are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible but who apply for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann, who operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, review all school transport services over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have confirmed that generally, pupils residing in the area referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for transport to their school of attendance as it is not their closest school/Education Centre.  There are matters raised in the correspondence submitted in the details supplied which the Department will follow up on separately.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021/22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.   Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  </p>  <p>  Decisions in regard to measures for the 2022/23 school year will be made shortly.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

The numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.</p><p>The Department and the NCSE is planning for special school and special class provision nationwide on an ongoing basis. In recent years the NCSE has enhanced their long term forecasting models and there has been increased engagement and coordination between the Department and the NCSE. This enhanced long term forecasting model and engagement allows for a more efficient and streamlined process of establishing special education places. It allows us to make the best use of our expertise, information and knowledge to help inform decisions around education provision.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>Budget 2022 has provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places this year. This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to 2,435 in the 2022/2023 school year.</p><p>My Department provides funding through a Home Tuition Grant Scheme towards the provision of a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of specific reasons, are unable to attend school, outlined below.</p><p>Home tuition is not an alternative to a school placement and is provided in very limited and specific circumstances.</p><p>The Department provides home tuition grant schemes to provide funding towards the provision of a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of specific reasons, are unable to attend school,</p><p>This strand of the Home Tuition Scheme provides funding towards a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs for whom such a placement is not available. The scheme also provides for early educational intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ,who meet the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, aged from 2.5 - 5 years before they start in school.</p><p>Children aged 4 years and over, including those with ASD, may enrol in primary placements (including special class and special schools placements). All children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday. </p><p>In such circumstances the NCSE will actively engage at local level with schools, Patron Bodies and the families to ensure that suitable places are provided as soon as possible.</p><p>If, following completion of that work, the NCSE has not been able to establish the required school placements it can activate the provisions contained in section 37A of the Education Act 1998 if required.</p><p>The medical strand of the Home Tuition Scheme provides funding towards a compensatory educational service for students, enrolled in schools, with significant medical conditions which has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, major disruption to their attendance at school.</p><p>In exceptional cases the Department will provide home tuition applications on behalf of students with diagnoses of school phobia and/or associated depression/anxiety which causes major disruption to their attendance at school. This exception will only apply where a continued absence from school is required to facilitate appropriate medical or therapeutic intervention with a view to the re-integration of the student in their school.</p><p>The following table outlines the number of home tuition sanctions for the last 2 years under the different categories. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2020/21</th>       <th>2021/22</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Education Home Tuition Schemes</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Age 2.5yrs &ndash; 6yrs*</td>       <td>775</td>       <td>765</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Age 6yrs+  **</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>77</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical</td>       <td>227</td>       <td>195</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mental Health</td>       <td>346</td>       <td>291</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* These relate in the main to the early intervention supports available to students before they commence in primary school.</p><p>** These children with SEN were 6 years old when sanction was approved and without the offer of a school place.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  SNA support is allocated to special classes and special schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Under the allocation model for special classes and special schools, the SNA allocation can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time. There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio.</p>  <p>  ASD special classes have an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. </p>  <p>  Additional SNA support may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school. In such circumstances, the school may apply to the NCSE for access to additional care supports, clearly outlining the reason why the additional support is necessary.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations and the school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  Support and resources in the area of online safety and digital citizenship are provided by Webwise. Webwise promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents/guardians and learners themselves with consistent and relevant messages.  Webwise and PDST Technology in Education are currently developing a new online cyberbullying course which seeks to inform teachers and school leaders about cyberbullying and outlines a school&rsquo;s role in relation to creating an anti-cyberbullying culture and promoting student wellbeing including online wellbeing. This course aims to provide both primary and post-primary teachers with the knowledge, resources and confidence needed to teach about cyberbullying and deal with cyberbullying incidents as they arise.</p>  <p>  There are also extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying.</p>  <p>  A new Digital Strategy for schools, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027, was published in April. The Strategy will advance the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment, building on the work under previous strategies. Online safety and the safe and ethical use of digital technologies is a key component of the new Strategy. The Strategy will continue to work towards ensuring that learners have the opportunity to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner and that their voices are heard and taken into account in further developments in this area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year I  established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. </p>  <p>  The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It will specifically consider cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. </p>  <p>  The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland. The Steering Committee has held six meetings to date.  </p>  <p>  The Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools will also be reviewed and updated in parallel with this work. A working group comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU has been established to review the anti-bullying procedures.</p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015, the Teaching Council is the body with the statutory authority and responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland including the registration of teachers in the State. It acts in the interests of the public good while upholding and enhancing standards in the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council registers teachers in line with the requirements set out in the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and the Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016. It is a requirement under Section 30 of the Act for teachers to be registered with the Teaching Council in order to receive payment from State funds.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has developed a tailored registration process to support the registration of qualified Ukrainian teachers who have been granted Temporary Protection under the EU Temporary Protection Directive, and that process is in line with the requirements of the Commission Regulation. At least one Ukrainian teaching qualification has already been recognised.</p>  <p>  A dedicated email, ukrainianteachers@teachingcouncil.ie has been set up to support applicants, with processing of applications received underway.</p>  <p>  By way of background, on 5th April 2022, the European Commission published Recommendation (EU) 2022/554 concerning the recognition of qualifications for people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This recommendation addresses the access of those fleeing the war to regulated professions. It provides Member States' authorities with guidance and practical advice to ensure a quick, fair and flexible recognition process. Its stated goal is to help those fleeing the war to find a path to meaningful employment, while facilitating their integration. The Recommendation, inter alia, encourages Member States to: </p>  <p>  - reduce the formalities for recognition of professional qualifications to a minimum;  </p>  <p>  - speed up the process by putting in place fast-track procedures for handling applications of professionals enjoying temporary protection; </p>  <p>  - ensure that only essential documents are required; </p>  <p>  - accept other forms of proof than original documents (e.g. digital copies); </p>  <p>  - dispense with certain requirements, e.g. not asking for certified translations.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this Recommendation, the European Commission is hosting a number of focused meeting with EU Member States. Ireland has been represented at these meetings by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, as part of its national coordination role for Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications. </p>  <p>  This work with the European Commission is ongoing in relation to the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people in Ireland to ensure an EU-wide appropriate response.</p></reply>

The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the 2022/2023 school year on 31 May 2022. The arrangements include the following provisions: </p>  <p>  - SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year are being maintained at existing levels to give schools clarity and certainty, a process is now available to schools where their change needs have reduced to contact the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) so as to ensure that resources are focused on schools with the greater care needs. </p>  <p>  - The exceptional review process can result in an increase or decrease in SNA resources depending on changing care needs in a school.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to their allocation.</p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools</p>  <p>  Schools have maintained their SNA allocations since 2019 and in addition an average of 1,000 SNAs per annum have been allocated to schools since that time in 2020 and again in 2021. This year 1,165 extra SNAs will be allocated to schools for the 2022/23 school year &ndash; 620 in special schools and classes and 545 across mainstream setting. This will bring the total of SNAs in our schools to 19,169 &ndash; a record number of SNAs supporting children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. </p>  <p>  The works that can be undertaken under minor works scheme include maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds, the purchase of IT related equipment, ventilation improvements, and enhancements to outdoor learning environments.</p>  <p>  It is open to the school to make an application under the Summer Works Scheme. The purpose of the Summer Works Scheme is to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works which, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school.</p>  <p>  It is also open to the school to make an application under the Emergency Works Scheme in emergency situations. </p>  <p>  The Emergency Works Scheme ensures the availability of funding for urgent works to schools that need resources as a result of an emergency situation, or to cater for special needs pupils who have enrolled.</p>  <p>  An emergency is a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, that happens in sudden, unforeseen circumstances and requires immediate action, and if not corrected, would prevent the school, or part of it, from opening.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of the area specifically referenced by the Deputy, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools in these areas. This is also the case in the broader North Dublin region where work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.</p><p>Currently, there is a network of 33 primary special classes, including 4 Early Intervention classes, and 10 post primary special classes provide specialist placements for students with autism in Dublin 5, 13 and 17.  4 of these classes were newly established for the current school year.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. </p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act. When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.  </p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>In April 2022, the Department issued updated staffing allocations for the 2022/23 school year to include SET allocations. This ensured that schools were aware of their teaching resources and this allowed them to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the teaching and learning needs for pupils with SEN can be properly supported. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also provided guidance and support to schools to assist them in ensuring that the resources being provided are best managed to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. The support includes training and advice from special education professionals within the NCSE as part of the NCSE regional support teams. </p><p>The availability of SNAs is critical to the inclusion of students with significant care needs in education and in school life. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. </p><p>The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the 2022/2023 school year at the end of May. The arrangements include the following provisions:  </p><p>- SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year are being maintained at existing levels to give schools clarity and certainty, a process is now available to schools where their change needs have reduced to contact the NCSE so as to ensure that resources are focused on schools with the greater care needs.  </p><p>- The exceptional review process can result in an increase or decrease in SNA resources depending on changing care needs in a school. It is also intended to work on a rolling exceptional review pilot with the NCSE over the summer in consultation with our education partners.</p><p>A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The Special Educational Needs provision for 22/23  for the school mentioned above is as follows:</p><p>Special Education Teacher Hours 22/23: 125 (increased from 87.5 in 2021/22) increased by 43% </p><p>Special Class Teaching Posts 22/23: 2.0</p><p>Mainstream SNA Allocation 22/23: 4.33</p><p>Special Class SNAs 22/23: 4.50</p><p>Total SNA Allocation: 8.83</p></reply>

The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports.  SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required.

The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the 2022/2023 school year on 31 May 2022. The arrangements include the following provisions: </p>  <p>  - SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year are being maintained at existing levels to give schools clarity and certainty, a process is now available to schools where their change needs have reduced to contact the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) so as to ensure that resources are focused on schools with the greater care needs. </p>  <p>  - The exceptional review process can result in an increase or decrease in SNA resources depending on changing care needs in a school.</p>  <p>  Schools have maintained their SNA allocations since 2019 and in addition an average of 1,000 SNAs per annum have been allocated to schools since that time in 2020 and again in 2021. This year 1,165 extra SNAs will be allocated to schools for the 2022/23 school year &ndash; 620 in special schools and classes and 545 across mainstream setting. This will bring the total of SNAs in our schools to 19,169 &ndash; a record number of SNAs supporting children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  It was intended to introduce a front loaded model of SNA allocations for 2022/2023 however to do now would be very significantly disruptive to schools at a time when they are still managing the impacts of Covid-19 and staffing challenges including for SNA. Work has been ongoing on an appropriate front loading SNA model that is fully cognisant of matching SNA resources with the care needs of those children who need it and while significant progress has been made it has become clear that to introduce it now would not achieve this.</p></reply>

It is not yet possible to fully assess at this point how many students will become eligible for the deferred sitting and how many exams each will need to take.</p>  <p>  The timeline for marking the examinations critically depends on the availability of sufficient numbers of experienced examiners to mark candidates&rsquo; work.

This was to ensure that the students of 2022 are not disadvantaged relative to those in 2021. This will require time for analysis, implementation and quality assurance. This work can only be completed when the marking of the deferred examinations has itself been completed.</p>  <p>  It has to be recognised that sufficient time must also be allowed for the range of checks and quality assurance procedures which are required in the resulting process to ensure that the highest standards possible are maintained.</p>  <p>  With the above range of factors in play, it is not possible to give a date for issue of the results at this time.

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies/school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p>  <p>  There is a number of building projects planned for the South Kildare area: </p>  <p>  - Curragh Post-Primary School - Following an extensive site identification, assessment and negotiation process, agreement in principle, subject to contract, has been reached for the acquisition, by the Department of Education, of a permanent school site in Kildare Town to provide a replacement school for the Curragh Post Primary School. This site will accommodate 1,000 pupils and will include a 4 classroom special education needs unit. The new school will cater for the increased demographic growth at post-primary level due to occur in the Kildare South region over the coming years, the majority of which is projected to occur in Kildare Town. The location of this 8 acre greenfield site is next to two existing primary schools, Kildare Town Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha, within the grounds of the former Magee Barracks, Kildare Town. The development of the post primary school on this site will enhance the education facilities available to the Curragh Post Primary School and the existing primary schools in a new educational campus arrangement. Due to commercial sensitivities, it is not possible to provide further information at this time. </p>  <p>  - Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen - project at stage 2a (Developed Sketch Scheme). This project will provide for an extension to expand the school to cater for 1,000 pupils. </p>  <p>  - Patrician Secondary School, Newbridge - project at stage 2a (Developed Sketch Scheme). This project will provide for an expansion of the school to cater for 1,000 pupils. </p>  <p>  - Ardscoil Rathangan - Additional School Accommodation (ASA) project approved for this school to allow for the school to expand to 750 pupils. </p>  <p>  - St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College, Newbridge - Plans to expand this school being discussed with the patron Kildare Wicklow ETB. </p>  <p>  - St. Paul&rsquo;s Secondary School, Monasterevin - project on site to provide a replacement new school to cater for 850 pupils. </p>  <p>  - Holy Family Secondary School, Newbridge (application received and currently under assessment)</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that there are currently places available in St. Conleth's Post-Primary School in Newbridge for the 2022/23 school year. My Department's engagement with Patrons/school authorities is ongoing and is focused on ensuring that the start of the 2022/23 school year operates as smoothly as possible for all schools and their students. The Department is satisfied that with the additional places proposed with these building projects that the projected enrolments for South Kildare can be catered for within the existing schools in the school planning areas of South Kildare.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  SNA support is allocated to special classes and special schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Under the allocation model for special classes and special schools, the SNA allocation can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time. There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio.</p>  <p>  ASD special classes have an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. </p>  <p>  Additional SNA support may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school. In such circumstances, the school may apply to the NCSE for access to additional care supports, clearly outlining the reason why the additional support is necessary.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations and the school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required.</p></reply>

Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. Schools can use age as a selection criterion should they wish to do so. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. In cases where my Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for the School Transport Scheme will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language. To establish that the nearest school is full parents/guardians must provide certain documentary evidence including confirmation that an application for enrolment in the nearest school was made within the deadline dates specified by the school and confirmation from the school authorities that the school was full.</p>  <p>  Consistent with primary level national enrolments which peaked in 2018, records available to my Department indicate that the school referred to by the Deputy has also experienced a decreased enrolment in recent years. My Department&rsquo;s demographic projections indicate a continuing decline in primary school enrolments of over 120,000 by 2033. Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure. While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools.</p>  <p>  My Department already has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands. The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and is regularly updated. Specifically, in the Ballinasloe School Planning Area, there is a new school planned for Scoil an Chroi Naofa and the brief for this has been revised to cater for a principal and 16 mainstream classrooms to cater for future demand in the area.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p><p>The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p><p>a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p><p>b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p><p>c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p> <blockquote> 	i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <br /><br />ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <br /><br />iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term.  </blockquote>  <p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014, circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website: ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE, ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs including such ICT devices: assets.gov.ie/12695/2045e7ccec684f72b55d93930e45372c.pdf</p>  <p>  This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.).</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices with cost and other implications been fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. </p>  <p>  Schools, in conjunction with parents, are responsible for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools.</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2027, which builds on the progress made under the previous Digital Strategy, will be underpinned by an investment of some &euro;200m subject to the available exchequer funding, and was included in the National Development Plan 2021-2030. The first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy ICT grant funding issued to schools in December 2021. This funding issued directly to schools as schools are best placed to identify the requirements of their own student cohort and to meet those requirements in the most appropriate way. This can include the purchase of ICT devices such as tablets, hybrid devices, or laptops. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, issued a once-off grant of &euro;50million in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme in order to support those learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide,</p>  <p>  Details of the Grant Scheme for EU NRRP Funding to schools to address the digital divide, and learners at risk of educational disadvantage which can be found at: </p>  <p> www.gov.ie/en/circular/b4fea-grant-scheme-for-eu-nrrp-funding-to-schools-to-address-the-digital-divide-and-learners-at-risk-of-educational-disadvantage/</p>  <p>  This funding issued directly to schools as they were best placed to determine the needs of their own students and have autonomy to do so, within the criteria applying to this funding.</p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p><p>Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in Lucan show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term.  The Department is aware of some local pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas across the country, including the Lucan school planning area.</p><p>However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors: </p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area. </p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area. </p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils. </p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities/patrons.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies/school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s)  which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p><p>There are 8 post primary schools in the Lucan school planning area and building projects are proposed,  in train or have been delivered as outlined :</p><p>St Joseph's College RN 60263V - a major building project for an extension/refurbishment, which will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3 (tender stage). In the interim, six prefabs were approved in October 2021 pending the delivery of the major project and are now on site .</p><p>Griffeen Community College RN 76454S - a major project is currently at Stage 2b which will ultimately provide capacity for 1,000 pupils in the school.  Nine modular classrooms have recently been approved pending the delivery of the major project .  </p><p>St Kevin's Community College RN 70042L - Four modular classrooms were approved in September 2021 and are now on site.</p><p>Lucan Community College RN 70080T - a major project comprising an extension / refurbishment is currently at Stage 2b and when completed, will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils.</p><p>Col&aacute;iste Cois Life RN76065H - 7 modular classrooms + Specialist rooms were approved in September 2021 and are now on site.</p><p>Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig RN 60264A - my Department has recently approved grant to the school to provide additional specialist accommodation.</p><p>Adamstown Community College RN76097U - a new 1,000 pupil post primary school has been constructed for this school.</p><p>Kishogue Community College RN 76152C - a new 1,000 pupil post primary school has been constructed for this school. </p><p>The annual admissions notice for each of the schools in the Lucan school planning area is available on the individual school website.</p><p>I understand that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  My Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities in order to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required.</p><p>Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in Lucan and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future. It is expected that the schools in the school planning area for Lucan can cater for the projected enrolment in the interim period pending the completion of the major projects.</p></reply>

DEIS supports also include the allocation of Deputy Principal posts and Administrative Principal posts at a lower enrolment threshold for DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan is based on the premise that if we are to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of educational disadvantage, then our extra resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.

Under this scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools. Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. </p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need.  Therefore, my Department does not hold information in relation to the number of schools that run a free book scheme. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents.</p>  <p>  Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. </p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021/22 school year and the effectiveness and impact of the pilot will be evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is mainly done through the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. The SPHE course covers student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is developed.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Know the Score&rsquo;, launched in November 2019, is the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students and was developed in partnership between public health and education professionals, with input from teachers and young people. This resource for teachers of senior cycle students is aimed at guiding and supporting them to improve their knowledge and strengthen their skills in dealing with the risks associated with alcohol and drugs.</p>  <p>  Aimed at 15-18 year olds, the content is based on research about effective approaches to the prevention of substance misuse. Students and teachers were involved in the design of the 14 lessons and supporting digital content, which aim to facilitate informed discussions about alcohol and drugs in the classroom.</p>  <p>  Topics addressed include building cultural awareness of attitudes towards alcohol in Ireland, the impact of alcohol on the body and the brain, the influences of alcohol branding and sponsorship and information on how to provide emergency care if they are concerned about someone who has been drinking or taking drugs.</p></reply>

This has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Additionally, it is general practice to include a SEN Base in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless exceptional local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. The extent of provision made at these schools is informed by the level of demand in the area as well as the size of the school.</p><p>I can also clarify that the NCSE maintains records of students enrolled in special classes, students enrolled in special schools as well as students seeking places in special classes and special schools.  </p><p>Parents seeking special class/school placements for their children are advised to contact NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes.</p><p>The local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: <i>ncse.ie/regional-servic</i><i></i>. </p></reply>

In cases where an individual has been in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment in respect of one qualified child, both the personal rate of payment and the increase for a qualified child, will continue for six weeks after the death of that child.</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend also remain in payment for up to six weeks after the death of a qualifying child.  Eligibility may continue beyond those six weeks if there are other children associated with the claim.</p>  <p>  In the case of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, payment continues to be made for twelve weeks after the death of the person who was being cared for, including where this was a child.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit continues to be paid for six weeks and Domiciliary Care Allowance continues to be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.  In 2021, approximately 2,400 exceptional needs payments totalling &euro;5.1 million were made in relation to funeral and burial costs.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, &euro;60,000 was allocated to the Irish Hospice Foundation, to carry out a research project into funeral poverty in Ireland, together with the wider economic impact of bereavement. I understand that the report is near completion.</p>  <p>  Any increases in the social welfare supports available to bereaved parents and carers could only be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

Staff in the Communications Unit are fully trained in the use of Plain English and content design.</p><p>One element of the web content that is monitored is the reading age. In migrating to <i>www.gov.ie</i>, the reading age of the Department's services was reduced from 21 years to 15.2 years and this is an ever-evolving process.  The Government is committed to making<i>www.gov.ie</i>accessible to all users. </p><p>Furthermore, we continually to strive to improve the accessibility of our more traditional communications with our customers.  Evidence of this can be seen from the development of the Illness, Disability and Caring Guide, which I launched last December.  This helpful guide contains alternative text in tables and pictures to assist persons who use screen readers. </p><p>Also, in relation to the withdrawal of Ulster Bank from the Irish market, my Department is currently writing to customers, including those in receipt of State Pensions, who use Ulster Bank accounts to receive their payments from the Department.  These letters set out in clear language the steps the person should take to switch payment details so as to ensure there is no disruption to their payments.</p></reply>

Based on the number of carers identified in Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost in the order of an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  This would result in the provision of payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to fund other critical schemes and services.</p><p>The income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  Since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, supporting carers has been a key priority for me. </p><p>In this year&rsquo;s Budget, I made significant changes to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test which took effect at the beginning of June: </p><p>- The capital/savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment has been increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance.  </p><p>- For carers who work, I have increased the weekly income disregard from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner. </p><p>These are the first changes that have been made to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test in 14 years.  </p><p>A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance had been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p><p>Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p><p>It should be noted that both the monthly Domiciliary Care Allowance and the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant are available to family carers providing full-time care and assistance regardless of means.  As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850.  On Thursday 2 June the grant was paid to some 121,000 carers and their families.  The overall cost of the grant in 2022 is expected to be over &euro;241 million.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Disparities in preferences for flexibility across countries are likely driven by the design of pension systems in each country.   </p>  <p>  - Ireland has a flat rate, rather than earnings related, State Pension payment  system.  While it makes the State Pension system effective at      redistribution and reducing pensioner poverty, it can also limit the extent to which flexibility can be introduced into the system. </p>  <p>  - The gender and equality impacts of this issue are difficult to quantify.  </p>  <p>  - As the labour market evolves, increasingly people are moving between employments more fluidly.  Individuals who wish to continue working but can no longer work in their current job should be facilitated in moving to another area of employment.  </p>  <p>  - There are alternative social welfare payments in Ireland for those who are unable to work past 65 years of age, including the Benefit Payment for 65Year Olds, Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit.</p>  <p>  Successive Governments have committed to supporting older peoples&rsquo; continued engagement in economic and social life, including in the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), the Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives (2016) and the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023 (2018).  Building on the work of these previous groups and reports, the Pensions Commission supported measures to facilitate and encourage fuller working lives.  </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and it set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard, including flexible access to the State Pension. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.  It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

General increase to the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes / recipients (under66 years of age) by &euro;5 per week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates;</p><p>2.

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>Within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division has been newly established. The team includes more than 80 staff. The majority of these staff have moved from within the Department with consequent impacts on ongoing work priorities. The Division also includes new staff and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p>  <p>Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>Providing accommodation and supports to displaced persons from Ukraine would not be possible without the whole of society response including the contributions from stakeholders, volunteers and the Irish public in general.  My Department is in regular contact with all the relevant stakeholders to facilitate the provision of supports and services to Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection. </p>  <p>This includes the Local Authorities who have stood up the Community Response Forum at local level which brings together organisations, statutory bodies such as Tusla and the HSE, and volunteers at a local level to link services to those that need them. It is within this forum that particular issues relating to needs of displaced persons are raised and brought to the attention of state agencies and voluntary groups who can assist.</p>  <p>Furthermore, my Department has regular engagement with NGOs working in this sector. They have been extremely supportive and my Department is committed to continued cooperation and collaboration in assisting displaced persons fleeing conflict in Ukraine, including elderly persons.</p>  <p>I have had the privilege in recent weeks to travel around the country to speak with representatives of community groups, family resource centres and youth services as well as those who are on the front line of this engagement. In particular, I thank the community groups around the country that have done so much, individually and collectively, to welcome those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine to our country.</p></reply>

A particular priority in the Annual Capital Programmes has been the creation of places for children under 3.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for young children.</p><p>Lower demand for early learning and childcare owing to Covid-19 gave rise to unprecedented vacancy rates in 2020 and 2021, with data from June 2021 revealing an overall vacancy rate of 21% and vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years of 20% and 10% respectively.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the data captured by City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) and Pobal over April and May of this year reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13% and the vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years 14% and 6% respectively.</p><p>The network of 30 CCC across the country are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. CCC are also proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of undersupply. </p><p>Currently, there is no specific data on the number of early learning and childcare providers that have reopened baby rooms. In addition, there is no requirement for providers to offer places to children under 2. Recent data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile reveal just 15% of all services cater for children under 1, while 27% of services cater for children aged 1-2.</p><p>A range of steps are being taken by my Department to address issues of under supply. Some &euro;70m  has been allocated for early learning and childcare under the National Development Plan, the majority of which has been earmarked for new places. Work is underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Early Learning and Childcare Services, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The new Core Funding Scheme, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. This means higher levels of funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher. I am hopefully this new approach to funding will encourage services to operate baby and toddler rooms, where demand exists.  </p><p>Parents currently experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

The second reduction was in 2018 whereby the number of points at which a child could become eligible for the programme was reduced down to one (September) and the age of eligibility was further reduced. </p><p>A child must now have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year). This has allowed children to avail of a full two years of the ECCE programme. This change was based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory requirements for early learning and and care. </p><p>There is no situation in which a child is only entitled to one year of the ECCE programme and the current arrangements ensure that all children have the same entitlement, unlike the 3 entry point system. It should also be noted that whilst there is one point at which the child becomes eligible, eligible children can enter the ECCE programme at any time during the 2 year cycle.</p><p>I would also highlight the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to help with early learning and childcare costs. There are two types of subsidy for children over 6 months of age:</p><p>- A <b>universal </b>subsidy for children under 3. Children over 3 who have not yet qualified for the ECCE programme are also eligible. It is not means tested. From September 2022, this subsidy will be extended to children of all ages up to 15. </p><p>- An <b>income-assessed</b>subsidy for children up to 15. It is means tested.</p><p>The NCS is currently supporting thousands of families to offset their costs.  A recent review of the NCS showed that: </p><p>- 38% families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS; </p><p>- 56% families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and </p><p>- 28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it.  </p><p>I would note that my Department will shortly commence a 12 month review of the ECCE programme which will consider whether the programme is meeting its objectives and subject to the findings consider whether any changes need to be made. As part of this review, there will be wide stakeholder engagement.</p></reply>

Tusla is funded from my Department through Vote 40.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach, Minister McEntee and myself have worked intensively with Departmental officials on the Audit of the segmentation of Government&rsquo;s response to DSGBV and how the results of that Audit fits with the, soon to be published, Third National Strategy on DSGBV. As a result of those discussions and in response to the Audit, it has been agreed that the Department of Justice will be the lead Department with responsibility for responding to DSGBV, and that responsibility for policy, accommodation and services will also sit within the Department of Justice. Tusla will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services while the new administrative arrangements are put in place. </p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department allocated Tusla with &euro;28m in core funding for DSGBV services plus &euro;2m in contingency funding to address challenges arising from COVID-19. In 2022, funding has been increased to &euro;31.5m which includes an additional &euro;0.5m funding for Tusla DSGBV services and the retention of a further &euro;2.0m used for once off funding in 2021. This funding will maintain continuity of services including core sustainability costs, ongoing support for initiatives commenced in 2021 and to support implementation of the recommendations of Tusla's review of accommodation for victims of DSGBV.</p>  <p>  The total funding allocated to domestic violence refuge services in 2022 and the expenditure to date are an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The most recent available data indicates the average hourly wage for non-managerial staff in the sector in 2021 was &euro;12.60, with many staff working part-time or on temporary contracts. This data underscores the need for significant improvement in both pay and conditions of employment.</p><p>The State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.</p><p>In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, which began meeting in December 2021.</p><p>The outcomes of the Joint Labour Committee process will be supported by the new Core Funding stream I announced in Budget 2022 which will provide an additional &euro;73 million of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;221 million in a full year. Core Funding is expected, among other objectives, to support Employment Regulation Orders that may arise from the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, improving workforce recruitment and retention through improvement in pay and conditions.</p><p>In addition, last December I launched <i>Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028</i>. <i>Nurturing Skills </i>aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five &quot;pillars&quot; comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector. </p><p>A comprehensive Implementation Plan is included within <i>Nurturing Skills </i>and covers the first phase of implementation from 2022-2024. A Monitoring Committee is currently being established with the task of monitoring the implementation of <i>Nurturing Skills</i>.</p></reply>

The report of the advisory group published in October 2020 (also known as the Catherine Day report) fed into the creation of the White Paper. In the fourteen months since its publication my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants. The progress made has included: </p><p>- Establishment of a dedicated transition team to drive implementation of the programme.</p><p>- Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants. </p><p>- Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress. The board most recently met on the 28th April and are due to meet again in July to review project timelines in light of the Ukraine Crisis. A Risk Committee to oversee the management of risks as part of the Programme Board governance framework has also been appointed.</p><p>- Significant progress has been made on the establishment of the new accommodation model.  This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. The funding model will be launched in the coming months. </p><p>- The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.  DCEDIY and the Housing Agency are using the allocation key to identify suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation.</p><p>- The Housing Agency has proceeded to source a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation and has acquired an initial number to date. Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.</p><p>- Work is also moving ahead on developing the system of income support that applicants will receive when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment. </p><p>- The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection. Work is being finalised to determine the respective roles of Local Authorities and NGOs in delivering the new integration model</p><p>- Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;</p><p>- A number of stakeholders meetings were held in the early part of 2022 including a briefing of the NGO sector which I was delighted to attend. Over 30 organisations were in attendance and were provided with a comprehensive update on how the implementation of the White Paper is progressing. Further briefings with the NGO sector will be held periodically. </p><p>- of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper. Work will continue in 2022 to develop further, other avenues to ensure communities are fully briefed on implementation of the White Paper.</p><p>While the Ukraine crisis has delayed implementation of the White Paper, with key members of the Transition Team redeployed to the Ukraine response, work is now resuming on the White Paper implementation.  The focus will be on implementing key elements of the White Paper model between now and year end. In the coming months, my Department will review the implementation of the White Paper to take account of the significant impact of the Ukraine migration crisis.</p><p>The implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for my department.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme and reap the benefits of high quality early learning and care. </p>  <p>  Where AIM Level 7 support is granted, additional capitation is provided to the pre-school service to either reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room from approximately 1:11 to 1:8 or to buy in additional assistance.  Level 7 is not a 1:1 support (nor is it an SNA support) but it is a shared resource with other children to facilitate optimal participation for the child who has additional needs. </p>  <p>  When AIM was introduced in 2016, the maximum weekly AIM Level 7 capitation rate was &euro;195 (equivalent to approximately 3 ECCE places at the standard ECCE capitation rate at the time). The maximum weekly AIM Level 7 capitation rate was increased to &euro;240 in 2021 to align with an increase in the ECCE capitation rate in 2018.</p>  <p>  From September 2022, Core Funding will be rolled out. Core Funding will, among other objectives, support providers to meet the requirements of any Employment Regulation Orders that result from the work of the Joint Labour Commission (JLC).  It is understood that the JLC is continuing to meet, with a view to agreeing proposals. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will provide additional funding to the overwhelming majority of providers delivering the ECCE programme, as well as providers more broadly. My Department is currently reviewing the AIM Level 7 capitation rate in light of this, with a view to maintaining the level of funding that is sufficient to achieve its policy objectives.</p></reply>

Under this expanded Programme children were eligible to enrol in the Programme at age three, and remain in Programme until they transitioned primary school  (or reached 5 years 6 months).</p><p>In line with a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the ECCE Programme was expanded again. Since September 2018, children qualify for two years of pre-school under this Programme and can enrol when they are 2 years and 8 months of age  in September in the year they enrol and continue until they transfer to primary school (or reach 5 years 6 months). </p><p>Since introduction, the ECCE programme has enjoyed high participation rates, with more than 95% of the eligible cohort benefitting from the programme.  </p><p>The <b>Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)</b>was introduced in 2016, to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities/additional needs in the ECCE Programme. AIM involves 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the early learning and care setting. Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme.</p><p>More than 4,000 children with disabilities/additional needs receive targeted AIM supports every year, and many other children are benefitting from universal AIM supports.</p><p>First 5 committed to undertake an evaluation of AIM and subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, to consider enhancements to, and/or extension of, AIM to, for example, all early learning and care services, all school-age childcare services and to children with additional needs other than a disability. The AIM evaluation is close to completion and the report is due to be published in quarter 3 of this year. The findings from the evaluation will inform further development of AIM, as committed to in First 5.</p><p>The <b>Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme</b>is an area-based prevention and early intervention initiative which is delivered in 12 areas of significant socioeconomic disadvantage across the country through Tusla&rsquo;s Prevention Partnership and Family Support (PPFS) services. The ABC Programme works in partnership with families, practitioners, communities and national stakeholders to deliver better outcomes for children and families living in areas where poverty is deeply entrenched. My Department is currently funding Tusla to scale proven models from the ABC programme under the What Works prevention and early intervention initiative. Work is underway identifying the locations for these in areas of deprivation across Ireland.</p><p>In addition to supports provided by my Department, the State supports early intervention for children with special educational needs through the following: </p><p>- Early Intervention classes in mainstream and special schools  </p><p>- Early Intervention settings in HSE funded service providers </p><p>- Early intervention settings supported by HSE grant aid or HSE funded Pre-School Assistant. </p><p>- Home Tuition Grant Scheme for children aged between 3 and 4 years of age with a diagnosis of autism where a placement in an Early Intervention setting is not available.</p></reply>

The NCCIS has greatly improved the integrity of the data collected. It has facilitated greater consistency to the interpretation of data and has provided scope for additional data to be gathered. However, there are some limitations to how the data can be interpreted, given the relative newness of this national system.</p>  <p>  Looking across the years 2014 to 2021 there has been a notable increase in the number of referrals received by Tusla. Referrals rose by 30% from 2014 to 2019, however there was very little increase across the years 2017 to 2019. This is of interest as mandated reporting commenced in December 2017. The introduction of the NCCIS in 2017 and 2018 may explain some of the increase observed between 2016 and the years 2017 &ndash; 2019. During that time, and with the NCCIS being new, areas were counting referrals differently. Some areas were counting all referrals received, even if they were deemed not to require a social work response, while other areas were only counting referrals that required a social work response following screening. </p>  <p>  There was a significant increase in referrals between 2019 (56,561) and 2020 (69,712). It is also likely that fewer referrals than expected were received in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated closure of schools and other services for certain periods of time. However, to understand this increase it is important to highlight the change in the methodology for counting of referrals that was introduced in 2020. This change means that since then all areas now count all referrals, including those which are screened out. This provides a better account of activity and demand on child protection and welfare services but has inflated the number of referrals. </p>  <p>  Analysis of the source of referrals shows an increase across the majority of sources between 2020 and 2021 and although it is difficult to say for certain, there may be particular reasons as to why. For example, an increase in referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be due to Garda&iacute; being more attuned to the issues of domestic and gender-based violence leading them to increase the number of referrals made. Increases from safeguarding officers, psychologists, teachers and some others are likely due to the increasing awareness and understanding of abuse combined with the obligations under mandatory reporting.</p>  <p>  Tusla has begun to collect data on re-referral and this data indicates a re-referral rate of approximately 20%, which is in line with international trends. This data indicates that for the vast majority of children and families referred to Tusla, once their interaction with the Agency is completed no further intervention is required or requested.</p>  <p>Given the nuances of referral data and significant changes which have occurred in recent times (i.e., introduction of NCCIS and the Covid-19 pandemic) it is difficult to comment with any certainty on the reason for increase in referrals at this time.

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for children under 2.</p><p>Lower demand for early learning and childcare owing to Covid-19 gave rise to unprecedented vacancy rates in 2020 and 2021, with data from June 2021 revealing an overall vacancy rate of 21% and vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years of 20% and 10% respectively.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the data captured by City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) and Pobal over April and May of this year reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13% and the vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years 14% and 6% respectively. The vacancy rates in Dublin for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years are shown below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Vacancy Rate   by Age</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Under 1 </td>       <td>Age 1-2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>13.5%</td>       <td>6.0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire   Rathdown</td>       <td>9.2%</td>       <td>4.8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>16.3%</td>       <td>8.3%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>15.9%</td>       <td>6.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National</td>       <td>14.1%</td>       <td>6.0%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The network of 30 CCC across the country, including CCC in Dublin, are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. CCC are also proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of undersupply. </p><p>In addition to this, a range of steps are being taken to address issues of under supply. My Department has been allocated some &euro;70m in the National Development Plan for early learning and childcare, the majority of which has been earmarked for new places. Work is underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Early Learning and Childcare Services, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The new Core Funding Scheme, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. This means higher levels of funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher. I am hopefully this new approach to funding will encourage services to operate baby and toddler rooms, where demand exists. With regard to home-based early learning and childcare specifically, the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028, which I published in 2021, sets out a plan for extending State support and regulation to childminding on a phased basis by 2028, with accelerated access to subsidies for childminders through the National Childcare Scheme. The Action Plan will involve opening up funding schemes to childminders, minding children in their own homes as well as providing dedicated funding to support childminders to meet registration and regulatory requirements. </p><p>Parents currently experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

I sought priority drafting of the Bill to ensure that it can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. I also referred the draft Heads of Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny and requested their assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver this Scheme for survivors as soon as possible.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. </p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.</p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. When the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past four months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation.

Tulsa ensures that the staff are properly qualified, that they are Garda vetted and that the premises are fit for purpose.  </p><p>If an ELC or SAC moves to a new premises they are required to notify Tulsa to enable them to inspect the premises to ensure that they are appropriate for use as an early learning and childcare centre, including that they have to appropriate planning permission, fire safety certificate and that the proposed  number of children is appropriate. A change of address nullifies Tulsa registration.</p><p>The service must also inform Pobal, the scheme administrator, by updating Pobal's Hive platform, as set out in the funding agreements for my Department's funding schemes, as set out below:</p><p><i>In the case of a change of address of a service, the service must ensure the new address/premises is registered with Tusla and then the service must log onto the Hive with all relevant details in order to request a new Service Reference number. </i></p><p>The childcare service referred to in the question moved to a new premises without notifying Tusla or Pobal.  This meant that the service was operating on a unregistered basis.  Scheme funding cannot be paid to services which are not Tulsa registered, to ensure the quality and safety of early learning and childcare services.</p><p>When my Department became aware of that the service was operating on an unregistered basis scheme funding was suspended, as is the normal practice.

Inspection reports are published on www.gov.ie/en/publication/534c2-ipas-inspection-reports/. </p>  <p>  As you may know, a vulnerability assessment pilot programme is overseen by a dedicated Resident Welfare Team within the IPAS of my Department. IPAS makes a written offer of a vulnerability assessment to all persons who make an application for international protection to the International Protection Office (IPO). Applicants in IPAS accommodation centres are assisted in filling out and returning letters by support services working on site, such as the Peter Mc Verry Trust and DePaul. </p>  <p>  Assessments begin with an initial interview with a Vulnerability Assessment Officer from the Resident Welfare Team. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. </p>  <p>  IPAS endeavour to accommodate the needs of applicants who have been deemed vulnerable within the meaning of the reception recast conditions in so far as possible, and to take all appropriate actions required to address those needs. It is the policy of IPAS to consider any identified vulnerabilities in allocating accommodation to applicants, within the overall constraints of the accommodation available. This means that it is not always possible for IPAS to address all identified vulnerabilities optimally when allocating accommodation, however where possible, IPAS will improve the alignment between accommodation and vulnerabilities as more appropriate accommodation becomes available. </p>  <p>  As vulnerabilities can manifest themselves at any stage of the international protection process, all applicants are advised that they can contact IPAS to discuss their needs at any stage, even if a vulnerability assessment has previously been conducted. Although the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) accommodation portfolio is currently operating at full capacity, IPAS is always available to deal with any complaints from residents. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, if a resident wishes to make a complaint that person should email the IPAS helpdesk directly at ipasinbox@equality.gov.ie. Where a complaint is significant in nature or a resident is not comfortable raising a complaint with a centre manager, they may make the complaint directly, or through a representative authorised to act on their behalf, to the IPAS Customer Service Team.</p>  <p>  There is an open and fair complaints procedure set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants. In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how their complaint is dealt with, they have full access to the services of the Ombudsman. In addition, a dedicated Customer Services Team has also been established in IPAS and, as well as strengthening the existing resident complaints system, this team will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through customer feedback mechanisms and focus groups in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  To provide further support to all residents, a confidential Freephone telephone support service is available. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). If a resident wishes, a complaint made through this service may be passed, in confidence, to IPAS for investigation and resolution. All residents have access to this independent support helpline. IPAS is working to facilitate clinics at centres, in line with public health restrictions. The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) helpline contact number is 1800 929 00 or you can email: info@jrs.ie.</p>  <p>  While the system is under considerable pressure because of accommodation scarcity, IPAS is working actively to seek to mitigate negative impacts for those currently accommodated by it.</p></reply>

However, legislative and budgetary responsibility for the scheme continues to lie with the Department of Finance, in the same manner that responsibility for the parameters and delivery of all transport measures and schemes operated by members of the Review Group continue to lie with the relevant department or agency. In that sense, any decision regarding the parameters of the Disabled Drivers and Passenger Scheme is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  I chaired the most recent meeting of the Transport Working Group at the end of January 2022. The current focus of the Group's work is on scoping the provision of transport supports across government departments and public bodies, with a view to assessing gaps or anomalies in provision. Following the January meeting my Department requested information from Group members on the array of transport measures and supports currently being provided.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.3033.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400112#WRFFF03300"><p>Improving early learning and childcare affordability for parents is a key priority, along with increasing quality and accessibility for children.</p>  <p>  Significant investment is being made by my Department to support parents with the costs of paying for early learning and childcare and to support providers with the costs of delivering early learning and childcare.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme is currently supporting thousands of families to offset their costs.  A recent review of the NCS showed that: </p>  <p>  - 38% of families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs covered by the NCS; </p>  <p>  - 56% of families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and  </p>  <p>  - 28% of families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. </p>  <p>  I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and accessibility. The major programmes funded by my Department that contribute to affordability and accessibility for parents include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).</p>  <p>  The universal ECCE pre-school programme provides for free access to early learning and childcare for 15 hours per week for the two years before children start primary school.  This significantly offsets the costs to parents of early learning and childcare at this stage.</p>  <p>  An estimated 95% children in the relevant age cohort participate in this programme.</p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model provides a range of both universal and targeted measures, to support children with disabilities to take part in the ECCE pre-school programme in mainstream settings, and to help make pre-school services more accessible and inclusive &ndash; benefiting all children in those services.</p>  <p>  The NCS provides universal and income-assessed subsidies to parents. A universal subsidy for children up to three is available for up to 45 hours per week.  An income-assessed subsidy is available for children of all ages for up to 45 hours per week, the level of which is determined by the family&rsquo;s income.  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector examined the current model and made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.</p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce are key objectives of Core Funding, along with improving services' sustainability. </p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15 and this will come into effect for the new programme year.  Budget 2022 also changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined, essentially offering greater numbers of subsidised hours to families where not all parents are in work or study.  This change is already in effect. The Expert Group report also recommended increasing the NCS rates and this will also be implemented for future years.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p>  <p>  As outlined, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability and accessibility for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years which I plan to build on further.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.3038.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400112#WRFFF03800"><p>The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, stipulates that the allowance payable to foster carers and relatives shall not be less than an amount specified by the Minister.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance was last increased on January 1st 2009. Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. </p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.   </p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it.</p></reply>

I have sought priority drafting of the Bill to ensure that it can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. I have also referred the draft Heads of Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny, again requesting their assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver this Scheme for survivors as soon as possible.</p><p>In accordance with the draft Heads of Bill, a person will be eligible for an enhanced medical card if they were resident in a relevant institution for six months or more. The card will provide access to the same suite of services offered to those who hold the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-Gratia Scheme medical card. The decision to provide an enhanced medical card to those who spent 6 months or more in an institution was taken by Government as it is felt that those who spent longest in these institutions will likely have endured more negative impacts on their health and wellbeing and are also more likely to be at the older end of the broad spectrum of survivors. This ties in with ensuring that access to health services is determined based on need. </p><p>For those eligible applicants who live outside of Ireland, they will have the choice to accept a once-off health support payment of &euro;3000 instead of the medical card, if they wish. This would be in recognition of, and as a contribution towards, their individual health needs. </p><p>It is also important to note that beyond the plans for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme, and through the broader <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions</i>, counselling support has been made available to all survivors since before the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s Final Report. That service has been strengthened with additional investment and an expanded out of hours service. In addition, the Department of Health, in partnership with the HSE, is working on establishing a Patient Advocacy Liaison Service. When up and running, that service will have a dedicated team who can provide bespoke information and support to survivors to assist them in accessing health services which they may need. The Department of Health is also working with the Health Research Board on a research project to identify the health needs of survivors. This research will help to further inform future health policy and service responses.</p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. </p><p>Ireland's approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.</p><p>I recognise the importance of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD. As the Deputy will be aware, the Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a commitment in the Programme for Government, following the State's first review period before the UN Committee. </p><p>Due to delays at UN level, Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the Committee will now be delayed, possibly for some time. In light of this, both Minister O'Gorman and I have indicated that we are open to earlier ratification, contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is reflective of the State&rsquo;s longstanding approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith, and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p><p>In that regard, we know that commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is required before ratification can occur, and for closer alignment with Article 12 of the Convention. It is intended that this important legal reform will be in place once the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill is passed into law.  <b></b></p><p>Alongside that, ratification of the Optional Protocol requires a comprehensive review of existing domestic remedies for breaches of the Convention in order to ensure the State can meet the obligations arising from the Optional Protocol. My Department is currently in the process of examining the requirements for ratification, and my officials have had engagement with our internal legal advisors on the steps required. This work is being progressed as part of the development of the UNCRPD Implementation Plan which is a priority for the second half of 2022.</p></reply>

It is based on learning that indicated the need to further enhance consistency of practice across Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. In addition, changes were also required to incorporate new legal judgements in this complex area of law and practice.  </p>  <p>  The Child Abuse Substantiation Procedure (CASP) is available on the Tusla Hub and will be effective from 27th June 2022 across all Tusla areas.   </p>  <p>  CASP will assist social workers in achieving an optimum standard of child protection practice when carrying out substantiation assessments.  Furthermore, this procedure will allow Tusla to function within the correct parameters of its legal obligations, fair procedures, and information management.  </p>  <p>  Engaging extensively in a consultation process both internally and externally was a very important step for the Agency in encompassing views from colleagues, both within Tusla and across many organisations working in this deeply complex and sensitive area including the Irish Foster Care Association and dedicated focus groups with foster carers.  This consultation process contributed significantly to the finalising of the CASP.   </p>  <p>In preparation of the implementation of CASP on 27th June 2022 a bespoke training plan is currently underway. The interactive online programme  consists of a mix of theory and skills-based practice.  It has a number of training streams for relevant staff within Tusla and  consists of both eLearning and virtual classroom training.  It includes modules on CASP, CASP Data Protection Guidance and CASP Tusla Case Management System (TCMS).  CASP training is currently underway on a phased basis for Tusla frontline and regional staff, who will have responsibility for implementing the CASP.  This training is very specific to Tusla staff as Tusla social workers fulfil their statutory responsibility to work in this difficult, sensitive and complex area, under Section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991.  It is not envisaged that Tusla will provide training to external stakeholders, of which there is a vast number from diverse backgrounds, all deeply invested in this area of work.   </p>  <p>  Tusla has commited to review the operation of CASP after 12 months of operation with stakeholders, to take account of evolving evidence-based practice and research in this area, developing case law and changes in legislation.  </p>  <p>  Tusla is mindful that there will be many questions from stakeholders in advance of CASP go-live date. Consequently, as part of its communications planning, Tusla is designing a YouTube video will provide a concise overview of the application of the CASP.</p></reply>

Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p>  <p>  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that one property, a guesthouse, provides accommodation for Ukrainian Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTP) at the address supplied on behalf of International Protection Accommodation Services.</p>  <p>  As this is commercial accommodation provision rather than a private letting, I am advised that inspection is outside the scope of Cavan County Council&rsquo;s remit.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that registration with the Residential Tenancies Board is not a requirement for this type of accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that contracted premises are required to be compliant by law with health and safety regulations and planning requirements and may be subject to inspections by a range of authorities in this regard, including the Environmental Health Office of the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority. </p>  <p>  While my Department does not have a set schedule for inspections in place it has sought on occasion for an inspection to be carried out and will continue to seek inspections to be completed in order to address any concerns.</p>  <p>  The accommodation provided to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine by this Department is temporary in its nature, and given the number of people that are being accommodated it is not possible to develop tailored solutions for individuals or families. The Deputy may wish to be aware that should any BOTP have concerns over the standard of accommodation provided, they may raise it with the service accommodation provider in the first instance.</p>  <p>  Information on amounts payable to accommodation providers are not currently provided by my Department in the interest of addressing matters of commercial sensitivity.</p></reply>

It is not however an Oireachtas Working Group.</p>  <p>  Action 104 of the NDIS commits that a review will be conducted of existing transport schemes, and a coordinated plan will be developed to enhance the options for transport to work or employment for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Transport Working Group has met twice, with the first meeting taking place in March 2020 and the second meeting taking place in January 2022. The work of the group was paused for a time during the pandemic, to prioritise the pandemic response, while the work of the main NDIS Steering Group continued. </p>  <p>  I chaired the most recent meeting of the Transport Working Group at the end of January 2022. Draft minutes have been prepared but have not been formally adopted by the Group. Minutes to date have not been published, and I have no plans to do so, having regard to the range of stakeholders present, some of whom are not public servants and attend on a voluntary basis. It would be appropriate that any potential decision regarding publication would first be put to the Group.</p>  <p>  Following engagement from my colleague the Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe T.D. last year, it was decided to use the Transport Working Group to assist with the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme. However, legislative and budgetary responsibility for the Scheme continues to lie with the Department of Finance, in the same manner that individual transport measures, supports and schemes remain the responsibility of parent departments and agencies across the Review Group's membership.</p>  <p>  The current focus of the Group's work is on scoping the provision of transport supports across government departments and public bodies, with a view to assessing gaps or anomalies in provision. A substantive amount of material has been received by my Department and is being analysed in advance of scheduling a further meeting, which will be organised in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This would generate opportunities not only for Irish enterprise but also for its research community. While the benefits of CERN membership are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be assessed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.</p><p>Based on indications received from CERN, the cost of Ireland&rsquo;s full membership at current prices would be circa &euro;14.6m annually. Full membership also entails a &lsquo;special contribution&rsquo; fee calculated as 1.25 times the cost of the full membership fee.  Based on a cost of &euro;14.6m at 2022 prices this would amount to &euro;18.2m due on the day a state becomes a full member. </p><p>To become a full member, a country must go through an obligatory &lsquo;associate membership in the pre-stage to membership&rsquo; phase for a minimum of two and maximum of five years. In this case, the initial annual membership fee must be at least 25% of full membership cost, and should increase to 100% by the first year of full membership. This would mean the cost of membership could go from &euro;3.7m initially to &euro;14.6m during the agreed phase of associate membership as a pre-stage to full membership.</p><p>Associate membership is also possible indefinitely, with a minimum membership fee of &euro;1.46 million per annum, based on 10% of the full membership cost. Associate membership at a higher percentage of the full membership cost is also possible. In the case of associate membership, the return to Ireland would be capped at the same level as the amount invested. </p><p>CERN membership will be considered in the context of the programme for government, national investment priorities and the evolving COVID-19 and economic situation.  Ireland continues its consideration of full and associate CERN membership and my Department remains in contact with CERN officials.</p></reply>

Therefore, apprenticeships are not a direct cost to the exchequer. </p><p>In 2019, the last pre-Covid full year, registrations were at 6,177. 2020 saw 5,326 registrations, and by 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations. The associated expenditure for those years was &euro;160m in 2019, &euro;184m in 2020, and &euro;198m in 2021. The 2022 budget allocation for apprenticeship is &euro;206m. </p><p>Regarding the employer incentivisation scheme the most recent figures available on costs are from the start of April.  The total number of employer applications validated up to 4<sup>th</sup>April 2022 was 5859, covering a total of 8762 apprentices representing a potential value of &euro;17.524m.  </p><p>Calculating a cost-per-apprentice is a complex matter involving fixed costs, such as programme development costs, and variable costs per participating apprentice. The nature of specific apprenticeships is also an influencing factor. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a Spending Review of Apprenticeships in 2019.  This estimated the average annual cost per apprentice in craft apprenticeships at &euro;7,159 and &euro;9,877 for consortia-led programmes.  </p><p>[igees.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Review-of-Participation-and-Costs-of-Apprenticeships.pdf]</p><p>The scheduling of the next update to this review is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

It is therefore not possible to definitively calculate the costs sought.</p><p>To provide the Deputy with an indication of the potential costs associated with increased places the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has provided the following estimate. Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), the estimated cost of a 10% increase in full-time undergraduate students (excluding Non-EU fee paying students) is c.156,000,000 &ndash; &euro;188,000,000. This based on an average cost of &euro;10,000 - &euro;12,000 per student. Please note this estimate excludes any additional costings which may be met by other agencies or departments.</p><p>In terms of student numbers in the specific undergraduate courses queried the HEA provided the below estimates: </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments where Social Work (or equivalent) is included in the title of the programme (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.34 additional social work student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time and part-time enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students) where counselling and psychotherapy is included in the title of the programmes, a 10% increase  would create c.25 additional student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate programmes where nutrition and dietetics is included in the title of the programmes, a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.128 additional nutrition and dietetic student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 all full-time programmes where paramedic is included in the title of the programme, a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.36 additional student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU enrolments) where medical science and biomedical science is included in the title of the programme, a 10% increase would create c.53 additional student places </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase would create c.70 additional pharmacy student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase would create c.195 additional psychology (undergraduate Level 8 honours degree programmes where psychology is included in the title of the programme) student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.39 occupational therapy student places.</p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.61 additional physiotherapy student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.35 additional speech and language therapy student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.28 additional dentistry student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.714 additional nursing and midwifery student places. </p><p>- Based on 2020/21 full-time undergraduate enrolments (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), a 10% increase in enrolments would create c.347 additional undergraduate medicine student places.</p></reply>

The grant is allocated as a block grant and the internal allocation is a matter for each institution. </p>  <p>  In terms of clinical psychology places, my Department understands there is a longstanding arrangement in place under which the HSE recruit Trainee Clinical Psychologists and sponsor their training in order to encourage employment with the HSE of suitably qualified professionals. This arrangement is made by the HSE and is not the responsibility of my Department.  The question of any costs associated with increasing the number of such funded places are matters for consideration by the appropriate recruiting bodies.</p>  <p>  In terms of student numbers, I can advise that, based on 2020/21 full-time postgraduate clinical psychology enrolments  (excluding Non-EU fee paying students), the Higher Education Authority (HEA) estimate a 10% increase would create c.19  additional student places.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2022, I secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022.</p><p>In this regard, I have already prioritised improvements to the income thresholds and student grant rates for the 2022/23 academic year, as follows: </p><p>- An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance grant. </p><p>- The income thresholds to qualify for the standard rates of student grant have been increased by &euro;1,000. </p><p>- The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p><p>I officially launched the report of the review of the Student Grant Scheme on May 4<sup>th</sup>2022 and am committed to implementing the recommendations in a phased way.As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the issue of education costs in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly across society. This summer in advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that these applicants are given every opportunity to follow an educational path that works for them I am seeking both to create additional college places in areas of identified skills need, and to broaden the national conversation on third level options.</p>  <p>  I requested that my officials engage with the higher education sector on the creation of additional places in key areas as identified by our skills architecture. These engagements are at an advanced stage, and we hope to create places in areas of acute skills need such as healthcare, construction and green skills.</p>  <p>  However increasing places is only one part of the answer.

There are also a wide range of other excellent further education and training options available to learners.   </p>  <p>  Information on the options available in further education, higher education and apprenticeship are all available on the CAO website at cao.ie/options, and I encourage anyone who is looking to take the next step in their educational journey to have a look and consider all the possibilities open to them.</p></reply>

Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life. </p><p>Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent. </p><p>My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the: </p><p>- NUIG Active Consent Programme </p><p>- UCC Bystander Training </p><p>- Speak Out report and support online platform </p><p>- The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWC in conjunction with USI. </p><p>My Department is also partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community. </p><p>My Department has also provided a number of actions for inclusion in the Third Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy which my colleague Minister McEntee will be publishing shortly. </p><p>The creation of an institutional campus culture in each of our higher education institutions which is safe, respectful and supportive, is a key priority for me. I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

HEIs were also advised to make provision for the sustainability of any supports funded under this allocation.</p><p>The HEA has advised my department that the impacts of the funding has led to: </p><p>- increased capacity for students to avail of mental health services, especially in the provision of one-to-one sessions, and also, access to psychologists and in some institutions, to psychiatrists; </p><p>- additional and significant provisions offered, including webinars, group sessions, online forums and the development of regular newsletters and e-zines, as well as increased social media presence; </p><p>- innovative outreach events and workshops in the areas of consent, suicide prevention and addictive behaviours; </p><p>- HEIs developing systems and structures for improving services and other activities. For example, in larger institutions, case management and triaging processes have been implemented; </p><p>- HEI staff being able to avail of training sessions on mental health, thereby, raising the profile internally within HEIs of what services and supports are available for students.</p><p>A number of National Projects have also been implemented with funding provided for Mental Health and Wellbeing. These have produced dedicated tools, focused research and professional collaboration, which will support staff, augment policy-making and the effective targeting of resources across the sector to achieve the high standards set by the respective student well-being, consent and suicide prevention frameworks.</p><p>One such project is the 'Speak Out reporting tool' which was created as part of the implementation of the Framework for Consent, which I launched on 19 October 2021. The tool allows HEIs to understand staff and student experiences of sexual harassment and violence and assists institutions, the HEA and my department in making evidence-based policy decisions in this area. Most importantly, it raises awareness of the supports available to students and staff and encourages them to seek help if they need it.</p><p>In late 2020, I launched the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. It recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support them and respond through working proactively. The Framework provides clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties.</p></reply>

I must acknowledge the generosity of those working in the sector, who are assisting my Department to identify and respond to the needs of displaced students and staff. </p>  <p>  The outbreak of the war occurred well into the second semester, and therefore, enrolling in programmes at that point of the year would not have been very productive.  Work is underway to determine demand arising from the displacement of Ukrainian students, as well as the type of provision required.  It is also important to note that many of the Ukrainian HEIs have moved their resources online, which has enabled students to maintain their links with their home universities.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the National Student and Researcher (NSR) Helpdesk is central to determining the demand which will arise.  It is currently gathering data on enquiries made to all HEIs in Ireland, as well as those made directly the Helpdesk itself.  This will allow my Department to get a picture of the level of demand for places.</p></reply>

It aims to support the personal, educational and professional development of the participating students. While historically administered by the Higher Education Authority (HEA), responsibility for the Fund in the further education and training sector transferred to SOLAS during 2020. SOLAS provides FSD funding to the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) who independently manage the funding allocations to PLC further education providers for services and accommodations required to support students with disabilities. Funding can be used to provide a range of supports and accommodations including non-medical helpers such as personal assistants and notetakers.</p>  <p>  Need assessments determine the supports and accommodations requested for students and the individual ETB/ further education college is responsible for decisions on the most appropriate support to meet the needs of the student, in accordance with the guidelines issued by SOLAS.  </p>  <p>  As noted in the SOLAS Guidelines, where an ETB or further education college employs personnel to deliver supports to individual students, responsibility for the terms of employment rests with the individual ETB / further education college. </p>  <p>  The detail sought on the number of personal assistants employed by ETBs under the Fund for Students with Disabilities is being requested from the ETBs and will be forwarded to the Deputy when received.</p></reply>

We recognise that the quality of our researchers is fundamental to the quality of our research system and its collaboration with partners in industry and policymakers, both in Ireland and abroad. The strategy also highlights the need to foster an environment within the research and innovation community that supports our ambition to be an Island of Inclusion and Engagement.</p><p>A stipend is a well-established feature of funded postgraduate awards globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. My Department&rsquo;s agency, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) does not currently collect data on the costs of PhD stipends to higher education institutions. </p><p>With regard to the total cost of stipends to higher education institutions and their average value, there are many ways in which PhD education is financed. By way of illustration, the most recent Higher Education Expenditure on Research and Development (HERD) Survey 2018/19 carried out by my Department, found that there were 10,044 research students (doctoral and masters by research) in 2018, of which 3,901 (39%) were fully self-funded. The majority of PhD students are in receipt of grants from their individual institutions and other research funders such as the Irish Research Council (IRC), Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  </p><p>Our priority under <i>Impact 2030</i>is to ensure a consistent research student experience, regardless of funding source.  This reflects the National Framework for Doctoral Education which is being advanced by the associated National Advisory Forum which is co-chaired by two of my agencies: the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>My Department monitors the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to the competitive research funding agencies under the aegis of my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In that regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarships by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%, from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both competitive funding agencies within my Department, i.e. the IRC and SFI.</p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2021, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;18,500 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme 2021.</p><p>Other research funders in the national system include the Health Research Board and Teagasc. There are also typically a number of PhDs funded through European Programmes and individual HEI schemes. My Department allocates recurrent funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions and as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.</p><p>Research students in receipt of grants must comply with the terms of their funding award from these bodies, which can vary from funder to funder.</p></reply>

It is also important to say that this technology would only assist Garda&iacute; in making decisions.  Automated decision making that can adversely affect a citizen&rsquo;s rights will be prohibited.

These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p>  <p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our laws and values should reflect this. I will shortly, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill which will legislate against hate crime and hate speech and ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all.</p>  <p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.</p>  <p>  The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender.</p>  <p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions.</p>  <p>  Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a number of specific operations in Dublin City aimed at addressing anti-social activity. The operations involve increased uniform and plain clothes proactive patrolling of the city, with a particular emphasis on the city centre.</p>  <p>  Operation Citizen, established in November 2021, is a co-ordinated approach involving Garda&iacute; from both Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central and North Central with an emphasis on providing high-visibility policing in the city centre to provide reassurance to the public and proactively tackle incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that, as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to hate crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provides assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded hate crimes / incidents on PULSE and social media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.</p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of Hate Crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Following a review of this pilot event, the confirmation of the applicant identity and the celebratory aspects of the ceremony were decoupled.</p>  <p>  As a result, the affidavit process that I introduced as a temporary measure has afforded over 15,000 applicants the opportunity to receive their citizenship certificates since January 2021.</p>  <p>  The upcoming, in-person citizenship ceremony, scheduled for 20 June 2022, is the first since the pandemic. It will see both the applicant identity and the celebratory aspects combined into an integrated process - which is operationally more efficient. For example, prior to the pandemic, when applicants were invited to an in-person ceremony over 95% attended, whereas when an affidavit request issues approximately 75% of cases are concluded. As a result, my Department currently has a significant number of applications on hand where the processing of the application by the Department has been completed, but have not been concluded.</p>  <p>  That said, I am very mindful of the need to balance the number of citizenship ceremonies and the operational efficiency of the entire process.</p>  <p>  Planning for additional ceremonies in December 2022 is currently underway, and these plans will be informed by the June ceremony.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.

The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  It is open to the applicant to contact the Citizenship Division of my Department at: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie at any time for an update on their application.</p></reply>

As such, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department currently has no responsibility for the matters raised in this query.</p><p>Furthermore, the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the enforcement of any legislation is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. Under Section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business. This includes all operational policing matters, including engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any third party on any matter related to law enforcement or the detection, prevention, prosecution and investigation of criminal offences. I have no role in these independent functions.</p><p>However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. Additionally, Justice Plan 2022 commits to continuing the work already commenced by my Department to establish a Gambling Regulatory Authority.</p><p>To give effect to this commitment, work is underway on the Gambling Regulation Bill, which was approved by Government for priority drafting and publication.</p><p>The Bill will set out the framework and legislative basis for the establishment of a new independent, statutory body &ndash; the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland. Among its key objectives, the Authority will require safeguards to address problem gambling including in relation to gambling advertising.</p><p>As provided for in the Bill, the Authority will develop codes and regulations in relation to advertising, promotion and sponsorship by licence holders, providing for a comprehensive and far reaching set of checks and balances in respect of gambling advertising.</p><p>These codes and regulations include measures to address:</p><p>- where, when and the form in which advertising may be broadcast, published, or displayed;</p><p>- the times gambling advertising can appear on television, radio, on-demand audio-visual media services and video-sharing platform services each day;</p><p>- the frequency and volume of gambling advertising generally;</p><p>- a prohibition on the use of material that would appeal to children in gambling related advertisements; and</p><p>- the prohibition of targeted and unsolicited advertising of gambling across a range of media and technology platforms except where a person has given their consent to receive it.</p><p>These codes and regulations will be developed in co-operation with relevant statutory bodies concerning broadcasting and advertising, and following consultation with licence holders or their representatives.</p><p>There is a pathway mapped for this legislation progressing, which will facilitate the Authority being established and operational in 2023.</p></reply>

The  Prison Service aims to provide prisoners with access to the same scope and quality of health services available under the General Medical Card scheme in the wider community.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the specific information on the average waiting time for an inmate in the Midlands Prison with special dietary needs to attend a dietician from date of a prison referral to the date of attendance is not recorded centrally. Extracting this information from the Prisoner Healthcare Management System would require a manual examination of individual prisoner records which would take an inordinate amount of time and staff resources.</p>  <p>  If a prisoner is referred by the health care team in the Midlands Prison to the Health Services Executive for a dietetic review, the process is then managed by the Executive. The average waiting time to attend a consultation with a dietician would be equivalent to patients with similar needs in the wider community.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service caters daily to the nutritional needs of approximately 4,000 prisoners in it's custody. Under the Prisons Vote, funding is provided on a broad basis to meets the costs of catering for prisoners in all prisons and with a range of dietary requirements. Within the Service, provision is made for annual catering budgets for each prison to cater for all diets. Prisons are transitory in nature and dietary requirements will vary on a weekly and/or daily basis. The Prison Service Catering Service provides a nutritionally balanced, varied diet to all prisoners through the 28 day menu which also caters for vegetarian and special diets. The menu is kept under active review and is designed to deliver 2,500 calories for men and 2000 calories for women, in line with FSAI guidelines.</p></reply>

As such, the restoration of physical visits to Cloverhill Prison was deferred at the time given the low vaccination acceptance in the prison which was significantly less than other prisons across the estate.</p>  <p>  I can advise that physical visits recommenced at Cloverhill Prison in September, 2021, and all prisoners, with the exception of those in quarantine or isolation for Covid-19 reasons, have access to physical visits.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has recently updated its quarantine procedures for new committals and as a result, new committals are now tested on the day of arrival and if a negative test result is returned they can enter general population on day four.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service worked in partnership with the National Ambulance Service and the Health Service Executive since Covid-19 vaccinations became available to administer, as swiftly as possible, vaccinations to all those eligible and who consented to be vaccinated.</p>  <p>  Whilst the idea has been to strive for maximum uptake of the vaccine, the reality in Cloverhill Prison is that the uptake was significantly less than in most other Prison Service locations. All prisoners arriving at Cloverhill, are canvassed for their vaccination status and arrangements are put in place to facilitate their vaccination schedule at the earliest opportunity. Currently the Prison Service accommodates first, second and both booster doses of the vaccine as clinically indicated and the Service works in conjunction with the HSE to ensure that the individual&rsquo;s vaccine status is co-ordinated from both a pre and post custody perspective.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in this regards.</p><p>I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are acutely aware of the importance of respecting neurodiversity and of the training needs which Garda&iacute; require in order to provide an appropriate service to autistic people, people with ADHD, with acquired brain injury and any other condition which may not be immediately apparent. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strives to provide an comprehensive and inclusive policing service, focused on community policing, and in their engagement with members of the public, all Garda&iacute; are alert to the need to recognise potential neurodiversity and respond respectfully and appropriately.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's e-learning Human Rights module, there are 5 sessions available to undertake on the Garda Learning Management System (LMS). These 5 sessions include:</p> <blockquote> 	- Session 1: Unconscious Bias<br /><br />- Session 2: Autism Spectrum Disorder<br /><br />- Session 3: Hidden Disability - Neuro Diversity Deep Dive &amp;amp; ADHD<br /><br />- Session 4: Mental Health Awareness and <br /><br />- Session 5: Suicide Prevention &amp;amp; Intervention. </blockquote>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that all Garda trainees complete the BA in Applied Policing programme. The programme's Community Centred Policing module aims to equip the students with the personal and professional expertise to proactively police Ireland's diverse community.</p><p>I am advised that the programme is delivered in a blended learning approach using Problem Based Learning (PBL). I am also advised that the content in the programme is designed to replicate real life Garda Investigations and covers the following themes:</p> <blockquote> 	1. Community Centred Policing <br /><br />2. Roads Policing <br /><br />3. Investigative Policing <br /><br />4. Officer and Public Safety and<br /><br />5. Professional Competence. </blockquote>  <p>I understand that there are modules covering a range of relevant general skills including communication and the use of the Garda Decision Making Model.</p><p>I also understand that as part of Phase 1 of the Community Centred Policing Module, there is an emphasis on an understanding of theoretical issues relating to a broad range of communities and vulnerable persons, and the application of strategies to support the delivery of a community policing service.</p><p>Phase 1 of the Community Centred Policing Module also builds on skills to allow a deeper engagement and interaction between Garda&iacute; and community members. This understanding allows for Trainee Garda&iacute; to recognise not only those at risk but all sectors of the community that may benefit from Garda presence, involvement and support.</p><p>Regarding autism awareness specifically, I am informed that AsIAm, Ireland's National Autism Charity Group, has delivered a presentation to approximately 200 students. AsIAm also delivered training workshops on how individuals can support the Autistic community by making their organisations, clubs, communities and educational institutes, autism friendly. I am informed that the feedback was very positive from the sessions and pleased to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have contacted AsIAm with a view to using an e-learning module on these matters for Trainee Garda&iacute; into the future.</p></reply>

This includes the recruitment and training of all Garda members and staff.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are several legislative measures to protect the rights of people with disabilities. For example, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2015 prohibit discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment in access to services. These Acts require An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take reasonable accommodation steps for people with disabilities, particularly in circumstances where they may require specialist or specific facilities, arrangements, services or assistance.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Stations) Regulations, 1987, make provision for a series of procedural safeguards with respect to the treatment in custody and questioning of children and otherwise vulnerable detainees. The scope of the Treatment of Persons in Custody Regulations in 1987 was focused on the creation and maintenance of the custody record. The regulations provide that a parent, guardian, spouse, relative or other responsible person can be contacted, where appropriate, when a person with a disability (as referred to in the Regulations) is arrested.</p>  <p>  In order to safeguard the rights of adult detainees who the member in charge suspects or knows to have an invisible disability, Regulation 22(2) expressly provides that where the member in charge arranges for the presence of &ldquo;some other responsible adult other than a member&rdquo;, the responsible adult should, where practicable, be a person who has appropriate experience.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Garda Human Rights Section conducted a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Custody Record Risk Assessment Form to evaluate its effectiveness. The recommendations made following this review have been considered in line with the obligations of Ireland pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), to furnish persons with a disability with effective access to justice on an equal basis with others, and to provide them with appropriate special facilities where necessary to allow them to realise this right.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently in the process of compiling a revised Risk and Vulnerability Assessment to further their commitment to safeguarding the rights and needs of any person who is vulnerable or has a disability. This will ensure a consistent approach to the provision of supports and services for vulnerable people interacting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, protecting their Human Rights.</p></reply>

Visa processing times for the Ankara Visa Office are published online by the Department of Foreign Affairs at <i>www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/turkey/visas/visas-for-ireland-weekly-decisions-report/</i></p><p>The Ankara Visa Office has seen a more than 50% increase in visa applications received in the year to date to the end of May 2022 in comparison with the same period in 2019 (before COVID-19 related travel restrictions). Long stay study visas accounting for more than 60% of those being received in 2022. In addition to this increase in applications, the Ankara Visa Office has received an extremely high number of incomplete applications, which is also adding to the longer processing times, given the resources that have to go into examining these applications.</p><p>The processing time at each Visa Office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as: the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result. </p><p>Every effort is made to keep visa processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland, including in the Ankara Visa Office. This includes the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review. </p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account. </p></reply>

If at any time a prisoner displays any signs and symptoms of hepatitis they are reviewed by a member of the Prison Healthcare Team and managed appropriately. </p>  <p>  The National Hepatitis C Strategy and Treatment Programme aims to provide fair and equitable treatment in a timely manner to all those who require Hepatitis C treatment. In that regard, a number of treatment models have been developed, including a hospital treatment model and a community treatment model. If a prisoner, in any prison, requires treatment for Hepatitis C they are referred to specialist services in the acute hospital sector and necessary treatment is provided under the hospital treatment model, by relevant specialist clinical teams.</p>  <p>  To support this model of service for those in the custody of the Prison Service, specific arrangements for the screening and treatment of Hepatitis C are in place in a number of prisons (Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Mountjoy, Dochas Centre and Midlands), whereby in-reach Hepatology services are provided on site in those prisons, by specialist teams from St James&rsquo;s Hospital. In the remaining prisons, those requiring treatment attend the specialist services in the hospital setting.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service continues to work with the HSE and the National Clinical Hepatitis C Lead to develop and implement a prison treatment model of care, which will replicate the community treatment model in a prison setting, initially in those prisons where this service is currently not available. This will facilitate the provision of treatment, to those who meet the criteria for that model of care, by the primary healthcare team in the prison. </p>  <p>  Arrangements were agreed to progress a pilot prison treatment model in Cork Prison but unfortunately, due to resource issues, it was not possible to progress the pilot as planned. Prisoners who require this treatment continue to be managed under the hospital treatment model.  It is anticipated, however, that the required resources will shortly be in place to facilitate the provision of Hepatitis C treatment, to those eligible for same, by the primary care team in Cork Prison. It is hoped to advance this programme in Cork Prison later this year. </p>  <p>  In time, it is anticipated that all those who can be appropriately treated for Hepatitis C by the primary care team in the prison will be treated under that model, while those who require specialist care will continue to be referred to the acute hospital setting. </p></reply>

Ireland, as part of a coordinated group of State Parties, submitted a joint referral to the Office of the ICC Prosecutor on 1 March 2022 and the ICC Prosecutor has initiated an investigation. The Prosecutor has established a dedicated portal through which relevant information may be submitted. Ireland will fully cooperate with this investigation pursuant to the International Criminal Court Act 2006.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Kampala Amendments to the Rome Statute, the International Criminal Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction in Ukraine does not extend to the crime of aggression.  Work is ongoing at an international level to consider how to address this limitation and to ensure accountability for such crimes. Ireland is actively following developments in this regard. Should domestic legislation be required as a result of this work it will be considered as a priority. Separately, work is continuing between the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General to fully implement the Kampala Amendments in domestic law.</p></reply>

Long stay study visas account for more than 60% of those being received in 2022. In addition to this increase in applications, the Ankara Visa Office has received an extremely high number of incomplete applications, which is also adding to the longer processing times, given the resources that have to go into examining these applications.</p><p>The processing time at each Visa Office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as: the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result. </p><p>Visa required individuals who wish to study a third level or English language programme in Ireland for a period longer than three months, must apply for a Type D Long Stay visa. All visa applicants are advised that they must provide as much information as possible in support of their application as this will improve their prospect of receiving a positive decision. Further details on the application process are available on my Department&rsquo;s immigration website at:</p><p><i>www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study-options/</i></p><p>When an applicant arrives at the port of entry, they must provide evidence to the Immigration Officer that they have immediate access to at least &euro;7,000. This is the estimated cost of living in Ireland for a student for one academic year. </p><p>If the duration of the course is less than six months, they must have access to &euro;500 per month of their stay or &euro;3,000, whichever is the lesser. All of this must be proven by documentary evidence and, where sponsors are involved, it must be clear their documents relate to them.</p><p>More information on the required finances for students coming to Ireland can be found at: </p><p><i>www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study-options/a-fee-paying-private-primary-or-secondary-school/information-on-student-finances/</i></p></reply>

There is a need for anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism purposes to have reasonable certainty that the person is who they say they are. The common standard as set out in the guidelines issued by the Central Bank is that customers undertaking certain transactions present official Government-issued photographic identification. </p>  <p>  A driver&rsquo;s licence or passport are acceptable documents in this regard. In order to verify the customer&rsquo;s identity, proof of address is sought in the form of a utility bill, bank statement or official correspondence. Under the legislation, there is an onus on designated businesses to gather this information prior to carrying out a transaction (e.g. prior to a customer being able to collect gambling winnings of a certain value.) </p>  <p>  Where a customer indicates that they don&rsquo;t have any official government issued photographic identification such as a driving licence or passport, the customer may as an alternative complete an ML10 form available from a Garda station which a Garda can sign on behalf of an applicant to confirm their identity. </p>  <p>  The designated business may accept this along with proof of address as an alternative. ML10 forms may be processed by any Garda station. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that a review of the ML10 Form is currently underway. </p>  <p>  The Banking Payments Federation of Ireland also publish guidance on documents that may be acceptable for the purposes of identification and verification in the context of customer due diligence. The guidance is available on their website via the following link - Final-BPFI-Guide-to-Opening-Bank-Accounts-in-Ireland-for-Protection-Applicants-Final.pdf .</p>  <p>  It indicates that while passport and EU or Irish driving licence are accepted as standard forms of proof of identity, a bank will accept alternative documents as proof of identity, if the applicant does not have either a passport or a driving licence. These include, for example: Irish Residence Permit; Temporary Residence Certificate or Irish Government Travel Document (UN Issued.)</p></reply>

However, my Department endeavours to deal with them as closely as possible to chronological order. The initial registration and assessment of applications are dealt with chronologically, however, depending on the information provided and the timing of responses for additional or missing documentation, applications may not then be concluded chronologically. </p><p>Given the volume of new applications received in the last two and a half years and the issues caused by the pandemic, the volume of cases backlogged had increased exponentially. However, steps have been taken by my Department to address this and to mitigate the risk of something similar happening again. </p><p>The EU Treaty Rights Division of my Department have implemented a two pronged approach, whereby one team processes backlogged cases as a priority and a second team processes new applications chronologically to ensure they do not add to the backlog. This ensures that older cases are getting resolved as quickly as possible, while ensuring new applications received, where all information is provided, do not exceed the six month statutory time limit. </p><p>This new approach has led to a marked increase in decisions made by the Permanent Residence Unit and a significant reduction in backlogged cases and the number of days applicants are waiting for a decision.</p><p>Applicants for Permanent Residence are advised to submit their applications six months before the expiry date of their current permission. Therefore, in most cases, the issue of a temporary stamp 4 is not necessary immediately. However, in cases where an applicant requires a temporary stamp 4 while their application is being considered, this will issue within two weeks of receipt of the application and is valid for an initial period of nine months. </p><p>Applicants who hold a registered temporary stamp 4 are eligible to leave and re-enter the State, subject to any visa requirements that may be attributable either in the State to which they are travelling or on their return to this State. Applicants should advise the EU Treaty Rights Division of any intended absence from the State during this period as correspondence may issue or further documents may be sought in relation to their application. </p></reply>

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty, which is necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration. The exercise of powers in this area is at all times subject to the law and to respect for individual rights.</p><p>The Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department has responsibility for front-line immigration duties at Dublin Airport only. Other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p><p>The Border Management Unit operates on a 24/7 basis. There are eight teams comprising of 17 Immigration Control Officers, rostered across four shifts and deployed to the two Terminals.</p><p>Given that arrivals are not evenly dispersed throughout the day, the BMU officers carry out a range of immigration duties and are allocated across various immigration points as required. </p><p>The allocation of immigration personnel is designed to maximise the number of immigration booths operating to address demand during peak periods. This is further supported by automated eGates. </p><p>Under Section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004, an Immigration Officer must determine whether a non-EEA national should be granted leave to land and thus gain entry to the State. In performing their duties, an Immigration Officer is required to consider all of the circumstances of the non-EEA national at the time of entry.</p><p>A refusal of leave to land by the BMU is first considered by the Immigration Officer and is always signed off by a more senior officer. There is no appeal process, but it is important to note that a refusal of leave to land, unlike a deportation or a removal order, is specific to the arrival instance and does not preclude the person from seeking to enter the State in the future if they satisfy the conditions for entry. The principle of non-refoulement applies to these decisions.</p><p>If a person indicates or is identified as being in need of international protection, they are admitted to the international protection process. However, they will still be recorded as a refusal of leave to land.</p><p>The following table sets out the number of persons refused leave to land, and, of those, the number who claimed asylum at Dublin Airport on the dates requested: <table>    <tr>       <th>Date </th>       <th>No. of Refusals</th>       <th>Of whom claimed Asylum</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>02-Jun-22 </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>03-Jun-22 </td>       <td>28 </td>       <td>26 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>04-Jun-22 </td>       <td>30 </td>       <td>29 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>05-Jun-22 </td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>06-Jun-22 </td>       <td>25 </td>       <td>24 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>07-Jun-22 </td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>08-Jun-22 </td>       <td>46</td>       <td>41 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>09-Jun-22 </td>       <td>29 </td>       <td>28 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The APS is employed by DAA and authorised by the Minister for Transport under the Airport and Air Navigation Acts. Airport Police duties include responding to emergency situations, traffic management and dealing with the preservation of good order to ensure all users of State airports can enjoy a safe environment while working or travelling through the airports.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the deployment of Garda members to operational policing duties is a matter for the Garda Commissioner by law and that, as Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dublin Airport station is part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.

These acts provide for the licensing and operation of bookmakers, including betting by remote means, and for the control and regulation of gaming and lottery activities. </p><p>Gaming as understood by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, does not include the provision of games and lotteries by remote means, such as online or via apps. In that context , the Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. </p><p>The Government has approved the Gambling Regulation Bill for priority drafting and publication, and drafting is under way. Importantly, the Bill will address the currently fragmented legislative framework in relation to gambling in the State and the regulation of same.  To achieve this, the Bill will introduce a modernised and streamlined licensing framework to reflect the nature of gambling in the State, with new types of licences for both in-person and online / remote betting as follows:</p><p>- Business to Consumer Gaming, Betting and Lottery Licences;</p><p>- Business to Business Licences; and</p><p>- Gambling licences for Charitable/Philanthropic Causes.</p><p>This approach is based on the recommendations of both the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling and the Final report on the establishment of a modern regulatory environment and authority for all gambling activities licensed in Ireland. These reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website as follows: </p><p>- <i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/IDWG-Report-on-Future-Licensing-and-Regulation-of-Gambling.pdf/Files/IDWG-Report-on-Future-Licensing-and-Regulation-of-Gambling.pdf </i></p><p>- <i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Final-Report-on-Gambling-Regulation.pdf/Files/Final-Report-on-Gambling-Regulation.pdf</i></p><p>The Bill includes provisions to ensure that the Authority will have the necessary powers to enforce the licensing regime with statutory power to impose a range of appropriate sanctions. </p><p>There is a pathway mapped for this legislation progressing which, with the cooperation of the Houses of the Oireachtas, will facilitate the Authority being established and operational in 2023.  </p><p>Recruitment of the CEO Designate is also underway through an open Public Appointments Service competition.</p><p>A Programme Board has been established in my Department to ensure that the legislation and the operational preparations are progressed in parallel so that the Authority commences operations as soon as possible after enactment.</p></reply>

These extensions were made in the context of an uncertain health and international travel situation to provide assistance and assurance to people who use our immigration services.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I announced the most recent measure to provide clarity to certain groups over the summer period and provided a notice to employers that non-EEA nationals may continue to work once they can provide documentary evidence of their ongoing application to renew their immigration permission.</p></reply>

The objective of the Service is that all releases are planned in order to support offenders to make informed and effective transitions from prison to the community.</p><p>I am advised that, when a sentenced prisoner informs prison authorities that they were homeless prior to coming into custody, or that they are at risk of homelessness on release, they are referred to the prison-based resettlement service. The Resettlement Service works with the prisoner and the relevant Local Authority to complete their social housing application and identify possible accommodation solutions in preparation for their release and reintegration to the community. </p><p>I am also advised that the Irish Prison Service does not record statistics in the specific format requested by the Deputy.  However, statistics are available from 2020 to date, broken down by Local Authority and these are provided in the tables below. Table 1 provides details of the number of committals where the person declared that they were of &lsquo;no fixed abode&rsquo; or &lsquo;address not stated&rsquo; at the point of committal.</p><p><b>Table 1. Number of prisoners who declared homeless status on committal to prison</b></p><p>The table below sets out the number of committals who cited &lsquo;No Fixed Abode&rsquo; or &lsquo;Address Not Stated&rsquo; on committal to prison. An individual can be committed on more than one occasion in a given year, for example, committed on a remand warrant in January and again on a sentence warrant in July.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>Year 2020</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>Year 2021</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>Year 2022 (up to and including 31 May 2022)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Committal<br /><br />Month</td>       <td>Remand</td>       <td>Sentence</td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>Remand</td>       <td>Sentence</td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>Remand</td>       <td>Sentence</td>       <td>Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>42</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>43</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>35</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>23</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>30</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>50</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>42</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>28</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>224</td>       <td>235</td>       <td>459</td>       <td>183</td>       <td>264</td>       <td>447</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>119</td>       <td>213</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Total Committals in Year 2020 = 6,340 </p><p>Total Committals in Year 2021 = 6,133</p><p>Total Committals in Year 2022 (up to and including 31 May) = 3,085*. </p><p>*numbers may be subject to change pending the publication of the Annual Report 2022. </p><p>Tables 2.1 to 2.3 provide details of the number of sentenced prisoners who engaged with the resettlement service prior to their release, completed an application for social housing and who were released from prison to attend public housing appointments for emergency homeless accommodation.The Prison Service advise that the application for social housing can be submitted months or days in advance of the release date dependent on the timing of the prisoner&rsquo;s voluntary declaration of homelessness, which influences opportunities for response.  </p><p>These tables do not include prisoners on remand, or prisoners who did not declare their homeless status to prison authorities prior to release, or prisoners who choose not to avail of the assistance of the resettlement service, as this information is not available. </p><p><b>2.

Where the total number of people of any given country of origin is less than five, no further breakdown is provided to protect the identity of the people concerned. </p><p>I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and during all levels of public health restrictions. </p><p>It should be noted that last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015, and this work has continued apace in 2022.</p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. </p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  </p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p><p>I am also pleased to confirm that my Department will host the first in-person citizenship ceremony since the pandemic on 20 June 2022, with further ceremonies scheduled in December 2022, in Killarney. <table>    <tr>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.3482.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400121#WRPPP04000"><p>The Ankara Visa Office has seen a more than 50% increase in visa applications received in the year to date to the end of May 2022 in comparison with the same period in 2019 (before Covid-19 related travel restrictions). Long stay study visas account for more than 60% of those being received in 2022. In addition to this increase in applications, the Ankara Visa Office has received an extremely high number of incomplete applications, which is also adding to the longer processing times, given the resources that have to go into examining these applications.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a large number of study applications are being withdrawn and returned to the applicants as they are incomplete and contain little or no supporting documentation. These applications are being withdrawn, instead of being refused, in order to be fair to the applicants and to give them an opportunity to resubmit their applications with all the necessary documentation.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the office in Ankara is not refusing a large percentage of English Language study applications: in fact the refusal rate for applications in 2022 to the end of May is just under 5%. This compares favourably with a refusal rate in the full year of 2021 of 2% and in 2020 of 10%.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments.

These requirements include giving notice to specified family members.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the 2015 Act makes provision for new arrangements for enduring powers of attorney. When Part 7 is commenced, new enduring powers of attorney will be required to be created in accordance with the 2015 Act. It will no longer be possible to create an enduring power under the 1996 Act once Part 7 has been commenced.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 proposes amendments to the provisions of Part 7 of the 2015 Act relating to enduring powers of attorney.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth has responsibility for matters relating to the commencement or amendment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></reply>

A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  Given the global nature of the drugs trade, international law enforcement co-operation remains a key element in the overall response. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N) based in Lisbon.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in harnessing an international coalition of support to tackle the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The success is evident by the nationwide results of Operation Tara, which has a focus to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle drug related harms.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, including drug rehabilitation programmes, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. While implementation of the strategy is led by the Department of Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department is also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence of conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals. In addition, we will continue to roll out the Greentown initiative which is designed to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.</p></reply>

The NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery, and to protect the public.  These obligations include:</p><p>- maintaining the Register of Nurses &amp;amp; Midwives, </p><p>- setting the standards for the education and training of nurses and midwives, </p><p>- approving programmes of education necessary for registration and specialisms and monitoring of these programmes on an ongoing basis, </p><p>- supporting registrants by providing appropriate guidance on professional conduct and ethics for both registered nurses and midwives, and </p><p>- conducting inquiries into complaints about registrants. </p><p>On 1 November 2021, there were 81,331 nurses and midwives on the NMBI Register.  This is the highest ever number and is 2,003 or 2.5% above the 01 November 2020 figure of 79,328 registrants. NMBI intends shortly to publish more granular details from the Register based on the data from the 2021 renewal cycle. This will provide the most up-to-date and accurate view of the Register.</p><p>In recent years, the NMBI had been dealing with an increasing volume of overseas applications to the Register. This, along with the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the work involved in transitioning to a new digital registration system (MyNMBI) had led to a backlog in processing overseas (non-EU) registration applications. </p><p>Over the past number of months, my Department has been actively engaged with the NMBI to reduce this backlog and to ensure a more streamlined process for managing overseas applications. A key milestone in the registration process is the applicant attaining a Decision Letters (DLs) from the NMBI. This allows the applicant to apply for the necessary visa, required so that they can take the final steps to secure registration. </p><p>The NMBI recognises the importance of prompt processing of all applications for registration, particularly in the current climate where additional staffing is required around the country. Intensive efforts are continuing to expedite the processing of these overseas applications and several new measures are being undertaken by NMBI including: </p><p>- Additional resources, including staffing. Currently, there are 26 staff in the NMBI&rsquo;s Registrationdepartment; in 2021 there were 14 staff members,</p><p>- Process improvements, </p><p>- Applicant input and collaboration, </p><p>- Updated NMBI guidance, and </p><p>- Stakeholder communication and collaboration.  </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these measures are having a positive effect across the various stages of the process with the increase in the number of DLs in particular demonstrating this.  In 2021, 2,430 DLs issued to overseas applicants, and year to date in 2022, NMBI has issued 2,253 DLs. This means that the backlog in processing overseas applications has been greatly reduced. The NMBI is now forecasting that it will issue over 5,000 DLs in 2022.  The NMBI has now reported to my Department that currently, complete applications can be processed within 90 days, which is in accordance with its key performance indicator for these applications.</p><p>Along with the NMBI, I welcome registration applications from those nurses and midwives who were educated overseas as they seek to join the health service workforce in the State.</p></reply>

Persons who hold a medical card or a GP visit card are not subject to any co-payments or other charges in respect of such services including GP consultations.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services (blood tests) is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. Clinical determinations as to whether a blood test should taken to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition are made by the GP concerned. There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for such blood tests. In addition, blood tests undertaken in the context of services provided under the GP Chronic Disease Management programme are covered by the fees paid to GPs by the HSE for this care. </p>  <p>  Where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, or has been charged for a blood test provided under the Chronic Disease Management programme, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

This information is also published monthly and is available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm.</p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

There is no longer a public health rationale or need for extensive testing, case finding and tracing of infection to reduce COVID-19 transmission. The focus now is on mitigation of the severe impacts of COVID-19 for those most vulnerable to the disease and those with risk factors who may benefit from specific interventions. Full details of the current public health advice are available on the website of the HSE at www.hse.ie.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to implement this advice which will invariably lead to consolidation of resources in fewer centres around the country as the HSE moves through transition phases of the testing and tracing programme in the months ahead. The arrangements with regard to individual test centres is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in this regard, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

They are responsible for their own scope of practice which is guided by the NMBI. There is no mandatory education or training to become a practice nurse. Ideally, practice nurses should have at least 2 years post-registration general nursing experience. However, 4 to 5 years post-graduate experience is more desirable. This enables nurses to develop their competencies in a broader clinical background.</p><p>Practice nurses may undertake further education. For example, education on:</p><p>-  respiratory management</p><p>-  diabetes management</p><p>-  cardiovascular disease management</p><p>-  women's health</p><p>-  cancer screening</p><p>-  immunisation</p><p>The HSE employs professional development coordinators for practice nursing (PDCPN) These coordinators:</p><p>-  have responsibility for the strategic development of practice nursing</p><p>-  provide guidance and direction for practice nursing</p><p>-  work as the link between the HSE and practice nurses</p><p>-  facilitate education and continuing professional and role development</p><p>-  collaborate with relevant healthcare professionals, educational bodies and other stakeholders.</p><p>The 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The Government is open to considering other options of support for general practice as part of the strategic review. The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, with preparatory work for the review having begun this year.</p><p>The Minister published the Expert Review Body on Nursing and Midwifery 2022 which is a pathway for developing and strengthening the roles of the nurse and the midwife.  It contains 47 recommendations that will support nurses and midwives to continue to learn and develop in professional roles, enabling significant reform and ensuring that critical Sl&aacute;intecare priorities are realised. One of the recommendations will require the identification and development of clinical nurse/midwifery specialist and advanced nursing/midwifery practice career pathways to meet service demands in community and primary care settings. The Chief Nursing Office in my Department is currently exploring options in relation to the provision of education programmes for practice nurses.</p></reply>

They have also played a central role in the national vaccination rollout &ndash; the largest ever undertaken by the state.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland. </p><p>The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. These discussions will bring clarity to the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. The central objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is providing the right care, in the right place, at the right time. This means providing more care to patients in the communities in which they live. Community pharmacists will play a vital and increasing role in delivering this care. </p><p>The ongoing work of the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum will also prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p><p>I believe there is a real opportunity to work collaboratively, and with other healthcare providers, to make a significant difference to patient outcomes.

In particular, I fully acknowledge that community optometrists have played a key role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the pandemic optometrists have been responsive to the challenges presented and have developed guidelines and procedures to safely deliver patient care. I also recognise that optometrists have also played an important role in the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Optometrists have the potential to play a greater role, and my officials are working with their counterparts in the HSE with a view to contracting more services from acute and community settings out to community optometrists.The current contract with Optometrists dates back to 1999 and it is accepted that it is has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years, including the recommendations from the 2017 Primary Care Eye Services Review Group Report, interdisciplinary collaboration.  I am fully committed to the development of community services which can facilitate expanded and more integrated provision of eye care in local communities. In this context, a contractual relationship between optometrists and the HSE which is modernised to emphasise a strengthened primary care system will be required.Any publicly funded service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.Subject to available resources, the 2022 priorities for the HSE are to support the Primary Care Eye Teams in CHOs 6, 7 and 9 in rolling out a team model and to advance the transfer of care for children aged 8+ years to local optometrists.</p></reply>

It is intended that the Contract will be introduced following engagement with the representative bodies, the IMO and the IHCA. When the date of implementation of the new Contract is set, the new consultant contract will apply to all consultant appointment offers from that date.</p></reply>

This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card. Since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that the next stage of the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under, namely, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7, will be commenced this year.  Consultations with the IMO, representing GPs, are ongoing in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) provides for the refund of the amount by which expenditure on approved prescribed medicines or medical and surgical appliances exceeds a named threshold in any calendar month. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2022, the DPS threshold was reduced to &euro;100 per month. On 1 March 2022, the DPS threshold was further reduced the DPS threshold to &euro;80. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. The combined effect of those two reductions in the DPS threshold will be an annual minimum saving of &euro;408, or 30%, for any individual or household that regularly exceeded the 2021 threshold of &euro;114. In addition, there have been almost 37,000 additional claimants under the DPS since these reductions were introduced.</p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations prescribed 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Prescription charges do not apply to persons who qualify for the LTI scheme.</p>  <p>  A review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. The current priority has been on access to GP services and a review of hospital charges.</p>  <p>  Funding was provided in Budget 2022 for measures to alleviate the financial burden of statutory hospital charges incurred for children accessing care in a public hospital. This allocation of funding follows on from the commitment given in the Programme for Government to abolish statutory acute public in-patient charges for children over the lifetime of the Government. It is my intention to bring the necessary legislation before the Oireachtas this year.</p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Eligibility is to be expanded on a phased basis in line with GP capacity so as not limit the ability of general practice to meet the needs of all patients in the community. As such there is currently no timeline for universal GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  Measures taken by the Government to increase GP capacity and the number of GPs in the State are already having an impact. There has been a significant increase in the number of GPs entering training in recent years, up from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with large increases made in recent years. The transfer of responsibility for training to the ICGP, completed last year, will result in further increases in the coming years. 258 GP training places are planned for 2022.</p></reply>

Currently 2.1 million people in Ireland have access to free GP care through the Medical Card and GP Visit Card schemes. The Programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the expansion of universal care in a fair and affordable manner, including the expansion of GP Visit Cards to children. Talks are currently underway on the implementation of free GP care for children aged 6 and 7, which will have a meaningful impact on the cost of living for impacted households. In line with Sl&aacute;intecare and Programme for Government commitments to the expansion of universal care, the Department of Health is currently exploring options for further expanding eligibility to GP services in a fair and affordable manner.</p></reply>

Very significant funding of &euro;77 million has been provided by Government across 2021 and 2022, to increase national capacity to 340 critical care beds by 2023. The HSE has advised that 51 of these beds are now open, bringing permanent adult critical care capacity to 306 beds, from a baseline of 255 beds in early 2020.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which I brought to Government in December 2020, will when implemented fully address the recommendation of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review for 430 critical care beds by 2031. In fact, it surpasses that recommendation, delivering an increase in capacity to 446 over time.</p>  <p>  Importantly, capacity expansion in critical care is focused on the larger &ldquo;hub&rdquo; hospitals, in line with the clinical advice and hub and spoke model of care for critical care. The funding provided in 2021 and 2022 has allowed for the opening of eight additional critical care beds in Saolta University Health Care Group, including six beds in University Hospital Galway, one in Sligo University Hospital and one in Letterkenny University Hospital. </p>  <p>  The provision of additional critical care capacity in accordance with the hub-and-spoke model of care also reflects the overall strategic direction of Sl&aacute;intecare - delivery of the right care, in the right place at the right time.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p></reply>

However, the support of public health and ICT was required and, due to COVID-19 pandemic, this work could not be continued and funding was returned.</p>  <p>  The development of a national diabetes registry remains a priority. Following substantial increases in investment in eHealth, the national diabetes registry is now being considered as part of a wider review of Ireland&rsquo;s health information strategy, and will operate as a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registry.</p>  <p>  Government approval was given in April to prepare the General Scheme of a Health Information Bill. It is envisaged that the Bill will include a provision to enable the operation of disease-specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry, where information on disease diagnoses and treatment from healthcare providers is efficiently collated, combined and quality-checked from administrative records to create a database akin to an active registry for each disease.

This funding has been maintained into 2022.  Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment. This has been affected due to the strategic workforce challenges in the home support sector. I have established an Advisory Group to identify the specific obstacles to recruiting carers and make recommendations by this September. </p>  <p>  Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to 286 in March 2022.   This has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of additional funding to address those waiting.  However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.  At the end of March there were 5,458 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. In January 2020, there was about 1,300 people in this category. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 5,744 at the end of March.  </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to advertise on an on-going basis throughout the region for Health Care Support Assistants and to recruit as many suitable candidates as possible.  Due to the nature of the role, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level.   </p></reply>

Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes.  </p>  <p>  The independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020 and the Expert Panel&rsquo;s report, published in August 2020, outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. The report also makes a series of recommendations in relation to broader reform of older persons&rsquo; care. Work is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel. Three progress reports have been published, while a fourth progress report is due to be published shortly. All progress reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.gov.ie/en/publication/c7f5b-covid-19-nursing-homes-expert-panel-report-implementation-oversight-team/). </p>  <p>  One area of reform recommended by the Expert Panel relates to a review of the nursing home regulatory regime. In March 2022, Government approval was granted to draft a General Scheme for a Bill to provide interim enhancements to the regulatory framework in relation to compliance mechanisms and data collection. A wider review of the nursing home regulatory model will commence in the second half of 2022 which will be informed by an international evidence review and stakeholder consultation. </p>  <p>  My Department is also examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector, and in tandem with this work, the Patient Advocacy Service (PAS), which currently supports residents in HSE-operated nursing homes to make complaints, will begin its rollout to private nursing homes at the end of 2022.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will be undertaken which will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past 2 years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type of emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be. </p></reply>

Ireland views Hepatitis C as a public health threat and is committed to the WHO target of eliminating it by 2030. </p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) in 2015 and began the process of providing treatment for Hepatitis C using Directly Acting Antivirals to patients prioritised according to clinical need. </p>  <p>  Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment across a range of healthcare settings to all persons living with Hepatitis C in Ireland. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in accordance with the WHO target, to eliminate it in Ireland by 2030. In order to achieve this, the NHCTP has been allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP works in partnership with the Irish Prison Service nationally, and with Hospital and community teams, to provide outreach to all prisoners that require treatment for Hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  Since its inception in 2015, the NHCTP has treated over 6,600 patients with Hepatitis C virus. The focus has been in the east of the country as the evidence to date has indicated that this is where the highest population needing Hepatitis C treatment has resided. The NHCTP&rsquo;s Community Prescribing Project has been developed to widen the availability of the Hepatitis C treatment to enable GPs to treat people who are on opioid substitution treatment across the country. The Community Prescribing Project will expand in the future to be available for people not on the opioid substitution treatment scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition, an online home testing option is currently being scoped by the NHCTP and will expand the testing and treatment to people who are currently undiagnosed. It is anticipated that this will be available later this year. The NHCTP will utilise all possible treatment options and the medical needs of individuals identified will dictate which care pathway is best. Treatment will remain free to people regardless of where the service is delivered. The NHCTP will develop a communication plan to support the rollout of the home testing service later this year.  This communication plan will also aim to destigmatise the testing and treatment associated with Hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP reports that it is very much still on track to eliminate the Hepatitis C virus in Ireland by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) conducted a Health Technology Assessment regarding the feasibility of national birth cohort screening for the Hepatitis C virus. HIQA published the results of that Health Technology Assessment in 2021. It recommended a national program of birth cohort testing for Hepatitis C for people in Ireland born between 1965 and 1985.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA, the NHCTP is currently carrying out a national sero-prevalence study to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in that Irish birth cohort (i.e., those born between 1965 and 1985).  The study is being carried out using residual sera from tests sent in by general practitioners (GPs). To date 6,000 samples have been analysed and the results are expected by the end of July 2022. This study will give indications of what percentage of the population have the Hepatitis C virus, but all indications are that the remaining number of people to be treated are low.  </p></reply>

It is a key enabler and effective means of linking those with mental health difficulties to community-based supports and interventions through the local Voluntary and Community Sector.  </p><p>Social isolation, fear and loneliness and (typically) associated inactivity, have negative consequences for both physical and mental health and can particularly impact older age groups, those with chronic health problems, people with mental health difficulties and psychosocial needs, carers, single parents, migrant and immigrant and minority ethnic groups. </p><p>In recognition of the supports that social prescribing can provide, the Programme for Government, 2020, Our Shared Future, includes a commitment to &quot;<i>Seek to expand social prescribing where patients are referred to non-clinical activities, as a means of positively influencing mental wellbeing</i>&quot;.</p><p>Last year, I was pleased to launch the HSE's Social Prescribing Framework, which commits to mainstreaming and integrating social prescribing within Community Healthcare Networks across the country. </p><p>The Framework is providing, and will continue to provide, strategic guidance and direction to the further development and sustainability of social prescribing. </p><p>There are currently 31 HSE funded social prescribing services across the country. 19 of these are Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities sites; some of the other services were formerly funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund and mainstreamed within the HSE through the 2022 Estimates process. The services are delivered by community and voluntary organisations through grant aid agreements with the HSE. </p><p>With regard to the detailed information sought, as these are service matters I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  While there are no current plans to extend the list of illnesses covered, the LTI scheme will be included in a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. It is not possible to say at this juncture what the results of this review will be.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for those who are not deemed eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.  </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%</p></reply>

However, Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run, and staff in these organisations are not public servants. Their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the HSE conducted a data gathering exercise in relation to an agreed list of 50 pilot organisations. The results of this analysis formed the basis of an engagement, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission. It showed that of those that returned data, different measures were taken in different organisations to achieve savings &ndash; in some places pay was cut, in others pay was not cut. In a number of instances, pay had already been restored.</p>  <p>  An agreement was reached by the parties in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by the 50 pilot agencies. Pay restoration commenced in April 2019 with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000.  Any outstanding balance was paid in 2020 and 2021. A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021, and the third and final payment due to be made in 2023.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Eligible Section 39 organisations included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. There is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that the process has reached a final resolution. As such, I am not in a position to provide detail on costs associated with introducing pay restoration for Section 39 organisations which fell outside of the 250 organisations included in the initial WRC agreement.</p></reply>

Ireland views Hepatitis C as a public health threat and is committed to the WHO target of eliminating it by 2030. </p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) in 2015 and began the process of providing treatment for Hepatitis C using Directly Acting Antivirals to patients prioritised according to clinical need. </p>  <p>  Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment across a range of healthcare settings to all persons living with Hepatitis C in Ireland. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in accordance with the WHO target, to eliminate it in Ireland by 2030. In order to achieve this, the NHCTP has been allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP works in partnership with the Irish Prison Service nationally, and with Hospital and community teams, to provide outreach to all prisoners that require treatment for Hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  Since its inception in 2015, the NHCTP has treated over 6,600 patients with Hepatitis C virus. The focus has been in the east of the country as the evidence to date has indicated that this is where the highest population needing Hepatitis C treatment has resided. The NHCTP&rsquo;s Community Prescribing Project has been developed to widen the availability of the Hepatitis C treatment to enable GPs to treat people who are on opioid substitution treatment across the country. The Community Prescribing Project will expand in the future to be available for people not on the opioid substitution treatment scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition, an online home testing option is currently being scoped by the NHCTP and will expand the testing and treatment to people who are currently undiagnosed. It is anticipated that this will be available later this year. The NHCTP will utilise all possible treatment options and the medical needs of individuals identified will dictate which care pathway is best. Treatment will remain free to people regardless of where the service is delivered. The NHCTP will develop a communication plan to support the rollout of the home testing service later this year.  This communication plan will also aim to destigmatise the testing and treatment associated with Hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP reports that it is very much still on track to eliminate the Hepatitis C virus in Ireland by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) conducted a Health Technology Assessment regarding the feasibility of national birth cohort screening for the Hepatitis C virus. HIQA published the results of that Health Technology Assessment in 2021. It recommended a national program of birth cohort testing for Hepatitis C for people in Ireland born between 1965 and 1985.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA, the NHCTP is currently carrying out a national sero-prevalence study to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in that Irish birth cohort (i.e., those born between 1965 and 1985).  The study is being carried out using residual sera from tests sent in by general practitioners (GPs). To date 6,000 samples have been analysed and the results are expected by the end of July 2022. This study will give indications of what percentage of the population have the Hepatitis C virus, but all indications are that the remaining number of people to be treated are low.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-14a.4090.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061400132#WRAAAA03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1564 to 1566, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) developed a broad range of national ethical and clinical guidance throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic with a view to supporting healthcare workers, managers, and policy makers as they navigated their way through the ethical challenges and difficult decisions they were called upon to make during this challenging time.</p><p>The <i>Ethical Framework for Decision Making in a Pandemic</i>and the supporting documents produced by the Department clearly articulate the importance of fairness, inclusiveness, proportionality, and non-discrimination, all of which are enshrined Human Rights principles. Further guidance issued on the delivery and provision of healthcare matters in a pandemic and in long-term residential care services include <i>Ethical Considerations Relating to Long-Term Residential Care Facilities in the context of COVID-19</i>; <i>Preliminary Clinical and Infection Control Guidance for COVID-19 in nurse-led Residential Care Facilities (RCF)</i>; and <i>Anticipatory Prescribing in the Last Hours or Days of Life</i>. The purpose of these guidance documents is to support clinicians in their care of patients and service users, including in respect of the making of appropriate clinical decisions. Such decisions, on the provision of healthcare or the transfer to another healthcare facility, are arrived at in consultation between the clinical experts and the resident or his or her representative, and in recognition of the needs and wishes of the resident. This is in line with the relevant guidance which notes that the transfer of residents to hospital is only appropriate where this will confer additional benefit and that decisions to transfer should be made in conjunction with the person, their families and their advanced care plans.</p><p>All grades of nursing work within a Scope of Practice Framework, set out by the regulator of the profession (the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland - NMBI). The scope of practice sets out the procedures, actions and processes that the registered nurse is allowed to perform. Scope of practice for nurses and midwives in Ireland is determined by legislation, European Union (EU) directives, international developments, social policy, national and local guidelines, education and the individual practitioner&rsquo;s levels of competence. There have been many changes and developments in the Irish health service and in nursing and midwifery roles. These include changes in systems of care provision, reforms in professional education and expansion of the scope of nursing and midwifery practice roles to meet patient needs. Factors such as the practice setting and collaborative practice can influence a nurse&rsquo;s scope of practice.</p><p>The prescribing of medicinal products is an expanded role that nurses and midwives undertake following successful completion of an approved education programme and having regard to legislation, professional regulation and national and local health service provider policies, procedures and guidelines. Each registered nurse must prescribe within their scope of practice and is individually accountable to keep up-to-date with advances in medicinal product prescribing and clinical practice and must acknowledge any limitations in their competence. The scope and context of practice should be determined with reference to the Scope of Nursing and Midwifery Practice Framework (NMBI, 2015) and the Practice Standards and Guidelines for Prescriptive Authority (NMBI, 2019) that a registered nurse should adhere to as part of their professional responsibilities. The relevant medicines legislation, associated regulations, national and health service provider policies, procedures and guidelines must inform prescribing practice of the registered nurse. The clinical governance for the prescribing of medicinal products is now determined by the local health service provider.</p><p>Finally, nursing home providers have a legal duty to ensure the provision of appropriate medical and health care to residents, and to ensure appropriate care and comfort is provided to a resident approaching the end of his or her life. This is set out in the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, under Regulations 6 and 13 respectively.</p></reply>

I recognise how difficult it has been for people living in nursing homes and their families throughout the pandemic. </p>  <p>   I am fully committed to the continued improvement of older persons services, including long term residential care. To this end, there has been significant learnings from the experience and impact of COVID-19 on nursing homes, and more generally, and these learnings are informing a wide-ranging programme of reform which was recommended in the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will be undertaken which will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past 2 years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type of emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Health established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group in January 2022. The Expert Group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically. It is important that we have a strong and robust embedded public health system into the future.</p></reply>

Very significant funding of &euro;77 million has been provided by Government across 2021 and 2022, to increase national capacity to 340 critical care beds by 2023. The HSE has advised that capacity of 333 beds can be reached by the end of this year, with the remaining 7 beds to open in 2023.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which I brought to Government in December 2020, will when implemented fully address the recommendation of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review for 430 critical care beds by 2031. In fact, it surpasses that recommendation, delivering an increase in capacity to 446 over time.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, there were 297 permanent adult critical care beds open. A further 9 beds have opened to date in 2022, bringing capacity to 306 beds. This represents a very significant increase of 51 beds, or 20%, over the 2020 baseline of 255 beds. To put that in perspective, we had a total net increase of 18 beds in the three years 2017, 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  With regard to the average number of critical care beds open and funded in 2021, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

The units include space for the Palliative Community Homecare Team, Day Care, treatment rooms and pharmacy, family accommodation, kitchen and canteen, staff room, administration, education and meeting rooms and, where relevant,  external groundworks/landscaping. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost specifically associated with each bed.  However, as a guideline,  it should be noted that the construction costs for a 15 bed unit would be approximately &euro;15m, with fit-out costs in the region of &euro;1.5m. The revenue funding required to operate a 15 bed specialist palliative care inpatient unit is &euro;3.8m per annum which equates to &euro;253,000 per bed per year.</p>  <p>  Finally, a 50 bed unit would not be considered as the staffing levels and related revenue costs would be prohibitive and maintaining a high level of clinical care would be very challenging. The locations for new inpatient units have been identified in line with national policy and the HSE's  Pallative Care  Development Framework 2017-2019, with units ranging from 15-36 beds.</p></reply>

The<i>Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Ireland 2018 </i>(Phase 1) was launched in 2018 and <i>The Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in Adult Emergency Care Settings in Ireland 2022 </i>(Phase 2) was launched on the 2<sup></sup>June 2022 (www.gov.ie/en/collection/bebf28-taskforce-publications/). </p><p>Phase 3 of the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing in Community settings includes (i) Long-Term residential care settings for older persons, (ii) Community care settings, and (iii) Step-down and Rehabilitation settings. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently testing the first part of Phase 3 of the Safe Nurse and Skill Mix Framework in Long-Term residential care settings for older persons. Based on the evidence and in line with the recommendation of the  COVID-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel, Phase 3 (i) will, in line with other phases, be developed into a national policy for broader implementation. </p><p>Implementation of Phase 1 of the Framework is being progressed by the HSE. &euro;15m was allocated up to 2021 to fund the associated staffing costs. This delivered 543 WTE adjustments overall to date across the Model 4 Hospitals. Full implementation of the Framework continues to be a priority for me and I allocated an additional &euro;10 million for further continuation of Phase 1.</p><p>I have allocated a further &euro;0.2million in 2022, to further develop the unit, within the HSE, responsible for oversight of the national implementation plan for safe nurse staffing and skill mix.</p><p>I recently launched the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in Adult Emergency Care Settings in Ireland 2022 (Phase 2). Implementation is a key priority for me and I have allocated &euro;2.8m in Budget 2022 to the HSE to immediately commence implementation. </p><p>It is important to note the pandemic had an impact on the expected timelines associated with implementation progress of Phase 1. As part of my Department&rsquo;s oversight role of HSE, it will be monitoring implementation during 2022.  </p><p>I have provided the allocated funding in tabular form below. However, Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s request around details for estimated funding, individual settings and outstanding costs,  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p><p>Funding allocated to implement Phase 1: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Funding allocated </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NSP 2020 </td>       <td>&euro;5m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NSP 2021 </td>       <td>&euro;10m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NSP 2022 </td>       <td>&euro;10m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Funding allocated to implement Phase 2: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Funding allocated </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NSP 2022 </td>       <td>&euro;2.8m </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.</p><p>The Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 595 of 2021) reduced the DPS threshold to &euro;100 per month as of 1 January 2022.</p><p>The Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No 77 of 2022) further reduced the DPS threshold to &euro;80 per month as of 1 March 2022.</p><p>When producing models to estimate the impact of downward threshold reductions the Health Service Executive (HSE) examines the impact of previous downward changes. This requires a reasonable amount of data at each threshold change to provide some level of assurance that an estimate is reasonable, especially as the HSE does not have data on sub-threshold prescriptions. Given the recency of the DPS threshold changes, there is insufficient data available to the HSE to robustly estimate the impact of further changes. </p><p>However, preliminary data indicates that the reduction from &euro;114 to &euro;100 has benefitted between 9,553 and 12,251 families per month (on average, 10,495 families per month) and the reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 has benefitted an additional 18,943 families based on the first month of data for that change. Preliminary data further suggests the full year budget impact of the threshold change from &euro;100 to &euro;80, which came into effect on 1 March 2022, may be around &euro;20m. </p><p>Based on this first month of data, the full year estimated minimum cost of reducing the DPS threshold from the current threshold of &euro;80 per month, in increments of &euro;5, is as outlined in the below table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Proposed DPS Threshold </th>       <th>Cost of Reduction* </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;75 </td>       <td>&euro;6.5m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;70 </td>       <td>&euro;13m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;65 </td>       <td>&euro;19.5m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;60 </td>       <td>&euro;26m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This data is subject to the following caveats.  The source data used is the claiming month March 2022, the first claiming month for the new DPS threshold of &euro;80 per month. The source data is annualized to determine cost (i.e., multiplied by 12).  The costings exclude the cost for any individuals who are below the current threshold level of &euro;80 per month.  The costings exclude any impact resulting from an aging demographic.</p></reply>

The full year minimum cost of reducing the prescription charge to &euro;0.50c for eligible persons over 70 and reducing the monthly cap to &euro;5.00 per person or family, is <b>&euro;12.9m</b>.

The full year minimum cost of reducing the prescription charge to &euro;0.00c for eligible persons under 70 is <b>&euro;37.7m</b>.  The cost of removing prescription charges for all eligible persons.  Therefore, the minimum cost of abolishing prescription charges for all eligible persons would be approximately <b>&euro;63.6m</b>.</p><p>All these costings are subject to the following caveats.  The forecasted cost is based on persons with claims submitted in the period to the end of April 2022 and is annualised for a 12-month period to give the annual impact.  The reported cost does not reflect the impact of the increase in eligibility numbers experienced in April 2022 onwards resulting from the Ukrainian Support Programme.  Any reduction in or the removal of prescription charges may result in a change in client behaviour.  </p></reply>

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March 2022 &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation. My officials are continuing engagement with the HSE in relation to the necessary programmes of work required to further advance consideration of the issues arising for commencing Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care.</p></reply>

Since the emergence of Covid-19, there has been a significant increase in delays accessing routine treatment for those in target school classes. This has resulted in backlogs emerging in the targeted schools programme.</p>  <p>  In 2019 a total of 151,393 new oral health patients in target groups attended for scheduled assessment. The corresponding figure for 2020 was  55,324, in 2021 it was 82,494. The HSE is continuing to restore dental screening and treatment to children up to 16 years of age through recruitment initiatives to fill vacancies that have arisen or may arise; prioritizing clinical treatment and patient groups; and reallocating clinical resources to areas of greatest need.</p>  <p>  The national approach to future oral health service provision will be informed by Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy (2019). A new model of service for children will be introduced in accordance with the evidence and WHO recommendations. Oral healthcare packages, which will include prevention, primary care and emergency care, will be the basis of service provision for children. These oral healthcare packages will be provided in a general dental care practice. Based on costings done by the ESRI, this is expected to cost in the region of &euro;30 million.</p></reply>

This evidence threshold ensures that we can be confident that the programme in question is effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards for the population. The case for commencing or expanding a population-based screening programme is evaluated against internationally accepted criteria, and includes an examination of ethical, economic, legal and societal factors as well as the scientific evidence.</p>  <p>  Financial cost is but one factor that is considered in the decision-making process. Due to the complex nature of the evaluation process and the criteria against which a decision is made, it would be impossible to accurately quantify the cost of expanding a screening service until a full evidential assessment was completed.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to report recent progress in expanding newborn screening with a ninth condition, ADA-SCID (Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency Severe Combined Immunodeficiency), being added to the NBS programme on 23 May 2022. This important development means that all newborn babies in Ireland will now be screened, as part of the &lsquo;heel prick&rsquo; test, for this rare condition which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. Funding for this expansion was provided to the HSE in the budget.</p>  <p>  The NSAC has also commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is currently underway and includes an examination of budget impact and resource implications. I look forward to receiving a recommendation from the NSAC on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p></reply>

The CDM programme also includes case finding and an annual preventive visit for patients identified with high risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

However, Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run, and staff in these organisations are not public servants. Their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee.</p>  <p>  Staff in these section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive those cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements. While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in a pilot group of 50 section 39 organisations who are funded by way of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Pay restoration commenced in April 2019 with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000.  Any outstanding balance was paid in 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 SLA funded organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021. The third and final instalment of the Pay Restoration for the 250 eligible Section 39 organisations is due in 2023, at a projected cost of &euro;4.75m.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The list of section 39 organisations that was compiled, included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included. There is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and the process has reached a final resolution.</p></reply>

These measures include: </p><p>- the cost of the Haddington Road Agreement pay restoration; </p><p>- the extended seasonal influenza vaccination programme; </p><p>- the reduction in Drug Payment Scheme thresholds from &euro;100 to &euro;80 per month included in the government's cost of living measures; </p><p>- the extension for the full academic year of the Pandemic Placement Grant of &euro;100 per week to eligible nursing and midwifery students;</p><p>- the COVID recognition payment for eligible healthcare staff</p><p>- the purchase of COVID therapeutics medicines</p><p>- the cost of responses to the Ukraine crisis, including the issuing of additional medical cards as well as other supports;</p><p>- the addition of an extra public holiday on 18th March 2022 and the related additional costs to the health service in respect of agency/overtime.</p><p>At present, no additional net funding has been allocated to the Health Vote in respect of these measures. Additional measures sanctioned to date in 2022 have been sanctioned on the basis that where possible the expenditure is met from within the existing available Health allocation. Some of these measures are one-off in nature, while others will have an ongoing expenditure impact in future years. The allocation of permanent baseline funding for those measures which are recurring for 2023 will be considered in the context of Estimates 2023 discussions to take place between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later in 2022.</p><p>Any additional net funding requirements for the Health Vote associated with these measures for 2022 will be determined throughout 2022 and will be finalised between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of ongoing budgetary management processes. </p></reply>

Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year.</p><p>By using the capacity provided by Cappagh for less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date. Year to date by the end of May 2022, 197 scoliosis procedures had been carried out, compared to 156 for the same period in 2019. The number of patients waiting longer than 6 months for a scoliosis procedure has also reduced to 79 by the end of May, compared to 103 in August 2020.</p><p>In relation to the query raised by the Deputy, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital in 2022. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. This funding supports a WTE of 42.73 staff members as well as associated medical and surgical costs, equipment, and other non-pay related expenditure. </p><p>The source of this funding stream is the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan. As is clear from the expenditure type, this is of a committed type, rather than once off, therefore this funding stream is envisioned to be maintained in future years. While as yet the Department does not have any funding beyond 2022, and will not until Budget 2023 is agreed, the intention is to maintain this spending.  <i></i></p></reply>

The health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.  In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.  The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided at the link.</p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the NTPF to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

Both I and the Government have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services. The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS.</p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. To address the concerns of contractors about the viability of the Scheme, I am using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy. The HSE will assist anyone still experiencing problems accessing a service under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card can make enquiries directly to any dental practice they wish to access dental care. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual dentist to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a dental  practice cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other dental practices in or around the area. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Dental Council Code of Practice relating to Professional Behaviour and Ethical Conduct, dentists are required to respond to a dental emergency even if the emergency involves patients who do not normally attend their practice. All patients are eligible for high risk emergency dental care in hospitals. </p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.</p></reply>

While encouraging Member States to exercise flexibility for these professionals, the Commission recognises the continuing obligation on Member States under the Professional Qualifications Directive (Directive 2005/36/EC) to assess qualifications obtained outside the EEA. Applicants who wish to enter regulated professions must first have their qualifications and experience assessed by the appropriate regulator to see if they meet the standards required to practise the profession safely in their new state of residence. </p><p>Officials in the Department of Health form part of a coordination group established by the EU Commission examining these issues. This group shares knowledge and best practice and is examining methods to streamline and expedite registration, including the use of electronic databases, the EU information centres for academic recognition and translation tools.</p><p>My officials are working closely with colleagues in the six health profession regulators to examine ways to support Ukrainian doctors, nurses and other health practitioners arriving in the State. The regulators fully recognise the importance of assisting health practitioners arriving from the Ukraine and to this end have been implementing measures such as internal working groups, dedicated webpages, the translation of documentation and engagement with the Ukrainian embassy and Ukrainian health practitioners, amongst other measures. </p><p>Recent figures indicate that the number of applications being processed across all six regulators are very low, only five full applications have been received, however, this number is in contrast to the large number of initial enquiries being received and formal applications are, therefore, considered to rise significantly over the coming months.</p><p>Listed below are the contact details for any enquiries from those fleeing the conflict and seeking to practice a regulated profession. It is advisable for individuals to email in the first instance, the regulators will make every effort to facilitate their applications in as practical a fashion as possible and in many cases translated documents can be provided to them where required.</p><p>- Medical Council:  Ukraine@mcirl.ie, 01 4983100, medicalcouncil.ie/ukraine/ </p><p>- Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU): Ukraine@coru.ie, 01 293 3160,<b></b>coru.ie/news/news-for-the-public/applicants-from-ukraine.html</p><p>- Dental Council: info@dentalcouncil.ie, 01-6762069.</p><p>- Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland: g3reg@nmbi.ie, 01 6398500, my.nmbi.ie/</p><p>- Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland: noneuroute@psi.ie, 01 218 4006/01 2184000, </p><p>- thepsi.ie/tns/news/latest-news/22-04-13/Information_to_support_people_coming_to_Ireland_from_Ukraine.aspx</p><p>- Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC): /recognitionqualifications@phecc.ie, 045-882042/045-882074.</p><p>The Department has responsibility for the recognition of non-Irish qualifications for certain unregulated professions, in particular where the professional wishes to take up a post in the HSE (environmental health officers, clinical biochemists, audiologists, orthoptists and psychologists). The Department has not received any applications from those fleeing the conflict in the Ukraine but if any such professionals require information they should contact validation_unit@health.gov.ie or (01) 635 4057.</p><p>The Department of Health will continue to prioritise this issue and engage with the regulators and other key stakeholders.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

The development includes a dedicated Ophthalmology Injection Suite.</p>  <p>  - ULHG has also engaged with the HSE's National Women and Infants Health Programme to establish ambulatory gynaecological and fertility services in Nenagh. The ambulatory gynaecology clinic and the regional fertility hub became operational in 2022.  The ambulatory gynaecology service is expected to significantly reduce the number of patients waiting for gynaecology appointments across the Group.</p>  <p>  - ULHG recently opened newly developed inpatient accommodation at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. &lsquo;The Maigue Unit&rsquo;, is a modern, state-of-the-art 24 single room ward complex, and includes a new operating theatre suite.</p>  <p>  - In total, 98 new beds were added to UHL by the end of 2020. A suite of 24 single rooms were completed on the UHL site and there is a dedicated Haematology Oncology Unit. A separate temporary 14-bed single room block has also been completed.</p>  <p>  - The new Injury Unity in Ennis Hospital was handed over to the HSE on the 15th December 2021. The doors of the new &euro;2m Injury Unit at Ennis Hospital opened on Friday April 8th, bringing an immediate improvement in the clinical environment and experience for healthcare staff and the thousands of patients who use this service every year.</p>  <p>  - The development of the new four-storey, 96 single bed acute inpatient ward block extension at University Hospital Limerick has full planning permission, fire certification and is fully designed.  It is anticipated that the works contract will be awarded in early Quarter 2 2022 subject to HSE Board approval and funding availability.</p>  <p>  My Department and I remain committed to improving services at University Limerick Hospital Group and ensuring patient-centred care for the people of the Mid-West. The Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure services, facilities and patient experience at ULHG continue to be developed into the future. As the UHLG are responsible for the management of capacity across the Group, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is key to delivering on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. </p><p>A Government Decision on RHA Implementation was approved on 5 April. This will provide policy direction and a clear mandate for the work programme. Concurrent with this a Business Case detailing the selection process for this policy direction was published and is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4eda4-slaintecare-regional-health-areas-rhas/. </p><p>The recommended policy option is one in which the six new RHAs are implemented as separate branches of the HSE. RHAs will be set up internally as formal regional structures within the HSE to ensure national policies can be implemented consistently and disruption to the system will be minimised as we make this transition. This is in line with core Sl&aacute;intecare principles.</p><p>In keeping with lessons learned from previous health system reforms, the option approved by Government balances the need for national consistency with more regional autonomy and associated accountability closer to the frontline.</p><p>While this option does not see RHAs established as separate legal entities, RHAs will have their own budgets with the power to determine their own hiring needs. While they will operate within a national policy context, this plan seeks to devolve decision making to RHAs and their leadership teams as much as possible.</p><p>The HSE is already a legal entity with a Board under the 2004 Health Act and it is not envisioned that this will change with the introduction of RHAs. </p><p>As we seek to better integrate acute and community based care, listening to health and social care system staff will be key. I established an independent RHA Advisory Group of patient and staff representatives from across the health and social care sector. This Advisory Group will provide guidance, support, and advice on the design of an implementation plan for RHAs to the Department of Health and HSE officials charged with implementing this work programme under Sl&aacute;intecare. In addition to this group, a number of engagements with stakeholders have taken place over the past several months. More health and social care sector engagements are planned over the summer months.</p><p>All of the insights gained from these engagements will inform the overall design of RHAs. My Department is drafting a detailed implementation plan in partnership with the HSE and other key stakeholders which will cover how RHAs will impact finance, clinical and corporate governance and accountability, digital and capital infrastructure, workforce &amp;amp; HR and change, communications &amp;amp; culture. The implementation plan will set out the key objectives, actions, and deliverables for the successful implementation of RHAs. The implementation plan is currently in draft and will be finalised by the end of the year.</p><p>The high level timeframe for the establishment of RHAs is as follows:</p><p>- A detailed implementation plan will be developed in partnership with stakeholders in 2022. Implementation work will be taking place in tandem in some instances.</p><p>- A shadow budget using population-based resource allocation will be developed in 2022.</p><p>- Corporate and clinical governance frameworks will be developed and finalised in 2022.</p><p>- Transition to RHAs will begin in 2023.</p><p>- A population-based resource allocation funding model will be used as part of Estimates 2024 to allocate funding by RHA.</p><p>- By Q1 2024, the expectation is that RHAs will be fully operational.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, outlines the waiting list at University Hospital Limerick by specialty, broken down by Adult &amp;amp; Child.

This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. </p>  <p>  It may be of interest to note that the NSAC held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; in 2021, which gave the public an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones and the Committee are currently reviewing the submissions received. I will be guided by their advice to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continue to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that screening is for healthy people without symptoms. If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p>  <p>  Moreover, in 2018, the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services was established by the Minister for Health to review the delivery of cardiac services nationally. The Review seeks to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality, and sustainability of the services that patients receive.  The Review considers the delivery of all cardiac services nationally.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report with the next meeting planned for late June 2022. Any newly proposed cardiovascular health screening recommendations resulting from the Review will be subject to consideration and advise of NSAC.</p></reply>

These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community.</p>  <p>  Applications within Community Health Organisations (CHOs) are assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding available.  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items but CHOs undertake a range of initiatives to ensure optimum use of resources. </p>  <p>  Amputees, whose amputation arose from either a traumatic or elective event, usually have their primary prosthesis fitted at the hospital where the surgery was undertaken. Subsequent prostheses are provided to eligible clients through the Community Funded Schemes. Rehabilitation services are provided by the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) primarily at their site in Dun Laoghaire and augmented by a number of satellite clinics that they operate throughout the country. There are also a number of smaller services operated at regional level that provide assessment and fitting clinics along with prostheses at a local level.</p>  <p>  A HSE Primary Care led National Service Improvement Programme has the aim of improving the equity of access, value for money, and functional processes of the Community Funded Schemes through the establishment of national guidelines for the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. While this work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Programme has recommenced. A review of the current prosthetics service is underway and is due to be completed by early 2023.</p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  </p>  <p>  In terms of reducing the cost of other medications, under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Colleagues in the department and across the health sector continue to work to resolve the issues around supply of Hormone Replacement Therapies. A stakeholder meeting was held last week with representatives from the Department, HPRA and HSE to discuss and assess the supply of HRT medicines. Based on information provided by companies involved in the recent HRT shortages, we now appear to have entered a stabilisation period in supply. During this stabilisation, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. </p><p>The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p><p>The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Ensuring the adequate supply of appropriately skilled home-support workers and healthcare assistants is a key objective of this initiative.</p>  <p>  The structure and membership of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group was informed by submissions received by my Department from key stakeholders in January 2022 as well as by a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the extent of the challenges in the sector.</p>  <p>  At the inaugural meeting of the Group, which was held on 3rd March 2022, the Group's terms of reference and action-timelines were agreed. The terms of reference are available on the Department's website. Areas being considered by the Group include the recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions, and the career development of front-line carers in home-support and nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Group is currently working with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues arising and will submit a report for my consideration by September 2022.

Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the Act must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act, i.e., before January 2022. </p>  <p>  The Review is being led by an independent Chair and comprises of 2 main phases. As part of the first phase of the Review, information and evidence on the operation of the Act will be collected. There are 3 elements within the first phase of the Review; service user research, service provider research and public consultation. </p>  <p>  The second phase of the Review is being led by an independent Chair who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the 2018 Act have been achieved, analysing in that regard the findings of the three strands of information. The Minister for Health appointed Ms Marie O&rsquo;Shea B.L. as the independent Chair of the Review.</p>  <p>  A request for tender to carry out the research into the views of service providers was published on eTenders. The objective of this research is to capture the views and experiences of service providers and will be a key input to the Review of the operation of the 2018 Act. A total of five responses were received and evaluated in line with procurement guidelines. The evaluation process has now concluded, and the successful tender was chosen in line with the published award criteria. This is in line with established competitive procurement processes. </p></reply>

The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that, as the collection of diagnostic waiting list data is still under development, diagnostic waiting lists are not yet part of the National Validation Unit&rsquo;s validation programme, and the NTPF has further advised that it is unable to provide data in relation to the number of patients added to or removed from diagnostic waiting lists each month.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs on 19th April, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. </p><p>Officials in my Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. They shall shortly publish information for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p></reply>

These aids and appliances are provided by the HSE through community services known as Community Funded Schemes.</p>  <p>  Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances. Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and funding availability within local budgets.</p>  <p>  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items provided through the medical and surgical aids and appliances budget in a particular CHO. Waiting times for items approved for funding vary depending on the priority rating and priority is given to clients with the greatest level of clinical need. The HSE have advised that clinical demands on local budgets remain high.</p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. </p></reply>

A review of accruals balances had been planned by the HSE as part of the migration to the new Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and was brought forward in consultation with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s review found that while most of the recorded accruals were deemed to be valid, there was an element which were not able to be validated with a total value of &euro;71m, representing 3% of the overall current liabilities balance. This gives rise to a prior year adjustment to be booked in the 2021 financial statements. A prior year adjustment relates to a restatement in the current year&rsquo;s accounts of a balance or matter previously reported in a prior year&rsquo;s set of financial statements.</p>  <p>  The review of non-pay revenue accruals was a substantial exercise undertaken by the HSE, involving a large number of individual accruals balances, some of which were historical balances going back a number of years. Having completed this exercise, the HSE and the Department now have additional assurance that the current accruals balance recorded by the HSE is fully valid. The transition to the new Integrated Financial Management System Across the HSE, which is currently in the &lsquo;Build and Test&rsquo; phase before implementation beginning in 2023, will include a more standardised process and robust controls for the posting of financial journals (including accruals) built into the system.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs on 19th April, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. </p><p>Officials in my Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. They shall shortly publish information for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p></reply>

While every sector has specific safeguarding responsibilities for adults at risk within their remit, currently no one Department has an assigned lead or coordinating cross-sectoral role, and I note that Safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s report suggests a central role in this regard for the Department of Justice and supportive roles for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, my Department and the Departments of Social Protection, Finance, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p><p>I and my Department take the risk of abuse of vulnerable adults in healthcare and social care contexts very seriously.  In the health and social care sector, various structures and processes, including legislative and policy measures, are available to protect against abuse and ensure prompt action, including legislative and policy measures.  My Department will carefully examine Safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s important report with a view to identifying and considering its potential implications for agencies and services within the remit of my Department.  I will ask relevant officials of my Department to meet representatives of Safeguarding Ireland to discuss these implications in greater detail, with a view to informing my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to develop a national policy and related underpinning legislation on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector, building on the robust structures already in place.  This policy development work is at a very advanced stage, with details of a public consultation to be announced in the near future. </p><p>Separately, the Law Reform Commission is preparing a major report on <i>A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding</i>across all sectors, which is also expected to inform future policy and legislation on adult safeguarding. Upon completion of the Commission&rsquo;s report, all relevant Departments will consider any recommendations the Commission may make regarding legislation relevant to their Departments&rsquo; functions.  </p></reply>

In addition, similar to many other hospitals, significant numbers of staff have not been available due to COVID illness.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised me that, compounding the above, there was a fire outbreak in the Hospital&rsquo;s CIRRUS unit on 27th December 2021 which caused serious damage to that premises. This has significantly reduced options to stream COVID and non-COVID patients.  It is expected that this Unit will reopen in August which should help provide some relief to the current situation.</p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised that the presence of a 24 hour ED at the hospital impacts on its control over the number of acute patients presenting to the hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE has assured me that the hospital is making every effort to resume levels of services in the orthopaedic unit and to ensure the safe delivery of care required to those patients presenting to the Emergency Department.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy with any further updates on the matters raised. </p></reply>

Using multiple information sources, this publication outlines the prevalence of alcohol and other drug use among young people in Ireland. With this data, it examines the risk and protective factors that may encourage or discourage young people to begin using such substances, which may lead to problematic use, it also examines the consequences of drug and alcohol use, such as hospitalisations, death and crime.</p>  <p>  This important research provides valuable insights into drug and alcohol use amongst our children and young people. An understanding about the alcohol and drug use among this cohort is key to providing evidence-based prevention and education to young people at this critical juncture in their lives.</p>  <p>  The misuse of drugs and alcohol by all across society is concerning, but particularly so by young people of those of school going age. The National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery, promotes prevention initiatives regarding our young people and the misuse of drugs and alcohol. It recognises that substance misuse prevention strategies need to be evidence based and target families, schools, and communities in order to be an effective way of promoting health and well-being among the general population. </p>  <p>  The consequences of drug use can affect our young people&rsquo;s health, undermine academic engagement and, sadly, may result in serious injury and death. We know that young people are the most likely to experiment with drugs, and therefore it is important that we collectively address these issues.</p>  <p>  It is a strategic priority for the remaining period of the National Drugs Strategy to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use and the associated harms among children and young people. An implementation group has been established to focus on the progression of this priority, under the auspices of the national oversight committee.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is developing a Prevention and Education Funding Programme which will support evidence-based prevention measures. Education and awareness programmes that are delivered alongside other measures, and which build life skills and confidence, are far more likely to be effective in encouraging protective and healthy behaviour than stand-alone measures. </p>  <p>  I am committed to expanding prevention and education initiatives which support young people to lead healthy and fulfilling lives and protect them from the dangers of drug and alcohol use.</p></reply>

Using multiple information sources, this publication outlines the prevalence of alcohol and other drug use among young people in Ireland, examines the risk and protective factors that may encourage or discourage young people to begin using such substances and/or lead to problematic use, and also examines the consequences of drug and alcohol use, such as hospitalisations, death and crime. A link to this overview can be found here: www.hrb.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/HRB_Overview_Series_12.pdf</p>  <p>  The consequences of alcohol and drug use on young people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing can undermine relationships, academic engagement and, sadly, may result in serious injury and death. Young people are the most likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol, and therefore it is important that we collectively address these issues for our young people at the critical junctures in their life.</p>  <p>  A priority for the national drugs strategy for the period 2021-2025 is to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use and the associated harms among children and young people. </p>  <p>  A strategic implementation group has been set up to deliver on this priority, the national oversight committee for the national drugs strategy. It's focus is on prevention, education and awareness of drugs and alcohol use by building the skills and confidence in young people and by encouraging healthy choices and behaviour. Furthermore, the Department of Health is developing a prevention and education funding programme to encourage the development of evidence-based prevention measures on issues relating to drugs and alcohol and young people. </p>  <p>  Other measures are also being progressed. The Department of Health and the HSE have developed a pilot drug monitoring programme to be delivered by the HSE at selected music festivals, as a public health response to the harms of drug use in nightlife environments. These proposals are currently being reviewed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I look forward to working with a variety of stakeholders to progress this important work.</p>  <p>  I look forward to progressing the work of the strategic implementation group on prevention and education for young people as part of our public health approach to drug use.</p></reply>

It lays down rules for the prevention and control of animal diseases that are transmissible to animals or humans, including for diseases which are considered to pose a considerable risk of spread when animals are moved between Member States.</p>  <p>  The provisions of this Regulation and Delegated Regulations made thereunder are directly applicable in Ireland, as they are in other Member States.</p>  <p>  The new rules are designed to give increased protection against the spread of disease through animal movement over and above the rules which were in place heretofore.</p>  <p>  Animals are required to complete a 30-day residency in a single establishment (herd) to be considered eligible to be exported either directly from that establishment of origin where they have established their 30 day residency or through a maximum of three assembly operations prior to departure to another country.</p>  <p>  There is a 14-day time limit from the date an animal departs its establishment of origin to its date of departure from the ultimate assembly centre in Ireland for another member state. Additionally each livestock animal subjected to assembly operations must be moved to their final place of destination in another Member State at the latest within 20 days after the date of leaving the establishment of origin. This allows a maximum six day period to complete its journey to destination in another member state. </p>  <p>  In the case of the transport of animals by sea, this period of 20 days may be extended by the duration of the journey by sea (Article 43 (1)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 688 of 2020.</p>  <p>  The Department has issued detailed guidance to industry by way of a Trader Notice on 4th March 2022 , 12th May 2022 and 16th May 2022 which outline the relevant requirements.  Introduction of this legislation is required to ensure that Ireland remains in compliance with its obligations as a Member State, However, noting recent challenges to live exports due to unavailability of ferry and lairage capacity, which were outside the control of the exporters, it has been decided to temporarily delay the introduction of the '14-day rule' pending a review of the associated operational procedures and further consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

Ireland will instead provide exchequer funding separate to Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/467 to other sectors in the context of the illegal invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the use of the EU exceptional aid provision, and in acknowledgement of the need to address the multiple impacts of the illegal invasion in Ukraine on food supply chains and food security, significant funding has already been allocated towards Exchequer funded measures including a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector, and the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme  .</p></reply>

It is a statutory levy on all thoroughbred foals registered in Ireland in the General Stud Book through Weatherbys Ireland. The scheme is administered by Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and provides a secure financial footing for the breeding industry and essential support structures </p><p>The levy was introduced specifically to address the need for predictable funding for essential infrastructure in the thoroughbred industry, namely the Irish Equine Centre (IEC), Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association (ITBA).  The levy is applicable on all thoroughbred foals registered in the Republic of Ireland whether or not a siring fee is paid.</p><p>HRI has informed my Department  that the levy relates to the nomination fee of the foal&rsquo;s sire and varies between &euro;35 and &euro;650. In 2021 38% of foals were charged a levy of &euro;100 or less, 51% of foals paid between &euro;150 to &euro;300 and 11% of foals paid between &euro;350 and &euro;650. HRI has advised that the levy has  a compliance rate of 98%.</p><p>HRI has advised that it has a dedicated Foal Levy Committee comprising three representatives from HRI, three from the ITBA and one member nominated by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA).

This was 20% higher than during the scheme opening last year. My priority is to continue to grow the organic sector and I have introduced a number of  specific new measures to encourage higher participation in Organic Farming </p>  <p>  For the period 2023 &ndash; 2027, I have proposed an allocation of &euro;256 million under the new CAP Strategic Plan to continue the development and growth of the organic sector. This is a five-fold increase in funding for the sector compared to the previous CAP period. </p>  <p>  I have also introduced changes to the Organic Farming Scheme requirements by reducing the required stocking rate and also by increasing the area paid at the higher rate from 60 hectares to 70 hectares, which I believe will allow for greater participation in organic farming practices.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all farmers across the country have access to quality advisory support as they consider converting to organic farming, I have recently provided funding to the Agricultural Consultants Association to increase Advisory support in the sector. This will help remove the knowledge gap which is one of the more significant impediments to participation in organic farming practices. </p>  <p>  Teagasc are also currently expanding their Advisory support capacity.  The expected results of this funding increase with regard to higher participation in Organic Farming will be visible when the scheme reopens later in 2022.  </p>  <p>  My colleague Minister of State Hackett is also leading a trade mission to Germany in July 2022 to coincide with Biofach, the largest organic trade fair in Europe. Routes to market for organic produce is a key consideration for farmers that are contemplating converting to organic farming and this trade mission is well resourced to ensure all market opportunities are maximised and visible to potential scheme participants. </p>  <p>  The Department is pursuing a wide suite of actions and has deployed significant targeted resources to maximise participation in Organic farming.  Our commitment to achieve the 7.5% Programme for Government target is gaining in momentum and is evidenced by the most recent figures which yielded a 20% increase in applicants compared to 2021. </p>  <p>  We continue to engage proactively with industry stakeholders and explore all opportunities to pursue a solutions based agenda.</p></reply>

In its organisation, there were a number of one-off costs in recent years, such as meeting and implementing the recommendations of the 2017 Indecon Report.

The role of the body as the regulator of horse racing was set out in legislation under the Irish Horse Racing Industry Act 1994 however the body itself remains a private entity.  The role of the IHRB is provided for under the Irish Horse Racing Act 2016 and subsequent Statutory Instruments.The IHRB has informed this Department that following the recommendation of an industry wide task force in 2016, an Equine Anti-Doping Department was set up by the then Turf Club that year. One of the first tasks for the new Department was to run a public procurement for the laboratory services for the regulator and LGC was the successful candidate with the contract coming into effect in 2018. Prior to this, the statistics published for samples taken from horses were compiled for the billing period of the laboratory. From 2018, new systems were adopted which allowed for in-house administration to track the figures in a more efficient basis and give the figures from a calendar year rather than a billing year. The discrepancies referred to in the material provided by the Deputy to my Department are due to an overlap in the billing period where samples taken in December would not be accounted for until the following year, whereas since LGC have become the contracted laboratory, the figures given were for the calendar year.</p></reply>

Information on GLAS was made widely available as was evidenced by the uptake of Scheme by over 50,000 participants. A series of information meetings were held at the launch of GLAS in 2015 and full details of the option to transfer to GLAS were made available to AEOS participants. Information on the option to move from AEOS to GLAS was also provided in the press, and by Department staff at various fora. </p>  <p>  You may wish to note that a new agri-environmental climate measure (AECM) is currently being developed by my Department.  It is one of a range of interventions proposed in Ireland's draft CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) 2023 &ndash; 2027, which is currently with the EU Commission for consideration and approval.  &euro;1.5 billion has been allocated to this flagship agri-environment scheme which will be the successor to GLAS.  While formal approval for the draft CSP is awaited and aspects of the draft Plan may be subject to change, please note that it is proposed, as was the case in GLAS, that all farmers, who apply for the Basic Payment Scheme, will have access to the new AECM. </p></reply>

Having regard to the importance attached in Food Vision 2030 to attracting and nurturing diverse and inclusive talent across the agri-food sector, my Department is working with Teagasc and other stakeholders to provide education and training opportunities for those interested in a career in agriculture. </p>  <p>  Teagasc currently offers 17 agricultural courses across 25 training locations comprising seven agricultural colleges and 17 regional education locations. All Teagasc courses and proposed apprenticeships are open to applications from both EU and non-EU students. Significant progress has been made over the last 18-months to develop land sector apprenticeships programmes in Sportsturf, Horticulture, Equine and Farm Management. It is intended that three of the new apprenticeships will be rolled out this year. Apprentices will be employed by approved employers and will compete the classroom element with Teagasc.  </p>  <p>  Teagasc is also committed to using its Walsh Scholarships Postgraduate Programme to support the training of international graduates to Masters and PhD level in the fields of agriculture, food, environmental science, agri-food economics, rural development, horticulture, and other related disciplines.

The number of forestry appeals received in 2020 also increased significantly from 489 appeals in 2019 to 874 appeals in 2020 and had a significant impact on available Appeals Officer resources and on the administrative section within the Appeals Office. </p><p>These increases and the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, resulted in a reduction in the number of agriculture appeals closed and an increase in the time to close appeals in 2020.</p><p>The Agriculture Appeals Office adapted to the situation by offering remote hearings or the option to have the case decided without an oral hearing.  However, many appellants requested that the appeal be delayed until such a time as an oral hearing could be held. Remote hearings were held where appellants requested one and non-oral hearing cases were prioritised during COVID-19 restricted periods.</p><p>There was a significant decrease in the number of forestry appeals submitted to the FAC in 2021 and this combined with the easing of COVID restrictions in June 2021, which allowed for a return to in-person oral hearings, reduced the delays in closing appeals in 2021.</p><p>The records of the Agriculture Appeals Office indicate the following for 2021: <table>    <tr>       <th>Appeals Received in 2021</th>       <th>809</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Appeals Received in 2021 awaiting a   decision</td>       <td>308</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average wait time from receipt of DAFM file to closure in 2021</td>       <td>124 Days</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As published in the 2020 Annual Report, the Agriculture Appeals Office has set itself a target of three months for closure of an appeal from the time of receipt of the Department file.</p><p>Due to circumstances outside of the control of the Agriculture Appeals Office, appeals might not be completed within that target time frame. In addition to the impact of COVID-19 and FAC commitments, the reasons for appeals being closed outside the three-month period varies and can include delays in agreeing dates for oral hearings with all parties, complexity of cases, legal issues, time taken by appellants and/or the Department to revert with additional information requested, and resource capacity. </p><p>I have been assured that the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently working on reducing the number of open appeals on hand and the time period from assignment to decision and has made significant progress in this regard in 2022 to date.</p></reply>

In that context, recent Teagasc survey data showed that  half of all drystock farmers had spread no chemical fertiliser on their silage ground whereas dairy famers had spread their chemical fertiliser. Therefore the risk of not saving sufficient fodder is more of a challenge for the  drystock farmers than it is for  dairy farmers. In addition, in light of current milk prices, the economic viability of Dairy farming in general, is stronger than  either  beef or sheep farming.</p></reply>

In recent years, Ash dieback disease has been found to be widespread in all 26 counties. Since the first finding of ash dieback disease in Ireland, the Department has provided support totalling over &euro;7 million to owners of ash plantations impacted by ash dieback disease through the ash dieback reconstitution scheme (introduced in 2013) and more recently the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS &ndash; Ash dieback) introduced in July 2020.  We have committed under the Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 to refocus on the delivery of most approvals under the  Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme. The plantation size appears to be quite small in the details you provided.  However to be considered for conversion to another land use a felling licence application would need to be submitted along with a case for conversion of this small area of ash to biodiversity.  When received, my officials can then examine the context of the application and engage with the applicant.  Please note also that deforestation is subject to planning permission from the Local Authority.</p></reply>

Three separate reports will examine </p><p>- The training needs of Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs);</p><p>- An assessment of the skills gaps of voluntary boards of mid-sized organisations;</p><p>- An assessment of skills gaps across smaller community &amp;amp; voluntary groups.</p><p>The findings and recommendations arising from these research reports will inform decisions in my Department and across Government on how best to support the training and development needs of the sector. </p><p>In the meantime, training for the sector is being addressed in a number of other ways across my Department and across Government, including significant funding from the National Training Fund, administered by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. </p><p>The number of persons employed in the community, rural development projects and charity sector is not readily quantifiable. However, the strategy itself, using data from the Charities Regulator&rsquo;s <i>Registered Irish Charities Social and Economic Impact Report</i><i>2018</i>, confirms that charities support some 290,000 employees. Using this figure as a guide, a training fund of &euro;100 per employee would cost in the region of &euro;29,000,000. It should be noted however, that not all organisations working in the sector operate as charities registered with the Charities Regulator, therefore the figure provided is a conservative estimate.</p></reply>

The Agricultural Shows support programme is funded under Project Ireland 2040 as part of &ldquo;Our Rural Future&quot;</p><p>I recently announced an increase in funding to &euro;700,000 for 2022 to support the return of the agricultural shows after a two year hiatus due to the pandemic. Some 120 events are set to benefit and I hope that this funding will help put the shows on a firmer financial footing and provide vital support to the committees responsible for organising the events throughout the country.</p><p>I am delighted to be able to acknowledge the hard work, commitment and dedication that goes into every show and I am pleased that the Irish Shows Association (ISA) is once again working with my Department to administer the funding.  </p><p>Based on returns from the ISA, the table below sets out the amount drawn down in respect of each show over the period 2018 to 2021. As the allocations are based on vouched expenditure, individual allocations per show are not available yet for the &euro;700,000 support provided in 2022. On average each show will attract funding in the region of &euro;5,000-&euro;6,000.  In 2020/2021 shows were not run due to ongoing public health restrictions, but reduced funding was put in place in light of ongoing costs which arose at that time.</p><p>A full directory of the Shows is published on the ISA website.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Agricultural Show</th>       <th>County</th>

This pilot solution was developed in consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe and is being implemented on a two year trial basis. </p>  <p>  This pilot policy as well as the proposed amendments to the Occupiers' Liability Act represents a substantial step forward on this matter. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Galway County Council is responsible for the development of stage 3 of this project. </p>  <p>  As part of the preparatory works, the National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI) was instructed by Galway County Council to develop a model simulation for the harbour.

It is hoped that the simulation will be completed, and tested with feedback given, by the end of August. </p>  <p>  To feed into this process, additional bathymetric studies are also to be carried out in the harbour to gather further data. This will be a multi-beam mapping survey, which will be highly detailed, but requires suitable conditions to be carried out. Galway County Council advised my Department at a meeting between officials last week that, due to unsettled weather and marine conditions, the bathymetric survey has not yet been completed.

However, the relevant legislation in this area, the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 2014, sets out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog. The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs, including strains or crosses of those breeds,  have to follow.  Such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age, when in a public place.</p>  <p>  Concerns had been raised regarding the overall approach to the regulation of restricted breeds.  Some stakeholders asserted that more breeds should be added to the list &ndash; especially given the newer breeds that have arrived in Ireland over the last number of years. Others believed that a different approach should be taken which would focus on the behavioural issues of individual dogs, rather than specific breeds and should move away from muzzling.</p>  <p>  Following a review of this policy area, including a public consultation process to which over 1,000 responses were received, my Department recently published on gov.ie the report on &lsquo;A Review of Measures relating to the Control of Dogs in Ireland&rsquo;. A selection of the submissions received were also published alongside the report.  </p>  <p>  My Department is now identifying any necessary legislative amendments that may be required with a view to inclusion in the Government legislation programme.</p></reply>

Roscommon County Council subsequently approached my Department in March 2021 with a proposal to install the My Open Library service in Ballaghaderreen Library while it was closed to the public, pending the improvement works. My Department recognised this as being a very practical and cost-efficient approach and l was delighted to approve funding of &euro;95,250 in July 2021 for the installation of the My Open Library service in Ballaghaderreen. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Rosccommon County Council that they have conducted a technical assessment of the works that are to be carried out in Ballaghaderreen Library. The local authority has been advised by their engineer that, as the majority of the works are of a mechanical and electrical nature, it would be more efficient and practical for a mechanical and electrical consultant to be appointed to the project. Once appointed, this consultant will then lead a multidisciplinary team to include a conservation expert, and will prepare a scope of works for the project. This will be used to  progress the appointment of a contractor to carry out the works. Roscommon County Council have advised that they published a tender on 13 June 2022 seeking the services of a mechanical and electrical consultant and that the closing date for receipt of submissions is 27 June 2022.  </p>  <p>  Roscommon County Council acknowledges that Ballaghaderreen Library provides a vital service to the community, but the local authority is obliged to follow procurement guidelines and planning regulations. While the local authority advised that works will commence in Q4 2022, they are fully dedicated to the project and will initiate works sooner if at all possible. </p>  <p>  Roscommon County Council expect the library to re-open in Q2 2023.

The plans also included a number of changes to the library layout along with the installation of new shelving and furniture to create more usable spaces in the main library and allow for significant expansion of the children&rsquo;s library space. </p><p>Works in Strokestown Library commenced on 27th November 2020 but were delayed due to three issues that were beyond the control of Roscommon County Council. </p><p>Firstly, on 8 January 2021 there was a nationwide shutdown of construction activity as part of the national effort to halt the spread of COVID-19, and this resulted in all works on Strokestown Library being paused. Government restrictions were lifted on 4 May 2021 and works resumed immediately with final snagging on the project being completed in September 2021.  </p><p>Furniture and shelving were delivered to the library in November 2021 but some items of furniture were damaged in transit and required a replacement order. This resulted in final items only being received in February 2022. </p><p>Finally, the implementation of a new national library management system during March and April this year caused delays to the processing of the new lending collection for the library. All stock was processed through the new computer system during May and early June and Roscommon County Council have advised me that Strokestown Library reopened to the public on 10th June, followed by an official reopening event on 14 June. In addition to the works carried  out,  Strokestown Library has also increased its opening hours from 23 hours per week to 28.5 hours per week which will be a very welcome increase in service for patrons.  </p><p>The funding of &euro;40,000 that was allocated to Roscommon County Council for the refurbishment of Strokestown Library has been fully drawn down.</p></reply>

The National Treasury Management Agency sets aside part of this to maintain a reserve account for future repayments to account holders or their rightful heirs. This reserve fund currently stands at &euro;108.4 million, leaving a total of &euro;171.8 million available for future disbursements through the Dormant Accounts Annual Action Plan process. There are approvals of &euro;63 million currently in place through Annual Action Plans, including the 2022 Action Plan, and this funding will be drawn down from the &euro;171.8 million available. The 2022 Dormant Accounts Action Plan approved measures worth &euro;55.5 million, and based on the level of funding available within the Fund, a similar amount is expected to be approved for the 2023 Dormant Accounts Action Plan. Future disbursement levels depend on the inflows into the fund, which are difficult to predict. However, given very strong recent expenditure, it is expected that over time disbursement levels will need to gradually reduce to around &euro;40 million per annum, which is a current average rate of net inflows into the fund.  This will ensure a continued long term positive impact in terms of addressing disadvantage through the fund. It must also be noted that the use of Dormant Accounts Funds is subject to the constraints of any other voted expenditure and adds overall Government debt, meaning the future use of funds is also subject to these constraints. </p></reply>

The local authority has been advised by their engineer that as the majority of the works are of a mechanical and electrical nature, it would be more efficient and practical for a mechanical and electrical consultant to be appointed to the project. Once appointed, this consultant will lead a multidisciplinary team to include a conservation expert, and will then prepare a scope of works for the project. This will be used to progress the appointment of a contractor to carry out the works. Roscommon County Council have advised my Department that  they have published a tender on 13 June 2022 seeking the services of a mechanical and electrical consultant with a closing date for receipt of submissions of 27 June 2022. The conservation expert will be in place from the outset to the completion of the project.  </p>  <p>  Roscommon County Council acknowledges that Ballaghaderreen Library provides a vital service to the community, but the local authority is obliged to follow procurement guidelines and planning regulations. Accordingly, it is not possible for works to be brought forward or fast-tracked. However, while the local authority has advised that works will commence in Q4 2022, they are fully dedicated to the project and will initiate works sooner if at all possible.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, Roscommon County Council has advised that the mobile library continues to provide a service in the town every Thursday and the local authority will continue to monitor demand throughout the duration of the works.</p></reply>
