A free trade agreement is likely to take some considerable time to deliver, so we also asked officials to ensure progress on market access issues that currently act as a barrier to smooth trade between us.</p><p>I regularly interact with the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen on a range of issues, including matters relating to Covid-19 and economic recovery. We are very much of like-mind on the need to work with pharma companies to increase the supply of vaccines at global level as rapidly as we can, and to support the work of COVAX in making vaccines available throughout the world. I also regularly brief her on the situation in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year President von der Leyen and I have participated in videoconferences of EU leaders convened by the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, on 21 January, 25-26 February and 25 March 2021.</p></reply>

The approach of the Shared Island initiative is founded on the Good Friday Agreement and engaging with all communities and traditions to build consensus around a shared future on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Shared Island unit in my Department is a driver and coordinator for this work. Operationally, the unit is focusing its work in three areas: commissioning research, fostering dialogue, and building a Shared Island agenda, including delivery of the commitments in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government announced the Shared Island Fund  , &euro;500m to be made available out to 2025, ring-fenced for Shared Island projects. </p>  <p>  The Shared Island Fund provides significant new, multi-annual capital funding for investment on a strategic basis in collaborative North/South projects that will support the commitments and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The funding will support the delivery of key cross-border infrastructure initiatives set out in the Programme for Government and foster new investment and development opportunities on a North/South basis. In December, the Government approved over &euro;6m in funding from the Shared Island Fund to enable the continued restoration of the Ulster Canal and further development of the Ulster Canal Greenway. </p>  <p>  On 28 April, Minister Humphreys and I launched Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration project - between Clones and Clonfad - with almost &euro;5.6m in funding from the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, in addition to &euro;6m committed by the Shared Island Fund. The Shared Island Fund has also provided a further &euro;1 million for Phase 3 of the project &ndash; Clonfad to Castle Saunderson &ndash; to undertake the feasibility and pre-construction work, which has now begun.</p>  <p>  The Ulster Canal is an excellent example of what North/South cooperation can achieve, as an amenity that connects towns and communities in the central border region, and a sustainable tourism initiative that will create jobs and be a lynchpin for other economic opportunity, on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council, including to progress key cross-border investment projects, which are part of our Shared Island commitments in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>I launched the Shared Island Dialogue Series   to support constructive and inclusive civic engagement on all aspects of a shared future on the island. The series is seeking as broad a range of perspective and experience as possible and supports the Government&rsquo;s commitment to engage with all communities and traditions on the island on a shared future.</p>  <p>  I addressed a Dialogue with young people on 26 November, on the theme of &ldquo;New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement&rdquo;. Dialogues on Climate and Environment; Civil Society engagement; and Equality on the island, have also been held in recent months, with participation by the relevant Government Ministers. </p>  <p>  The Dialogue series will continue through this year, including with a focus on Economy, Health and Education on the island. </p>  <p>The Shared Island unit is progressing a comprehensive research programme  , working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council and other partners. North/South and East-West collaboration will be an important part of this work. Initial scoping papers on the ESRI research will be published this month.</p>  <p>  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South are key objectives of this work.</p>  <p>  The research programme with the ESRI is on &lsquo;The Economic and Social Opportunities from Increased Cooperation on the Shared Island&rsquo;. Research outputs will be published and 2021 work is examining aspects of health, education, enterprise and the services economy on the island. Scoping papers on each of the ESRI research topics were published on Monday, 17 May.</p>  <p>  The National Economic and Social Council are preparing a report to Government on Shared Island this year, informed by broad consultation, which NESC is conducting with stakeholders North and South. </p>  <p>  The Shared Island unit is also working with the Irish Research Council and a funding call is open at present for academic contributions to the Shared Island research programme across a wide range of themes.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Government is committed to working to enhance all aspects of North-South cooperation on the island, including in third-level education, and to supporting a North/South programme of research and innovation, including an all-island research hub.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800072#WRB00500"><p>The Department provides two main payment method options for people in receipt of social welfare.  They can be paid in cash at the post office or they can have their payment made directly into their account in either a bank, in An Post or in a credit union.  The Department intends, where possible, to continue to offer people the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution</p>  <p>  With the co-operation of An Post, a number of measures were introduced  to support those collecting their social welfare payments at post offices over the last year.  These changes helped reduce the movement of people, including medically vulnerable individuals, and assisted them in complying with social distancing measures designed to combat the spread of Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  One of the Covid-19 measures introduced was to give all welfare claimants &ndash; including jobseekers - the option to switch their payment method from the post office to payment into their bank account by electronic fund transfer (or EFT).  Claimants had to apply to Departmental offices to request this change.  </p>  <p>  Before the pandemic, the default payment option for those in receipt of a jobseeker payment was collection at a post office.  Payment by this method offers the Department additional control checks which can assist in the prevention of Social Welfare fraud.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to offer choice of payment method to its customers.  However, no decision has yet been taken on whether to permanently adopt the EFT payment option for those receiving jobseeker payments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800072#WRB00800"><p>Short-Time Work Support is a social insurance contribution payment provided under Jobseekers Benefit for employees temporarily placed on a shorter working week by their employer and who are not being paid for days of unemployment. </p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit support is paid for up to 9 months (or 234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid.  It is paid for up to 6 months (or 156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  It is a fundamental feature of a range of PRSI related benefits that they are time limited including Maternity Benefit and Illness Benefit.</p>  <p>  Where a person exhausts their entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit, they may be eligible for support under the means tested Jobseeker's Allowance scheme.  In these cases, the Department will contact the recipient in advance to advise them of the expiry of their claim and the availability of Jobseekers Allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a range of supports that allow people to combine work with welfare including the availability of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme for employers to support job retention.  The wide ranging nature of the assistance available constitutes a comprehensive suite of supports.  On that basis I believe there are sufficient supports available at this time.</p>  <p>  Rent supplement continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme currently supporting 19,570 recipients.</p>  <p>  The scheme ensures that eligible persons who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.  Since the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s Covid emergency response in March 2020 there have been over 12,500 applications approved, of which 8,640 remain in payment.</p>  <p>  The overarching Covid-19 response in the case of Rent Supplement is to provide a flexible case-by-case driven solution for customers and my Department will continue to operate on this basis for those returning to full-time work on a phased basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800072#WRB01100"><p>To begin with, it is important to note that self-employment is a perfectly legitimate and vital feature of the Irish economy with over 330,000 people employed this way.  It is also the case that there is no compelling evidence that false self-employment is widespread, as some might suggest.</p><p>That said, false self-employment does exist and, as such, is a matter that I and the Department take very seriously.  I do not want to see  a situation where any workers are denied their social insurance entitlements or where much-needed funds are denied to the depleted Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>The deliberate misclassification of a worker as a self-employed contractor for PRSI purposes is wrong. The Social Welfare Consolidation Act contains specific offences in relation to the return of employment contributions which, on conviction, can result in fines and/or imprisonment.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there is no &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; solution that would completely eradicate false self-employment.  The best way to tackle it is through inspection, compliance and deterrence.  The Department has significantly increased its employer inspections in recent years through its network of 380 Social Welfare Inspectors nationwide.  It also established the Employment Status Inspection Unit (ESIU) in mid-2019, comprising six Inspectors focused solely on detecting false self-employment.</p><p>This Unit has already carried out hundreds of employment status investigations in a wide range of sectors, including construction, meat processing, fitness, language training and media sectors.  As the economy opens up, control activities in the construction sector, as well as hairdressing and personal services, are being increased. </p><p>False self-employment does not always involve a deliberate or fraudulent misclassification of an employee.  Sometimes it happens that both employer and employee are genuinely mistaken in their approach and are happy to correct the position once the Department&rsquo;s officials make a determination. </p><p>Therefore, I believe it is vital that employers and workers have clear information and guidance when looking at employment status.  That is why I put great value on the <i>Code of Practice on Determining Employment</i>S<i>tatus</i>.  We have recently updated the Code to reflect the modern world of work, and to reflect the legislation and case law that has emerged from various court cases over the years.  </p><p>I intend to publish the revised Code shortly and would encourage all affected stakeholders to make sure they are familiar with its content.</p></reply>

These contracts have been in place in many cases for over 20 years with no formal procurement being undertaken in that period.  This is not in compliance with the requirements of good governance or proper procurement.  My Department intends to go out to procure sufficient high-quality employment services in a manner that is compatible with EU and national procurement rules.   </p>  <p>  This is in line with detailed legal advice obtained by my Department that these employment services must be procured though open competitive procurement processes in line with EU and national procurement rules.  This advice is unequivocal and ignoring it would likely expose my Department to legal challenge. </p>  <p>  I have instructed my officials to ensure that while complying with procurement law no barriers are placed in the way of local development companies or other non-profit entities on submitting viable tenders for employment services.  The requests for tenders will include a strong focus on quality of services directed at clients, particularly the long-term unemployed.  There will be ample opportunity for tenderers to demonstrate the quality services they can provide to those furthest from the labour market.  In particular, while cost will be a factor to be considered, the primary evaluation criteria relate to service quality including community engagement.  The RFT is designed to ensure that a bidder cannot secure an advantage by submitting unrealistically low pricing.  It is expected that the tender will prove attractive to local community-based organisations, including the Local Development Companies.  </p>  <p>  Organisations with strong experience in the delivery of similar services at a community and local level will be in a strong position to respond to the RFTs when they issue.</p></reply>

In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government, the research will provide a valuable input to inform policy on the provision of supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities.  The report is expected in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  This matter is considerably wider than the income support system and will not be addressed through income support alone which is why a whole-of-Government perspective is being taken.</p>  <p>  As part of the research a survey of over 34,000 people with disabilities was undertaken.  The very large sample was designed to give individuals living with a disability an opportunity to contribute directly to the research.  The high number of responses, 4,700, makes this one of the largest surveys of its kind of individuals with disabilities undertaken in Ireland.  I look forward to receiving the completed report shortly.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I introduced a number of measures to support people with disabilities, this included an increase of &euro;20 in the earnings disregard for recipients of Disability Allowance.  This will affect 15,000 recipients and cost &euro;2.9m in 2021.  Other measures include a &euro;1,000 Training Grant to help people with disabilities who are seeking employment, and an increase of &euro;150 to the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  The new Grant rate of &euro;1,850 is the highest rate ever and will be paid in June. </p>  <p>  Finally, it would be premature at this point to give any commitments regarding the allocation of public expenditure towards existing or additional payments while awaiting the outcomes of the research.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to provide a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</p><p>The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible, and so it is focussed on long term payments where an applicant satisfies a means test. </p><p>As this House knows, the Government has put unprecedented resources into a range of supports for workers and families during these extraordinary times.</p><p>As part of that, and based on ESRI research, the Government targeted budget increases at the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance to boost the incomes of the poorest in our society.  This resulted in the Fuel Allowance being increased from the start of this year by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28, thus ensuring that recipients benefitted during the coldest part of the year. </p><p>The supports in place are kept under constant review and amended in keeping with changing circumstances.  In that context it is worth noting that at this time we have the vaccination program in progress,  restrictions are being eased, many people are returning to work, and people are able to meet outside again. </p><p>Finally, my Department does provide support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme to people who may be having difficult with their utility bills.  </p><p>Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

All of these schemes are available to eligible people who are in need of income support. </p><p>The Covid-19 Enterprise Support Grant and the Covid-19 Part-time Job Incentive Scheme are available to self-employed workers to support them in re-opening their businesses. </p><p>In addition, funding for the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and its successor, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), is provided through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The administration of these schemes is undertaken by Revenue to provide support which is directed through employers.  These employers may be sole traders or corporate entities.</p><p>The total cost from March 2020 to the end of April 2021 on all these schemes, including the provision of funding to Revenue for the TWSS and the EWSS, is &euro;13.15 billion.</p><p>The breakdown of expenditure is as follows:</p><p>The spend on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) since March 2020 to April 2021 is &euro;7.32 billion.  Nearly &euro;5 billion was paid in 2020 with &euro;2.34 billion paid from January to end of April 2021. (Expenditure to date is now estimated to be of the order of &euro;7.5 billion.)</p><p>The spend on the Enhanced Covid-19 Illness Benefit is &euro;99 million, of which &euro;57 million was paid in 2020 and &euro;42 million in 2021 to date.</p><p>The spend on the Covid-19 Enterprise Support Grant is &euro;8 million. &euro;7 million was paid in 2020 and &euro;1 million in 2021.  </p><p>Expenditure on Covid-19 Rent Supplement is &euro;60 million, of which &euro;38 million was paid in 2020 and &euro;22 million paid up to April 2021.</p><p>The spend on Covid-19 Part time Job Incentive for the Self-Employed is &euro;0.4 million, most of which was incurred in 2021.  This was effectively a new scheme introduced towards the end of 2020.</p><p>In terms of the schemes administered by Revenue, total TWSS expenditure was &euro;2.7 billion.  This scheme operated from March to September 2020.  The spend on EWSS since September 2020 is &euro;2.9 billion, of which &euro;1.4 billion was paid in 2020 and &euro;1.5 billion paid in 2021.</p><p>The very significant level of expenditure on these schemes has been crucial in helping to ease the financial impact of the pandemic on hundreds of thousands of workers and their employers.</p></reply>

The specific lots will be detailed in the request for tender, when it is published. </p><p>  The current annual &quot;cost met&quot; funding approach, used with current LES and Job Club contracts, requires a level of scrutiny of day-to-day expenditure, which places an undue administrative burden on both the employment service provider and my Department.  Such an approach diverts valuable resources away from supporting clients, doing little to enhance employment outcomes for the long-term unemployed.  Moving to a new multiannual funding approach, which pays for each client referred, coupled with a strong emphasis on quality of service provision, will reduce the administrative burden and is more likely to deliver enhanced outcomes for those availing of the service.  </p><p>  The forthcoming procurement will focus primarily on the quality of services to be provided and will have no impact on the contracts of existing providers in other areas. </p><p>Separately, the current contracts for all contracted employment services, including Job Clubs, expire at the end of 2021.

It provides valuable services to local communities while supporting long term unemployed in acquiring new skills and work experience.</p><p>The focus of CE is on long-term unemployed people, that is people who have been unemployed for more than twelve months.</p><p>A key qualifying condition for the majority of CE candidates is that a person must first be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum of 12 months. </p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is an income support introduced as a temporary measure to address the emergency needs of people who lost employment as a direct consequence of Covid-19.  It is not a qualifying payment for CE.  However, time spent in receipt of PUP counts towards the duration of unemployment required to be eligible for CE. </p><p>In other words, a person in receipt of PUP will need to first qualify for a qualifying payment &ndash; e.g. Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance &ndash; before they can be considered eligible for CE.  At that point, any days spent in receipt of PUP will be treated as days of unemployment for the purposes of determining eligibility for CE.</p><p>Many persons currently in receipt of PUP will return to their previous employment as COVID-19 restrictions ease.  Unfortunately, however, others will not.  I am aware of the significant number of persons who have been on PUP since March and April 2020, who could benefit by the opportunities provided by CE placements if their previous jobs do not return over the next few months.  Government are very conscious of the need to provide additional activation and other employment supports to assist this category of persons back to work.  </p><p>Under the July Jobs Stimulus, funding is provided for an additional 3,000 places for state employment programmes including CE and T&uacute;s.  These additional places will provide additional supports for those who have been unemployed for over a year, including time spent on PUP.  Once their eligibility for CE is confirmed, unemployed persons can apply for the range of existing CE vacancies accessible within their community which will give them an opportunity to avail of the valuable training and work experience available on these CE placements. </p><p>I will continue to support and improve the CE programme for the benefit of long-term unemployed participants, including those whose employment have been adversely affected by the pandemic as the restrictions begin to ease and the economy recovers.</p></reply>

The contract agreement between the Department and the CE sponsoring authorities establishes their role as an independent contractor.  CE sponsoring authorities are the legal employers of CE supervisors, CE assistant supervisors and CE participants.</p><p>The CE sponsoring authorities receive state funding to cover the salary costs of supervisors, assistant supervisors and participant remuneration, training and material costs from the Department.  CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors are not public servants or employees of the Department or the state. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors have been seeking for several years, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for CE supervisors who are employed by CE schemes.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue relating solely to CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.  Any proposal to resolve this specific issue, can and will only apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors. </p><p>Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this issue over the past number of months, while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Officials from my Department also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p><p>I am pleased to report that agreement was reached recently between my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue.  Details of these proposals have been forwarded to the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors by my Department officials.  I understand the unions are currently considering these proposals and have sought clarification on a number of the details contained therein.  My Department are engaging with both unions on this basis.</p><p>I am confident this is a solid basis for progressing and resolving this complex issue, while ensuring there is no potential exposure for additional costs to the exchequer. </p><p>Minister Humphreys and I will continue to support CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities.</p></reply>

CE also provides valuable training opportunities for participants.</p><p>The 2021 Budget for CE is &euro;362.7 million which provides for approximately 22,668 CE placements.  The Budget for T&uacute;s is &euro;98.77 million which provides for approximately 5,825 T&uacute;s placements.</p><p>At the end of April 2021 there were 19,371 participants on CE and 4,044 participants on T&uacute;s.  The number of referrals to CE and Tus has been impacted by public health restrictions in place over the past year.  It is anticipated that referrals will now begin to increase as the economy re-opens with the vaccine rollout.</p><p>In addition, as part of the July Stimulus Package 2020, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on state employment programmes.  The additional places will be distributed between CE and T&uacute;s.  These additional places will provide additional valuable opportunities for long-term unemployed persons, including eligible long term unemployed persons whose employment is affected by the pandemic.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.78.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800072#WRB06000"><p>The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive Policy Review of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, including an examination of the means test, was prepared by my Department and was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the end of August 2019.  In addition, in August 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a Spending Review of Carer&rsquo;s Supports, including Carer's Allowance.  Among its key findings was that of the &euro;1.04bn spent on Carer&rsquo;s Support Programmes in 2018, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance accounted for 77% of total support spend on carers.  Given how little time has elapsed since these two in-depth reports on carer&rsquo;s schemes were published, I do not propose to conduct another report on the area at this time. </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week.  As per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021.  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  Those existing carers whose sole income is the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would not benefit.  An increase in the means disregard would benefit just 3% of carers and benefit better-off families.  Increases to the disregard would result in the provision of additional payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to provide income supports to lower income households. </p>  <p>  Carer's Benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for someone in need of full-time care and attention.  A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for.  It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks.  </p>  <p>  From an evidence based perspective it should be noted that not all those claiming Carer&rsquo;s Benefit opt to remain in payment for the full 104 weeks.  My Department has examined this matter and found that the average duration on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit was 76.5 weeks between 2018 and 2020.  Therefore, the current 104-week payment duration represents a reasonable length of time to support a carer&rsquo;s temporary absence from work.  Where care is provided beyond the period of entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, the means tested Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is available for those who are in need of income support.  These arrangements ensure an efficient use of public funds while assisting those who are in most need of an income support. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the right to carer's leave from employment complements the Carer's Benefit Scheme.  The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention.  A person is entitled to take carer&rsquo;s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.  Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act ensures that people who want to take carer's leave will have their jobs kept open for them while they are on carer's leave. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in an overall budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months.  A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).</p>  <p>  Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p>  <p>  Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p>  <p>  Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.</p>  <p>  With regard to apprenticeships, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched last month by my colleague, Minister Harris.  The Action Plan sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.  The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.</p>  <p>  My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age.  This programme will seek to encourage businesses provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.  I expect to launch the Programme in the near future. </p>  <p>  These initiatives will be further strengthened by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department.  Pathways to Work is the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy.  It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market.  This whole-of-Government strategy will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  Publication is expected in the coming months, following the launch of the Government's Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Moving to a new multiannual funding approach, which pays for each client referred to the service, coupled with a strong emphasis on quality of service provision will reduce the administrative burden and is more likely to deliver enhanced outcomes for those availing of the service. </p>  <p>  Separately, the current contracts for all contracted Public Employment Service (PES) provision, expire at the end of 2021.  These contracts have been in place in many cases for over 20 years with no formal procurement being undertaken in that period.  This is not in compliance with the requirements of good governance or proper procurement.  My Department is therefore developing a series of RFTs to ensure that with effect from 2022 the Public Employment Service has sufficient capacity and can deliver a sufficient high-quality employment service in order to support all those who need our assistance and help in securing employment.   </p>  <p>  Organisations, including the Local Development Companies, with strong experience in the delivery of similar services at a community and local level, will be in a strong position to respond to the RFTs when they issue.</p></reply>

Indecon&rsquo;s work programme to date has included the following elements:</p>  <p>  A review of existing international research, including approaches to defining &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo; and government responses to costs of disability. </p>  <p>  Analysis of detailed datafiles of the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) and the Household Budget Survey (HBS).</p>  <p>  An extensive stakeholder engagement with disability representative organisations, including invitation to make submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition, a comprehensive survey of people with disabilities was undertaken.  The survey was sent in paper format to a random sample of over 34,000 individuals in receipt of disability related payments.  The very large sample is designed to ensure that the different costs incurred by individuals with a disability are taken into account.  This survey was designed in consultation with a wide range of disability representative bodies and aimed to provide individuals living with a disability an opportunity to contribute directly to the research.  An accessible survey was specifically designed, in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind Ireland, for those in receipt of the Blind Pension.  The survey was also available online. </p>  <p>  The high number of responses, approximately 4,700, makes this, to Indecon&rsquo;s knowledge, the largest survey of its kind of individuals with disabilities undertaken in Ireland. </p>  <p>  This is an important piece of work and it would be premature at this point to give any commitments regarding the allocation of public expenditure towards existing or additional payments while awaiting the outcomes of the research.  I look forward to receiving the completed report shortly.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The complainant declined the offer of an amicable resolution, including an apology, and so the DPC issued a formal decision in 2020.  <table>    <tr>       <th>YEAR</th>       <th>Department of the Taoiseach No. of Personal Data Breaches</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 &ndash; to date</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Public Health advice recommends the wearing of face coverings as a measure to assist in stopping the spread of COVID-19. The Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has published guidance around the use of face coverings and masks by the general public, as well as on the efficacy of visors compared with face masks, in the prevention of transmission of COVID-19. This guidance is available on the HPSC website.</p><p>Managing the risk of spread of COVID-19 in the workplace is important in relation to the health of workers. The Work Safely Protocol incorporates current advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) about measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community and in workplaces </p><p>In relation to the protection of workers who interact with customers and clients, the Work Safely Protocol sets out specific measures that an employer should take in relation to workers who have customer facing roles. These measures include;</p><p>-  eliminate physical interaction between workers and customers as much as is reasonably practicable through revised working arrangements, for example through provision of online or phone orders, contactless delivery or managed entry;</p><p>-  provide hand sanitisers at entry/exit points;</p><p>-  install physical barriers and clear markings to ensure that contact between workers and customers is kept to a minimum and to ensure that queues do not form between customers as they wait to be served;</p><p>-  implement a cleaning regime to ensure that contact points for workers and customers are kept visibly cleaned at all times;</p><p>-  display the advice on the COVID-19 measures in visible locations to ensure that customers are also adhering to what is required;</p><p>-  implement and adopt public health regulations in relation to use of face coverings in shops, shopping centres and other indoor settings;</p><p>-  provide masks to workers who need to interact with customers/others where a physical distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained;</p><p>The key to a safe workplace remains strong communication and a shared collaborative approach between employers and workers.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority is the lead agency with responsibility for checking compliance with the Protocol. Any worker, or employer, with a concern or a query about compliance with the Protocol should contact the Health and Safety Authority, through their Workplace Contact Unit at 1890 289 389 or at wcu@hsa.ie, for appropriate advice.</p></reply>

As we start to reopen the economy, the Government has agreed to the extension of the CRSS until 30<sup>th</sup>of June 2021.

It is a difficult time for Business owners, employees and their families. With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p><p>I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest that small business owners contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I am particularly mindful of the small and micro enterprise sectors whose contribution to our economy cannot be understated. They represent the majority of companies in Ireland and employ in the region of 788,000 workers. On the 11th May last, I announced that I had secured Government approval for the priority drafting of the Companies (Small Company Administrative Rescue Process and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021. The Bill amends the Companies Act 2014 to provide for a new dedicated rescue process for small and micro companies. </p><p>While Ireland&rsquo;s current rescue framework, examinership, is internationally recognised and successful in its own right, the associated costs mean it may be beyond the reach of small and micro companies. The Bill will ensure these companies have access to an alternative framework, which incorporates key elements of the existing examinership model in an administrative context.  The Bill provides an alternative to examinership, for the benefit of small and micro companies, which is more cost efficient and capable of conclusion within a shorter period of time. </p><p>The main provisions of the Bill can be broadly summarised as follows:</p><p>-  designed for &ldquo;small&rdquo; and micro companies (as defined by the Companies Act 2014) which represent 98% of companies in Ireland;</p><p>-  commenced by resolution of directors rather than by application to Court;</p><p>-  concluded within a shorter period than examinership;</p><p>-  overseen and assisted by insolvency practitioners &ndash; a &lsquo;Process Advisor&rsquo;;</p><p>-  the rescue plan can be passed by a simple majority in value of creditors;</p><p>-  provides for format of cross class cram down of debts designed to reduce costs;</p><p>-  does not require application to Court for approval of rescue plan (provided no creditor objections); and</p><p>-  gives safeguards against irresponsible and dishonest director behaviour.</p><p>Small and micro companies will be key to our country&rsquo;s economic recovery. It is for this reason that I am so committed to providing a genuine alternative for these companies. As we reopen the economy, I want these businesses to know that Government values their contribution and is committed to supporting their long-term viability.</p></reply>

However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. With this in mind, on 1st October 2020, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.</p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, a range of supports have been developed for businesses, including the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), wage subsidies, a commercial rates holiday, low-cost loans, and a VAT reduction. I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined if they have not already done so. I would also suggest that small business owners contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business. Details of the Code of Conduct and the wide range of supports available for business are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government identified a number of groups to support the formulation of policy responses at the different stages of the COVID-19 recovery. This included an SME and State Bodies Group. The objective of convening the SME and State Bodies Group is to provide a platform for dialogue on the current and potential future COVID-19 related challenges facing our SMEs, which will inform Government&rsquo;s ongoing response to COVID-19 for SMEs. I jointly chair this Group with the Minister for Finance. The Group consists of representation from a range of invited business representative bodies (for example, IBEC, ISME, SFA, and Chambers Ireland), the Central Bank, Government Departments and Government Agencies.</p>  <p>  Minister English also regularly meets with Retail Forum members and representatives from the retail, grocery, and distribution sector to discuss key concerns for the retail sector, which at times has included issues around commercial rents.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can help businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. </p></reply>

The measures include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), now extended until the 30th of June, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  I would suggest that the business involved should first check with their insurance company to see if they are covered for this eventuality. They may also wish to seek financial assistance through our various loans schemes, including the Microfinance Ireland (MFI) loan scheme. MFI works with small businesses with fewer than 10 employees and turnover up to &euro;2m, by providing unsecured business loans of &euro;2,000 to &euro;25,000 for commercially viable proposals. MFI loan applications can be made through your Local Enterprise Office and a discount of 1% can be availed of off the standard interest rate.</p>  <p>  The remit of my colleague Eamon Ryan TD., Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, includes supporting small Irish businesses trading online by enhancing citizen engagement with digital technology, and the government works to reduce the risks to internet infrastructure and services to maintain a resilient, secure and trustworthy online environment that people and businesses can rely upon for social and economic interaction.</p></reply>

The Goals are mainstreamed in domestic policy and the governance structure reflects a whole-of-government approach and ensures coordination and coherence, in particular where goals cover areas of shared responsibility. </p>  <p>  19 Actions were included in the first National Implementation Plan. Action 4 of the plan set out a commitment to include reference in all new Statements of Strategy to all SDG targets for which a Department has lead responsibility. </p>  <p>  The development of the next SDG Implementation Plan has commenced, with the intention of publication later this year. A National Progress report will be incorporated into the Plan and will assess the progress on the 19 Actions, including the commitment set out under Action 4. </p>  <p>  My Department published it Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 in February of this year. The strategy was developed in the context of my Department&rsquo;s role in contributing to the SDGs. Goal 5 of the Statement of Strategy commits the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to advancing the green transition in enterprise and to honouring its Climate Action commitments. The six SDG targets for which my Department had responsibility for at the time of the Statement&rsquo;s publication are specifically referenced in setting out how the Department will achieve this goal. The role of the SDGs goes beyond Goal 5 and sustainability has acted as a guiding principle across the Statement as a whole. This can be seen in Goal 1 which aims to achieve a strong recovery and sustainable economic development; Goal 2 which aims to promote safety, better pay and conditions, more secure jobs and gender equality in the workplace and Goal 4 which aims to deepen and extend Ireland&rsquo;s Global business and trade in a fair and sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Statement of Strategy my Department has taken responsibility for an additional two targets under the SDG National Implementation Plan. These are target 8.8 which relates to the protection of labour rights, and target 10.a relating to implementation of special and differential treatment for developing countries. These changes in responsibility are reflected in the recently updated SDG Policy Map available on gov.ie. </p></reply>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing their coherent implementation across Government.</p><p>The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets. </p><p>The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie </p><p>Currently the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the lead Department for seven Sustainable Development Goal targets. These are set out below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Target </th>       <th>Description </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8.3 </td>       <td>Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship,  creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8.5 </td>       <td>By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8.8 </td>       <td>Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant   workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8.b </td>       <td>By 2020, develop and operationalize a   global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of   the International Labour Organization</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9.2 </td>       <td>Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry&rsquo;s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10.a </td>       <td>Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12.6 </td>       <td>Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Progress on these targets is mainstreamed into the work of my Department. Progress on targets across Goals 8 and 9 has been made through my Department&rsquo;s enterprise policy set out in Enterprise 2025 Renewed and Future Jobs Ireland 2019 and will continue to be made through the National Economic Recovery Plan. </p><p>In relation to progress on goal 12.6, the Corporate Social Responsibility Stakeholder Forum has been temporarily paused due to reprioritisation of resources due to the Covid-19 pandemic. My Department has begun to explore a number of other avenues to progress this goal in tandem with ongoing action. </p><p>My Department has recently launched a public consultation seeking the views of stakeholders on an EU proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, available at: . The proposal revises the existing EU Non-financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU) extending the scope to all large companies, not just those with over 500 employees, and all companies listed on regulated markets (except listed micro-enterprises). The proposal introduces more detailed reporting requirements and a requirement to report according to mandatory EU sustainability reporting standards and the assurance (audit) of reported information.</p><p>The UN Global Compact has begun initial discussions with my Department and its agencies regarding the establishment of a network here in Ireland &ndash; this would be a very positive development for encouraging sustainable practice among Irish enterprise in making progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal targets, and it is something which my Department will work to facilitate. </p><p>My Department has also been active in relation to the monitoring of progress on the SDGs and is working with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on a publication -  &lsquo;Ireland's UN SDGs &ndash; Goal 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 2021&rsquo; - which will report on Ireland&rsquo;s progress in relation to Goal 8. This work will be published in June 2021. </p></reply>

We have set out in the National Planning Framework how we want to build on the strengths of the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor to capitalise on the clear economic potential of the region. That will involve effectively planning and developing new growth areas, investing in infrastructure and connectivity, and also protecting distinctive landscapes, green spaces and rural activities along the corridor.</p>  <p>  Further, through the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, the Irish Government has made a strong commitment to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to achieve greater connectivity on the island.

Ireland is uniquely positioned to benefit from global investment in fintech. This is due in part to our excellent track record in attracting FDI, our entrepreneurial culture, a strong skills base and an established ecosystem that includes both international financial services and technology firms.</p>  <p>  In order to capitalise on the opportunities for Fintech development in Ireland including developing Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions in light of the legislative elements of the new European Commission Digital Finance Package, the Minister of State for Financial Services recently established a new Fintech Working Group as part of the Ireland for Finance 2021 action plan. Officials from my department will be on this  Working Group, which  will coordinate the approach to fintech across Government to ensure a coordinated and strategic approach to development of the Fintech sector in Ireland, including regional considerations.  As part of its work the group will engage with external stakeholders to build a shared understanding of the various policy and market developments in fintech across policymakers, the fintech community and technological innovations.</p>  <p>  My Department also oversees the development and implementation of Regional Enterprise Plans (REPs), originally launched in 2019, the purpose of which is to identify growth opportunities and strengthen regional enterprise ecosystems to enable job creation in the regions.  REPs complement activities undertaken by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs and the wider range of State Bodies directly involved in supporting enterprise development in the regions.  </p>  <p>  The North-East Regional Enterprise Plan to 2020 included a strategic objective to &lsquo;Drive a higher level of economic success by building on niche strengths and fostering clustering among enterprises&rsquo; which was progressed through establishment of the Fintech Corridor (TFC) in September 2020. There has been continued growth in the cluster which has gained 21 new members and the cluster is supported by a full-time Programme Manager funded by InterTrade Ireland. Current REPs concluded in 2020 and a process to develop new REPs to 2024 has commenced and will identify ongoing growth opportunities and opportunities to further strengthen regional ecosystems.</p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property.</p>  <p>  The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai regarding the U.S. Government&rsquo;s support for a waiver of IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines, is significant. However, the statement acknowledged that reaching agreement on this at the WTO will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The President of the EU Commission has responded to the U.S. announcement by indicating its readiness to discuss the U.S. proposal at the WTO. Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the U.S. proposal for a waiver on intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments in order to achieve the shared goal of providing timely and secure access to safe and affordable vaccines and medicines for all.  There are existing flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement that allows for compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.  Compulsory licenses can cover exports to all countries that lack a manufacturing capability.</p>  <p>  The President of the EU Commission has also identified three other areas which should be pursued to support the global vaccination effort in the short term. Firstly, the issue of exports needs to be addressed to tackle bottlenecks and the lack of vaccines worldwide. The EU has already exported 50% of all vaccines that it has produced.  Secondly, the President of the Commission pointed to the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID vaccines, as the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.  Thirdly, the area of investment in global manufacturing capacity is key, and the EU Commission is supporting a number of initiatives to achieve this. </p></reply>

Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, for terms of up to three years. Loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured and the maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4%. This scheme was made available by repurposing funding originally made available under the Brexit Loan Scheme. The scheme is delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  As of May 7th, 2021, there has been 1,018 loans sanctioned under the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, to a total value of &euro;138.48m.</p>  <p>  Figures for loans availed of per county are provided as part of the quarterly reporting on the scheme. As of the most recent quarterly report (31st December 2020), in county Sligo, 52 businesses had received eligibility approval under the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, with 16 loans drawn to a total value of &euro;1,300,000. In county Leitrim, 24 eligibility codes had so far been approved, and four loans drawn to a total value of &euro;605,000.</p>  <p>  Of these, one tour company in the region applied for and received an eligibility code for the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme. There is no data available on whether this tour company has to date proceeded with an application for lending under this scheme.</p></reply>

Compliance with the 15-day requirement has also been strong among Government Departments with 82% on 80% of invoices received by Government Departments having been paid in 2019 and 2020 within 15-days.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that late payments to suppliers can have a negative impact on business cashflow, I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the establishment of a regulatory body to ensure the enforcement of late payment legislation would likely increase the level of administration and reporting requirements of business.  This would place an increased administrative burden on businesses, particularly the SME sector, as monitoring compliance would require payment history details to be provided by business.  </p>  <p>  The various measures undertaken by my Department and across Government to ensure the terms of the legislation have been observed have gone beyond mere transposition of the Directive and are proving very successful as is evident from the high level of compliance reported.  I can assure the deputy that Officials from my Department will continue through participation in the European Commission&rsquo;s Late Payment Directive Expert Group to seek ways of ensuring compliance with the Directive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.342.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800079#WRJ00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</p>  <p>  The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD) sets annual binding emissions reduction targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. The latest greenhouse gas emissions report, published in January 2021 by the EPA, indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be around 8% below 2005 levels by 2020. The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. According to the EPA&rsquo;s latest report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 11 to 12Mt and we will need to avail of these flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. </p>  <p>  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation EU/2018/842 (ESR) established binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for non-ETS sectors in Member States for the period 2021 to 2030. The ESR sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It is important to note that this target will be amended following the European Council&rsquo;s decision to increase ambition from its existing EU-wide 2030 target of a 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target, including revising Member States&rsquo; existing targets for 2030, are expected to be presented by the European Commission by July 2021.</p>  <p>  In order to meet Ireland&rsquo;s obligations for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive, there are mechanisms under the EU Framework that allow Member States to purchase &lsquo;statistical transfers&rsquo; from other Member States where required to comply with their 2020 obligations.  Given that existing policy measures across the electricity, transport and heat sectors will not be sufficient to achieve compliance with the 2020 target, contingency planning had been underway in my Department for some time on statistical transfers with other Member States. Intensive engagement with a number of Member States took place during 2020. This led to the successful conclusion of negotiations and terms being agreed with two Member States (Denmark and Estonia), which provide for the purchase by Ireland of specified quantities of renewable energy through statistical transfers. </p>  <p>  The total cost of statistical transfers in 2020 was &euro;50 million consisting of: </p>  <p>  - The purchase of a statistical transfer of 1,000 GWh from Denmark costing &euro;12.5 million; and</p>  <p>  - The purchase of a statistical transfer of 2,500 GWh from Estonia costing &euro;37.5 million. </p>  <p>  Additional volumes may be required to be purchased under the Agreements in 2021, depending on the final energy statistics for 2020.</p>  <p>  Under the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, Member States must, from 2021 onwards, maintain the 2020 renewable energy baseline figure (16% in Ireland&rsquo;s case). In addition, Member States should progress along an indicative trajectory with reference points in 2022, 2025, and 2027. If a Member State falls below its baseline, or falls below one or more of its national reference points, the Member State will be required to ensure that additional measures are implemented within one year to cover the gap. These additional measures include increasing the national deployment of renewable energy in the electricity, heating and transport sectors, as well as making a voluntary financial payment to an EU renewable energy financing mechanism, and purchasing of statistical transfers from other Member States. </p>  <p>  It is ultimately the responsibility of each Member State to determine the cost-effective level of renewable energy it should achieve by 2030, as long as it contributes to the achievement of the Union&rsquo;s 2030 target of 32% renewable energy as set out in  National Energy and Climate Plans.  It is expected that the EU-wide 2030 target for renewable energy will increase as part of the forthcoming revision to the Renewable Energy Directive under the EU Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fit for 55 package&rsquo; to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030.</p></reply>

Real-time data from these monitoring stations is available online at all times at www.airquality.ie, and the most recent report on Ireland&rsquo;s air quality can be found at .</p><p>While Ireland has traditionally focused on measurements from monitoring stations to assess air quality, there is a need to provide more local air quality information throughout the country. The intention is that the information generated through monitoring, will be augmented by a newly developed modelling and forecasting capability, which will provide an ongoing air quality forecast service to the public. </p><p>This work is being developed as part of a new EU LIFE funded project called LIFE EMERALD, which commenced in January 2021. By 2024, this modelling project will deliver a national air quality forecast, a near real-time nowcast, and historical modelled maps along with multiple awareness raising and citizen engagement elements.</p><p>In the interim, a further expansion of the network is scheduled during 2021 and 2022 to include another 17 stations, giving a 110 station network, and serving to increase the evidential base required to inform the policy measures necessary to improve the quality of our air. </p></reply>

To support this increased investment, an estimated &euro;9.5 billion will be raised, with revenues ring-fenced, over the decade through annual increases in the rate of carbon tax. My Department is currently preparing a new Climate Action Plan which will set out the policy changes required across every sector to achieve the Programme for Government target of a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that set us on the path of systemic change that is required for Ireland to become a climate-neutral and climate-resilient society and economy no later than 2050.  In parallel, the Government is currently reviewing the National Development Plan, which will ensure that the State&rsquo;s public investment framework, as well as individual capital investment programmes, is aligned with our climate ambition for the next decade. </p>  <p>  To support the achievement of Climate Action Plan and Programme for Government targets, I have made substantial additional funding available in 2021, with &euro;221.5 million provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest annual amount ever made available for these schemes.  This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Climate Action Fund, which was established on a statutory basis in 2020 to provide support for projects, initiatives and research that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets, will invest at least &euro;500 million over the period to 2027.   Almost &euro;185 million has been committed to projects to date.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing proposals to provide further support from the Climate Action Fund through a community climate action programme. The design of this programme will be informed by feedback received through the climate consultation that is currently underway and open until 18 May. Information on the types of projects that may be supported, who may apply for this support, and the application process, will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when the programme is launched shortly. </p>  <p>  In advance of the finalisation of this programme, Creative Ireland, in collaboration with my Department, has launched Creative Climate Action, a competitive fund of up to &euro;2 million supported by the Climate Action Fund and the Creative Ireland Programme.  The fund will support creative and cultural projects up to the end of 2022, connecting people with the profound changes that are happening in our environment, society and economy arising from climate change, with the objective of transforming that connection into behaviour change and climate action. Further information is available at the Creative Ireland website: www.creativeireland.gov.ie </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its Green Enterprise Programme, a flagship initiative of the National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP). The Green Enterprise Programme aims to develop innovative practical applications and solutions (in new/altered products, processes, services or solutions) that prevent waste and stimulate the circular economy.  Funding is provided to projects in the areas of resource efficiency, clean technology, engagement, and behaviour change - from research stage to demonstration and commercial (or community) application. The EPA currently has plans to hold a 2021 call for Green Enterprise projects to be launched in the coming weeks and has allocated &euro;625,000 to new Green Enterprise projects, which includes &euro;250,000 to meet expected commitments arising in 2021, with the remainder (&euro;375,000) for commitments arising in future years.  Depending on the response to the 2021 call, this funding envelope should support approximately 7 to 10 new projects.</p></reply>

This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, submitted an updated NDC on 17 December 2020, which confirmed commitment to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.    This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the enhanced ambition at EU level to increase the EU 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reduction as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s EU 2030 Climate Target Plan, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. To this end, Ireland is one of 12 countries who have signed a joint statement ahead of the European Council in October on strengthening EU climate ambition and agreeing on increasing the 2030 climate target to &ldquo;at least 55 percent&rdquo; this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out significant increased climate ambition for Ireland, committing to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with the EU 2050 ambition. The next iteration of the Climate Action Plan will set out, on an economy-wide basis, how the 2030 ambition in the Programme for Government might be achieved. The Plan will also need to ensure that Ireland  meets its contribution to any increased ambition in a revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU framework which sets Member States&rsquo; emissions reduction targets for 2030.</p></reply>

It limits emissions from more than 11,000 heavy energy-using installations (power stations and large industrial plants), and airlines operating between these countries, covering approximately 45% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. Over 100 stationary installations and 15 aircraft operators currently come within the system in Ireland. The Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for implementation of the ETS in Ireland.    The ETS is currently designed to deliver a reduction of 43% of emissions on an EU-wide basis by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The European Commission is currently preparing legislative proposals to amend the ETS, as part of a suite of measures to ensure the EU meets its increased ambition to reduce overall emissions by at least 55% by 2030 versus 1990 levels.   </p>  <p>  The Commission is expected to publish their proposed revisions to the legislation as part of their 'Fit for 55' Package, which is expected this summer. Ireland will need to consider these proposals once launched and work with the Council Presidency and other Member States to form an agreed Council position.</p></reply>

An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie My Department has responsibility for leading implementation of:- SDG 7 &lsquo;Affordable and clean energy&rsquo;;- SDG 12 &lsquo;Responsible consumption and production&rsquo;, with input from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE); and - SDG 13 &lsquo;Climate Action&rsquo;. </p><p>Progress across the three Goals is illustrated below:</p><p>Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy</p><p>As part of our commitment to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030, and be carbon-neutral by 2050, a number of strategies are being developed by my Department to increase the share of renewable energy used across the residential, industrial, and transport sectors, ensuring affordable and clean energy for all of Irish society. These include:</p><p>- the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS);</p><p>- residential and community retrofit programmes;</p><p>- Micro-generation Support Scheme; and</p><p>- a new Solar Energy Strategy.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office has prepared a progress report on Goal 7 with the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland as part of our regular monitoring process, and highlights the progress that Ireland has made on renewable energy in recent years. The report is available on the CSO website at:</p><p>Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production</p><p>My Department supports a number of programmes and initiatives to underpin the strategic advancement of a circular and sustainable approach to using biological resources. </p><p>Published in 2020, the new Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy sets a roadmap for achieving sustainability through shifting focus away from waste disposal to looking at how we can preserve resources by creating a circular economy. A Waste Action Plan Advisory Group has also been established, consisting of relevant stakeholders from the economic, environmental and social sectors. The Group assisted in the compilation of the new policy by guiding strategic thinking and decision making and will assist in implementing the commitments in the Plan.</p><p>In April of this year, my Department also launched a public consultation on Ireland&rsquo;s first Whole-of-Government Circular Economy Strategy. The draft Strategy provides a policy framework for Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become one of the leaders in relation to the Circular Economy in Europe. The consultation period will end on 11 June 2021.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s annual financial contributions to the Global Environment Facility and to the UN Environment Programme provide support to sustainability projects globally.</p><p>Goal 13: Climate action </p><p>The Government is committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. A key aspect of delivering on this ambition will be enacting the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which will be reinforced by credible on-going policy. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets and related sectoral targets will be set, with every sector contributing, while also ensuring we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on the transition to a climate neutral economy and society. Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action.</p><p>The annual revision to the Climate Action Plan acts as a further review mechanism and opportunity to re-adjust or refocus actions, if required, to ensure targets are achieved. The Climate Action Plan 2021 will set out the policy, measure and actions that must be taken across every economic sector to ensure we deliver on our increased climate ambition as set out in the Programme for Government.</p><p>At an international level, the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the support of my Department and the Department of Finance, are developing a new Climate Finance Strategy, with Ireland having already committed to doubling its annual contribution to the Green Climate Fund from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million from 2020 onwards.</p></reply>

Our communications approach is designed to enhance our reputation and build trust through collaboration and engagement. Social media is a critical tool in achieving these objectives, and we place a high value on ensuring that our social media channels are actively engaged with citizens on issues that are important to them.    The Communications and Media Relations Division is responsible for managing my Department&rsquo;s social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Given the dynamic and far-reaching nature of social media, managing these five channels in an effective manner requires significant resources.</p>  <p>  The core social media team consists of 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Administrative Officer and 1 Executive Officer. Each of these staff members carries out social media duties as one part of their wider communications function, which also encompasses strategic communications, public outreach, customer service and media relations. The social media team is responsible for content development for social media (including written, graphic and video content), social media planning, and social media promotion, monitoring and analysis, as well as customer service online where required. The team monitors engagement and notifications on each platform daily, responding where necessary. If required, the team will monitor and report on engagement and reaction to specific initiatives and announcements. The time commitment related to this work can vary depending on communications priorities, but is estimated at about two hours per day collectively.</p></reply>

For 2021, the combined budget for these schemes is over &euro;50 million. Under both of these schemes the central priority is building energy efficiency, and projects are required to demonstrate a building fabric first approach. Solar panels can be supported as part of wider package of home energy upgrades. Funding for energy poor homes within projects can cover up to 80% of the total costs of the upgrades.</p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets using surplus emissions credits from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already met its emissions targets from 2013 to 2018. However, the latest greenhouse gas emissions report, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2021, indicates that Ireland will cumulatively exceed the 2019 and 2020 annual targets by approximately 11 to 12Mt. Ireland will, therefore, need to purchase additional allowances to meet the projected shortfall.    In anticipation of a requirement for the State to purchase carbon credits in partial fulfilment of Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol and ongoing obligations, in 2007 the Carbon Fund Act established a carbon fund and empowered the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to undertake such purchases on behalf of the State. As the designated purchasing agent on behalf of the State, the NTMA administers and manages purchases of carbon credits. Details of all transactions entered into by the NTMA are published annually in a Carbon Fund Report at www.ntma.ie  in accordance with section 6 of the Carbon Fund Act 2007.</p>  <p>  Any requirement to use already purchased or additional credits for compliance under the ESD will be undertaken in accordance with all relevant regulations as set out by the European Union, the European Commission, the United Nations and all relevant international agreements.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot obtain a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver this is underway. </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 13 May 2021, over 215,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. In County Cork, premises have been surveyed or surveys are ongoing in the areas of Midelton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon, Kilpatrick, Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Main works are ongoing in Carrigaline, Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown and Upper Rochestown. Pre-build works are ongoing in Midleton. NBI has advised that the premises referred to, located in the  Minane Bridge area, is available for pre-order and NBI anticipate that high speed broadband  should be available in the area in the coming months. The premises referred to in the Bandon area will also be served by the NBP State led intervention but it is not possible to provide a definitive timeframe for availability as yet.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website, www.nbi.ie, which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 13 May, 315 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP sites connected in Cork include Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Clogagh Community Hall (located 12.36 Kilometres from the premises located in the Bandon area), Ballindangan Community Centre, T.O. Park Labbamollaga, Glash Community Centre, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre and Whitechurch Community Centre. Further details can be found at . </p><p>Clogagh National  School and Ballycroneen National School are planned  as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at . </p></reply>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was consulted as part of this process.The goal of the Charter is to ensure that every Local Authority embeds decarbonisation, sustainable development and climate resilience into every aspect of the work they do.  The Charter acknowledges the need to take collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change, while also committing Local Authorities to being advocates for climate action.Under the Charter, Local Authorities will measure the carbon impact of activities and implement measures to reduce carbon emissions in line with national objectives, including a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.</p><p>In 2018, my Department entered into a five year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs).  Cork County Council is the lead authority for the Atlantic Seaboard South region, which also includes the Local Authorities for counties <font color="#0A0A0A">Clare, Limerick and Kerry, as well as Cork City</font>. My Department engages with all four CAROs on a regular basis, in particular through participation in the National Local Authority Climate Action Steering Group. Under the National Adaptation Framework, each Local Authority has developed a Local Adaptation Strategy. These strategies are now being implemented, and each CARO is working with the Local Authorities in its region to both facilitate and monitor implementation of the local climate adaptation actions within the strategies. </p><p>The Climate Action Bill further strengthens the role of Local Authorities in climate action. It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to prepare a Climate Action Plan, which will include both mitigation and adaptation measures and be updated every five years. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other in the preparation of these plans.</p><p>To build the necessary capacity, my Department is also funding and engaging with the CAROs in relation to the implementation of a new Local Authority climate action training programme. This programme is increasing knowledge of climate change and the need for action among all Local Authority staff, and will facilitate both climate mitigation and adaptation at local level.</p></reply>

My Department has ensured that the open consultation period is long enough to support widespread engagement.</p><p>In order to accommodate the two-way dialogue that a process like this requires, my Department worked closely with Local Authorities and Public Participation Networks to organise virtual discussion forums, in order to give the opportunity to individuals and communities across all regions to have their say. As part of this process my Department conducted 28 virtual worskhops across 26 counties. This included 18 Public Participation Network sessions, organised with the support of the Local Authorities, and 12 youth conversations, organised with the support of For&oacute;ige and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g. In addition, two in-depth dialogue sessions were held, with almost 50 householders, community representatives, NGO representatives and students. My officials conducted briefings and information sessions with Environmental NGOs and stakeholders to promote and discuss the consultation.</p><p>In terms of wider communications, my Department has invested a great deal of time and resources into ensuring that this consultation is highly visible and that the public are encouraged to participate. This includes the following promotional activities:</p><p>- A national radio campaign, broadcast in a burst when the consultation first opened, and targeted at citizens who may be less active online or on social media. This campaign achieved an audience reach of 750,000, representing over half the radio listenership of the selected stations nationally.</p><p>- Regular media engagement from myself and my Government colleagues, including print, TV, radio and podcasts, aimed at a variety of audiences.</p><p>- A 6-week social media campaign across Facebook and Instagram, targeted at the 16-35 age groups, and utilising a variety of content including video, Instagram Stories and static posts. The performance of this campaign up to the end of April was as follows:  Reach: 812,754; Impressions: 4,674,247; Post engagements: 19,402.</p><p>An ongoing organic campaign across Twitter and Linked In, targeting specific themes related to the consultation, including Home, Travel, Waste and Community. A summary of these organic posts is contained in the table below.</p><p>In addition, my Department has leveraged the communications network across government and the wider public sector to ensure all messages around participation in the Climate Conversation consultation are shared and amplified. </p></reply>

From 1 January 2019 to date, a total of &euro;13,389,593 of grant supports have been provided for the supply and installation of solar PV panels and all ancillary equipment. This has allowed a total of 19.8 MW capacity to be installed across 5,506 installations, and has brought a carbon saving of 5,206 tonnes of CO2 in the same period.     </p>  <p>  The grants administered by the SEAI assist homeowners in privately engaging contractors to install solar PV works. A Declaration of Works is provided by scheme participants to the SEAI, on which data concerning the brand and quantity of panels installed is recorded. All installers must meet the standards specified by the SEAI's Domestic Technical Standards and Specifications document and the Domestic Solar Photovoltaic Code of Practice for Installers. Both of these documents are available on the SEAI website. </p>  <p>  As the solar PV market in Ireland is relatively small and dominated by a few key players, SEAI do not disclose specific details regarding the origins of products, as in some cases this information may disclose the brand of panel used and so offer information to market competitors regarding the activities of individual contractors. </p></reply>

The SDG Plan included a commitment to prepare a new sustainable development strategy to replace Our Sustainable Future, which remained Ireland&rsquo;s national sustainable development strategy in 2018. A review of actions that were not fully achieved during the lifetime of the first SDG National Implementation Plan was recently undertaken, to inform preparation of the next SDG Plan due for publication later this year. While a new sustainable development strategy was not completed during the period of the first SDG Plan, the national policy space surrounding sustainable development has evolved significantly since the SDG National Implementation Plan was adopted in 2018, and a number of complementary Government plans and strategies have been produced which include targeted actions and measures to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable development objectives. Some further details on these policies which my Department are leading on are set out below:    -The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement require transformational shift across all sectors towards a climate resilient and sustainable economy and society. The Climate Action Plan 2019, published in June 2019, provided the first framework of actions necessary across all sectors to deliver the integrated policy required to achieve our 2030 EU climate targets (which are to be revised upwards shortly) and put us on a pathway to climate neutrality by 2030.</p>  <p>  - A public consultation was launched in March 2021 to inform the Climate Action Plan 2021, which will build on the Climate Action Plan 2019, and provide additional actions necessary to meet the Programme for Government climate ambition, as well as ensuring we meet any revised EU targets.</p>  <p>  - In September 2020, the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy was published, which provides Ireland&rsquo;s new roadmap for waste planning and management. The Plan outlines the contribution of the sector to support the achievement of a number of other national plans and policies including the Climate Action Plan. It also matches the level of ambition being shown across the European Union through the European Green Deal, which encompasses a range of actions supporting circularity and sustainability.

Achieving sustainable development, and particularly the targets and commitments set out in the 17 SDGs, will require not only action by Government but all individuals across society. </p><p>The first National Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs and committed the Government to establish a national Sustainable Development Goals Stakeholder Forum.</p><p>The National SDG Stakeholder Forum brings together organisations and individuals to discuss and workshop innovative ideas and solutions for achieving the SDGs in Ireland.</p><p>Six meetings of the National Stakeholder Forum have taken place to date, with two meetings in 2018 and four further meetings in 2019.

An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and associated Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie </p><p>A roadmap and timeline for completion of the new Plan is currently being finalised, with publication envisaged later this year.

This year, we have seen a significant increase in funding, in line with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of Active Travel and Greenways. I was delighted to announce earlier this year an allocation of &euro;240 million to Active Travel projects in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and the four regional cities, along with an additional &euro;72.8 million to projects in the other local authorities. The latter funding stream constitutes the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland. An additional &euro;50 million has been allocated to the Department&rsquo;s Greenways programme. This increase in funding will not only support the construction and improvement of walking and cycling infrastructure but also the deployment of almost 250 Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase active travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country. In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme earlier this year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. Around &euro;15 million will be allocated to this Programme in 2021 and it has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;15 million has been allocated by my Department to an 'Additional Outdoor Infrastructure Fund' to help ensure a Safe Outdoor Summer. The funding will support local authorities in enhancing outdoor urban space and improving walking and cycling infrastructure through short term measures. This will assist the safe outdoor re-opening of society as Ireland gradually emerges from current COVID-19 public health restrictions. This Fund will be administered by the NTA on behalf of the Department and the deadline for applications passed last week, on 14th May 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, I was delighted to recently announce the launch of a three-year pilot initiative along with my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Joe O'Brien TD, for the provision of high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes for those on low incomes and/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged. Funding of &euro;1 million per annum is being provided by my Department for this initiative over a three-year period and will be made available through the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s Community Services Programme.</p>  <p>  The step-change in funding committed in Budget 2021 and the introduction of numerous innovative measures to encourage Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country. </p></reply>

It contains an option to extend for a period(s) up to a further 3 years.  The contract has been extended initially for one year to July 2023 to facilitate the procurement of a new service in accordance with Public Spending Code requirements and a seamless transition from one service to another. </p><p>In November 2019 the Department of Transport commenced a process to prepare for the next iteration of the Coast Guard Aviation service. This involved an extensive consultation process with all key State and other SAR stakeholders to consider the scope and demand for the service over the lifetime of a new contract. </p><p>An initial report was brought to Government in July last, following approval by a Steering Group of State stakeholders. This report included a strategic assessment, setting out the context for the SAR aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme. It identified the spending objectives of the programme, including existing arrangements and relevant business needs. It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options. The process is now at detailed business case stage which is focused on the remaining viable options. While it is not envisaged that the Air Corps take full responsibility for this service on the basis of that initial assessment, my Department was asked by the Department of Defence to explore the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service.</p><p>The Air Corps submission that the Deputy refers to was received by my Department last March and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a detailed business case on the entire IRCG aviation service. This is part of a deliberative process which will lead to a Government decision in due course and on which it would not be appropriate for me to comment.</p><p>To be clear, I have no role in the business case development. This is being led by KPMG and a Project Team which includes officials in my Department and independent expertise. The outcome of this will be brought to Government shortly.</p><p>All relevant and reliable information on the current status of this project can be found on our dedicated SAR Webpage &ndash; </p></reply>

The Department understands the frustration at this decision, however, these restrictions imposed by the Government based on the advice of NPHET and their panel of scientific experts, are in place to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on this country and its people. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  Because the service was closed for long periods of time over the last year, a large backlog of customers has built up. To deal with the backlog, the RSA have plans to increase capacity when it is allowed to re-open. This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses. This will be extended to car drivers when services resume, initially with 3,200 online tests being conducted per month. Online services will be made more widely available towards the end of 2021.</p></reply>

I am pleased to advise that on 19 March 2021, following a tendering process, Clinchmaritime Ltd. was selected as the preferred supplier to undertake this important review. The key aims of the review are to assess the current organisational structures for marine casualty investigation in Ireland and to set out in a report to me, as Minister for Transport, any recommendations, including in relation to change, to achieve the most appropriate and effective marine casualty investigation structures for Ireland, taking into account national, EU and international obligations. </p>  <p>  Clinchmaritime Ltd. is headed by Captain Steve Clinch, who is widely recognised as an international expert with extensive experience in all aspects of marine casualty investigation. Captain Clinch was the Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents of the UK&rsquo;s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) between 2010 and 2018.  He has been involved in over 350 safety investigations.  In addition to being Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents in the MAIB, Captain Clinch has also chaired both the European Union&rsquo;s Permanent Cooperation Framework (PCF) for Member State&rsquo;s marine accident investigative bodies under Directive 2009/18/EC and the Marine Accident Investigators&rsquo; International Forum (MAIIF).  These international roles required extensive and regular engagement with marine accident investigative bodies and stakeholders from various jurisdictions and a comprehensive understanding of the EU and international marine casualty investigation regulatory framework. Captain Clinch also has experience transposing EU legislation and during his time chairing the PCF he worked with Member States and the EU Commission to develop regulations to establish the common methodology for investigating marine casualties and incidents.  </p>  <p>  I understand that Captain Clinch is making good progress on the review and he has engaged with a number of key stakeholders already, including the Marine Casualty Investigation Board and marine accident investigation bodies from other jurisdictions, the European Maritime Safety Agency, industry stakeholders and the accident investigation bodies for rail and air in Ireland. It is expected that the review and report will be delivered to me in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In addition, my officials initiated a public consultation on 29 March 2021, seeking views from the public (or any other interested stakeholder) on matters relevant to the review. The consultation was published on the gov.ie website through its dedicated &lsquo;consultation&rsquo; page. In addition, the Department published a Marine Notice on the gov.ie website which was also actively emailed to approximately 700 email addresses (consisting of persons or organisations who have expressed an interest in receiving notifications on maritime issues) on the Department&rsquo;s Marine Notice mailing list. The Department advertised the consultation via its official Twitter account, which has just over 2,200 followers and officials also contacted additional marine stakeholders directly to provide information on the review and seek submissions as part of the consultation process.  Furthermore, following a request, the Department extended the deadline for submissions from 21 April 2021 to 14 May 2021 to provide additional time for interested parties to engage on the matter. The submissions received as part of this public consultation will form an input into Captain Clinch&rsquo;s review.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise that my Department and I are continuing to engage with the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks with a view to progressing the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2020, which seeks to ensure and enable the continued functioning of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in the immediate term.</p></reply>

This involved an extensive consultation process with all key State and other SAR stakeholders to consider the scope and demand for the service over the lifetime of a new contract. </p>  <p>  An initial report was brought to Government in July last, following approval by a Steering Group of State stakeholders. This report included a strategic assessment, setting out the context for the SAR aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme. It identified the spending objectives of the programme, including existing arrangements and relevant business needs. It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options. The process is now at detailed business case stage which is focused on the remaining viable options. While it is not envisaged that the Air Corps take full responsibility for this service on the basis of that initial assessment, my Department was asked by the Department of Defence to explore the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps submission that the Deputy refers to was received by my Department last March and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a detailed business case on the entire IRCG aviation service. This is part of a deliberative process which will lead to a Government decision in due course and on which it would not be appropriate for me to comment.</p>  <p>  To be clear, I have no role in the business case development. This is being led by KPMG and a Project Team which includes officials in my Department and independent expertise. The outcome of this will be brought to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  All relevant and reliable information on the current status of this project can be found on our dedicated SAR Webpage &ndash; Irish Coast Guard: Search and Rescue (SAR) Aviation Project.</p></reply>

The Department understands the frustration at this decision, however, these restrictions imposed by the Government based on the advice of NPHET and their panel of scientific experts, are in place to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on this country and its people. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  Because the service was closed for long periods of time over the last year, a large backlog of customers has built up. To deal with the backlog, the RSA have plans to increase capacity when it is allowed to re-open. This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses. This will be extended to car drivers when services resume, initially with 3,200 online tests being conducted per month. Online services will be made more widely available towards the end of 2021.</p></reply>

Gross motor tax receipts in 2020 were in the order of &euro;940m. Maintenance of the tax base would, therefore, require a significant compensatory increase in fuel excise rates, with direct negative impacts on the rate of inflation and economic competitiveness.   </p>  <p>  Goods vehicles and other high usage and high mileage vehicles, such as public service vehicles and buses, would have higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system. There would be other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute.  </p>  <p>  A significant increase in fuel duty could lead to an increase in cross-border fuel purchasing, further depressing the tax base and requiring a compensatory adjustment, either in further increases in fuel prices or elsewhere in the tax system, to make up the shortfall. The potential for an increase in fuel laundering is also clear.   </p>  <p>  A mechanism would also have to be put in place to ensure that the National Vehicle and Driver File, the central vehicle register, could be kept up to date in the absence of the requirement to renew motor tax on, at least, an annual basis. </p>  <p>  Further, the Programme for Government 2020 contains a commitment to legislate to ban the registration of new fossil-fuelled cars and light vehicles from 2030 onwards, and to phase out diesel and petrol cars from Irish cities from 2030. There is also a commitment in the Climate Action Plan to accelerate the take up of electric vehicles to achieve a target of some 950,000 such vehicles on the road by 2030.   </p>  <p>  The benefits of a fuel based tax would have to be weighed against all of these policy considerations and objectives before the change proposed could be contemplated. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment under my Department's Regional and Local Road Grant Programme at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.  </p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that Louth County Council have been focussed on seeking funding for the proposed Port Access Northern Cross Route (PANCR) under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG). There was some discussion between Louth County Council and my Department in early 2020 regarding the project appraisal process if the scheme were to be submitted to my Department for consideration. To date no application has been received by this Department from Louth County Council in relation to the proposed PANCR.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the scope for considering any new significant road improvement projects is dependent on the outcome of the NDP review.</p></reply>

The Department understands the frustration at this decision, however, these restrictions imposed by the Government based on the advice of NPHET and their panel of scientific experts, are in place to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on this country and its people. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  Because the service was closed for long periods of time over the last year, a large backlog of customers has built up. To deal with the backlog, the RSA have plans to increase capacity when it is allowed to re-open. This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog. </p>  <p>  The RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses. This will be extended to car drivers when services resume, initially with 3,200 online tests being conducted per month. Online services will be made more widely available towards the end of 2021.</p></reply>

Updates around the resumption of tests will be published on www.theorytest.ie. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) recognise that it will take time to meet the demand of the backlog that has built up and restore waiting times to their pre-Covid level. The Authority is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services resume, such as:</p>  <p>  - an increase in capacity within the service, which will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog of customers.</p>  <p>  - delivery of an online driver theory test service. The rollout of online theory tests for cars is planned for June 2021. There will be a limit on the number of customers that can avail of the service during the initial rollout phase, but work is ongoing to make online services more widely available towards the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  All enquires relating to driver licensing are handled by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), the provision of which I have delegated to the Road Safety Authority (RSA) under the relevant legislation.

In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities. </p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>The terms of the Scheme set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18  June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p><p>On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence.</p><p>Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year. On foot of that review new proposals will be brought forward for consideration.</p><p>Further information on supports available to persons with disabilities can be found at</p><p>https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/guides/guide_to_entitlements_for_people_with_disabilities.html </p></reply>

Currently, capital allowances are available at 12.5% p.a. over eight years for agricultural equipment generally.  The scheme will provide for ACAs at 50% p.a. over two years for eligible specified farm safety and adaptive equipment for the purpose of preventing accidents or facilitating farmers&rsquo; return to work following an accident. The scheme will be subject to a scheme total equipment cost of &euro;5 million p.a. ex VAT.</p>  <p>  The section is subject to a commencement order. This was to allow for ensuring compliance with EU State Aid rules and for various operational aspects of the scheme to be developed and put in place. The work to achieve this is currently being undertaken by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Revenue.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, as the scheme is one that will take into account expenditure across a full year, the expectation is that, once the relevant provision is commenced, relief will be available for relevant expenditure incurred in the current year.</p></reply>

The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. REITs are required to distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to investors. Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at a rate of 25% must be applied to a REIT&rsquo;s distributions, other than those distributed to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  While not referred to specifically in the Deputies question, the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime is also of relevance in relation to the Irish property market. Finance Act 2016 introduced the IREF regime to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors, thereby avoiding a charge to tax on profits arising from Irish real estate. The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place - again these are generally gross roll-up regimes where tax is accounted for on distribution, for example the taxation of pensions paid out to pensioners.</p>  <p>  In 2019, officials in my Department produced a report on REITs and IREFs as respects their investment in the Irish property market.  The report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group and published in July 2019. It provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019. </p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.</p>  <p>  Institutional investment in commercial and residential property is critically important to generating additional supply of property in Ireland through forward-funding of development projects, particularly in the area of high-density urban developments such as apartment buildings. Rebuilding Ireland identified the encouragement of the build-to-rent sector as a key factor in improving the rental sector and acknowledged that institutional investors have the potential to provide significant investment in such projects. </p>  <p>  However I would note that I do not support the bulk purchase of completed homes by institutional investors, and I am currently working together with the Minister for Housing  to develop targeted measures to address this issue, and to direct institutional funding towards developments generating real additional supply for Irish households.</p></reply>

Under domestic legislation, professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health and Children are exempt from VAT. Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health and Children are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries. This includes health professionals registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Nurses Act 1985 and those engaged in a regulated profession designated under Section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument No. 170 of 2018 (Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Regulations 2018) of 2 July 2018 designates psychotherapists and counsellors as a regulated profession and establishes the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board. Professional counselling and psychotherapy services provided by persons registered by this Board are exempt from VAT from the date of their registration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the then Minister for Health, Simon Harris TD, appointed the thirteen members of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board with effect from 25 February 2019.</p>  <p>  The Board has begun the substantial body of work which must be undertaken before it is in a position to open its registers. Questions on the establishment of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board and their progress in opening their register are a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

However, it represents just one part of a multi-pronged approach to addressing our housing issues. Rebuilding Ireland identified the encouragement of the build-to-rent sector as a key priority in improving the supply of accommodation in urban areas along with the professionalization of our rental sector. The forward investment provided by institutional investors provides essential capital for this sector. </p>  <p>  This is particularly the case in relation to apartments, where the volume of investment by institutional investors has coincided with a significant increase in output. Apartments accounted for 19 per cent of all completions last year, an increase from 12 per cent in 2016. According to CBRE, the level of forward commit investment by institutional investors (i.e. the provision capital to fund the construction of new dwellings) totalled &euro;2.07bn in 2019 and 2020 (just over 50 per cent of their total investment in the market).</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the property crash, institutional investors facilitated the completion of many residential and commercial developments.  In more recent years, institutional investors have provided essential forward-funding for the development of apartment buildings.</p>  <p>  However, the bulk purchase of completed homes by institutional investors is a matter of concern, and it is not intended that such investors should be in competition with individual buyers for completed homes.  The government is working to develop targeted measures to address this issue, and to ensure institutional funding is directed towards generating real additional supply for Irish households.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, while it is important to facilitate institutional investment through appropriate regimes it is equally important to ensure that, where such investment brings a profit, a fair share of tax is paid. </p>  <p>  In recent Finance Bills, I have made significant changes to the taxation of funds investing in Irish property, in particular Irish Real Estate Funds, to ensure that appropriate tax is collected.  As with investment funds generally, tax occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the fund, but there is a withholding tax on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.  The increase in tax receipts since these changes were introduced shows the effectiveness of these measures. </p></reply>

It consists of approximately 45 individual programmes, not including administrative expenditure for the European Parliament, Commission, Council and other EU agencies. The MFF is broken down into seven Headings of expenditure - Single Market, Innovation and Digital; Cohesion, Resilience and Values; Natural Resources and Environment; Migration and Border Management; Security and Defence; Neighbourhood and the World; and European Administration. Any bilateral contributions to other EU programmes, outside of the EU Budget/MFF made by a Government Department are the responsibility of that Department. </p><p>Contributions to the EU budget are general and are not assigned to specific programmes. Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget for the years 2015 &ndash; 2020 are as follows:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Contribution &euro;m</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>1,952</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>2,023</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>2,016</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2,519</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,432</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2,569</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the 2021-2027 MFF are expected to rise over the coming period, from approximately &euro;3.25 billion in 2021, to approximately &euro;3.95 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.6 billion per annum. </p><p>On 21 July 2020, Heads of State and Government reached agreement on the &euro;1.074 trillion Post-2020 MFF and the supplementary &euro;750 billion recovery plan &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo; (NGEU), totalling &euro;1.82 trillion. At this time of crisis, the Covid recovery funds are needed now, and will be received by Member States up to 2026, but will be paid back over 30+ years. Repayments to the NGEU, will be made alongside the MFF, but are not expected to begin for a number of years yet. The contribution Ireland will make has yet to be determined and will depend on our share of the overall EU budget over the course of those repayments.  They will also depend on what new Own Resources, if any,  are agreed at EU level.

The SDGs are a global blueprint for collective progress to a more prosperous and sustainable world by 2030. The SDGs are applicable to all countries, developed and developing, and action is required for their implementation both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Political oversight for national SDG implementation is provided through the Cabinet, with each Minister having specific responsibility for implementing individual SDG targets related to their Ministerial functions. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing their coherent implementation across Government.</p><p>The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, sets out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. The Goals are mainstreamed in domestic policy and the governance structure reflects a whole-of-Government approach and ensures coordination and coherence, in particular where goals cover areas of shared responsibility.</p><p>Nineteen actions were included in the first National Implementation Plan. Action 4 of the Plan set out a commitment to include reference to SDG targets in all new Statements of Strategy.  </p><p>My Department published its Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 in January 2021, it can be found at the following link:  https://assets.gov.ie/122270/1d8bd1ca-295f-42b2-9998-1c83ae04e716.pdf .</p><p>The Statement of Strategy is informed and guided by the Department&rsquo;s commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s National Implementation Plan which implements the UN SDGs and specific reference is made to the SDGs. The Statement plays an important role in the delivery of policy objectives insofar as it provides a framework to translate such objectives into policies and operational business plans designed to achieve implementation. My Department's obligations in respect of the achievement of SDGs have therefore been embedded within the fabric of how it does its business. It is my hope that these steps towards enhanced policy coherence, alignment and mainstreaming of SDGs into policy areas will contribute to an accelerated progression towards SDG implementation.</p><p>An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets. </p><p>The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at  </p><p>As the Deputy will note, the targets assigned to the Department of Finance as either lead or stakeholder extend across a wide range of its business and activities ranging from promoting inclusive economic growth to building partnerships for sustainable development. My Department has published these obligations online. https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/032fa-sustainable-development-goals/ . In relation to the update on implementation progress the Deputy has sought, I have appended a summary in tabular form.</p><p>Moving forward, I can assure the Deputy of my Department&rsquo;s continued focus and commitment to the whole of Government approach in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. </p></reply>

Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.   </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

A requirement for all members of the Fund. This process assesses a country&rsquo;s economic and financial developments, including discussions with the Country's economic and financial policies with Government and Central Bank officials.  This follows the unfortunate, but understandable, suspension of the IMF&rsquo;s overall surveillance in 2020 resulting from Covid which meant that Ireland&rsquo;s planned 2020 Article IV review could not proceed. </p>  <p>  As part of the 2021 Article IV consultation, the IMF held a series of constructive and engaging meetings with myself, Minister McGrath and our officials over the course of the two weeks between 26 April and 7 May. The IMF&rsquo;s preliminary findings, which form the basis of the Article IV Report due to be published later this year, were made available in the form of a &lsquo;Concluding Statement&rsquo; published on the IMF website on 12 May 2021. The Article IV process provides a valuable outside perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s medium to long-term economic prospects and I look forward to receiving the IMF&rsquo;s more detailed assessment in the full Article IV Report. The IMF also undertook an Article IV consultation with the euro area in 2020. This provided further opportunities to engage with the IMF Managing Director, who presented the outcome of the IMF&rsquo;s consultation at Eurogroup on 30 November 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to participating in the Fund&rsquo;s bilateral surveillance, I attended the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings 2020 last October and the recent IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings 2021 in April, both held in virtual format. As part of these events, I participated in meetings with the IMF Managing Director and European policy-makers to discuss current policy challenges. As part of these meetings, I also attended the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund Committee (IMFC), the body responsible for providing strategic direction to the work and policies of the Fund.</p>  <p>  This engagement was supplemented with a series of bilateral calls with the IMF Managing Director and the Executive Director of Ireland&rsquo;s Constituency at the Fund throughout 2020. Officials in my Department continue to engage with the IMF on an ongoing basis, primarily through Ireland&rsquo;s representatives based in our Constituency Office in Washington D.C. This ongoing engagement and collaboration is particularly valuable as it allows Ireland to benefit from the Fund&rsquo;s insights into the challenges and opportunities we face and to utilise the IMF&rsquo;s extensive experience and expertise to inform our macroeconomic and financial policy-making.</p>  <p>  With respect to the second part of your question, I understand that the IMF has been covering health risks in all its country-specific assessments. The pandemic&rsquo;s impact on lives and livelihoods is clearly macro-critical and therefore falls within the Fund&rsquo;s focus. Moreover, international cooperation on these efforts is critical in today&rsquo;s globally integrated economy, in which the policies of one country can affect many others. I can assure you that the pandemic has been the predominant theme of the majority of my discussions with the IMF Managing Director and Fund management over the last year.</p></reply>

The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax.</p><p>An Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) is an investment undertaking, or a sub-fund, which derives 25% or more of its market value from assets deriving their value directly or indirectly from real estate in the State.  IREFs are subject to a 20% IREF withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Irish resident individuals/corporates are separately subject to investment undertakings tax.  Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place.</p><p>Details of the total profits arising to IREFs for the periods 2017, 2018 and 2019 are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Table 1 Details of total profits arising to IREFs</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017 &euro;</th>       <th>2018 &euro;</th>       <th>2019 &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Operating Profit</td>       <td>911,833,875</td>       <td>867,739,813</td>       <td>1,159,450,861</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit Before Tax as per Financial Statements</td>       <td>690,641,103</td>       <td>498,299,253</td>       <td>724,795,840</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Taxation is levied in respect of IREFs at the point of distribution of profits to investors.  I am advised by Revenue that IREFs are required to make returns and payments of IREF withholding tax in respect of taxable events occurring during a specified period i.e. when a unit holder receives value for the accrued profits of the IREF. There are a number of situations where a taxable event arises but in most cases this will be on the making of a cash or a non-cash distribution to a unit holder or on the cancellation, redemption or repurchase of units from a unit holder. IREFs are not obliged to separately report the source of the profits attributable to the IREF taxable event on the IREF return. Given the profits of an IREF are generated from various property related activities, including for example property development, property sales, rental income and service charges, Revenue does not have a breakdown of the profits deriving specifically from rental and related income for the periods in question.  </p><p>Details of the IREF withholding tax, calculated on the amount of a taxable event (for example a distribution to a unit holder) paid for each period is set out in Table 2.Additionally, investment undertaking tax (IUT) rather that IREF withholding tax may be applicable if the investor is Irish Resident.</p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Details of IREF withholding tax and income tax paid by IREFs</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017 &euro; </th>       <th>2018 &euro; </th>       <th>2019 &euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF Taxable Amount</td>       <td>44,666,427</td>       <td>212,776,714</td>       <td>368,463,650</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF Withholding Tax paid</td>       <td>8,321,359</td>       <td>28,229,097 </td>       <td>65,759,048 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Income tax charge paid*</td>       <td>n/a </td>       <td>n/a </td>       <td>6,211,720</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*  The Finance Act 2019 contained a number of anti-avoidance measures for IREFs. IREFs are regarded as having income subject to income tax where they have excessive debt or expenses that are not wholly or exclusively for the purpose of their business.  Any excessive amounts are regarded as deemed income of the IREF and chargeable to income tax at 20%. No losses, deficits, expenses or allowances may be set off against such income for the purpose of determining the chargeable amount. For the three month period to 31 December 2019, income tax was paid as shown in Table 2.</p></reply>

The scheme is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D. </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to help qualifying businesses meet their costs at a time when they cannot provide goods or services to their customers from their business premises, or can only do so to a limited extent, due to COVID-19 related restrictions. For the purposes of the scheme, a business premises is defined as a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. The legislation also provides that a claim for the CRSS cannot be made later than eight weeks from the date on which the &lsquo;claim period&rsquo; commences.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question applied to register for the CRSS on 3 May 2021. Once registered, the business was eligible to claim CRSS payments from 15 March 2021 (i.e. eight weeks prior to 3 May 2021), provided it was prohibited or significantly restricted in allowing customers access its premises throughout that period. Revenue has confirmed that payments have correctly issued to the business in respect of all &lsquo;claim periods&rsquo; since 15 March 2021. It is not possible to provide CRSS payments to the business for periods earlier than this date. </p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. </p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle to Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, for example:</p>  <p>  - The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.</p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer.</p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.</p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.</p>  <p>  The cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers. Therefore the cost of the existing scheme and of any potential changes can only be estimates.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of child seats and trailers in the scheme or the extension of the scheme beyond employees would create an additional cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere.  The additional cost would depend on the marginal rate of tax of individual taxpayers benefitting from the expansion of the scheme, the cost of the seats and trailers and the effect of the cap on the amount of marginal benefit available.  </p>  <p>  For that reason, while the scheme is kept under review by officials, I have no plans at present for its expansion.</p>  <p>  Further guidance regarding the cycle to work scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

These include various tax-exempted child-care related supports provided by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  With regard to taxation measures, and separate to the above:</p>  <p>  - The Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees.</p>  <p>  - Individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home may claim childcare services relief each year, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income.</p>  <p>  - Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.</p>  <p>  In relation to taxation more generally, I note the findings of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland, which published their report in July 2015. Having considered the option of a tax credit that would be available to those who incur childcare costs, the Group recommended against introducing such a measure. The group had concerns that a tax credit would not be equitable, would have high possible deadweight, could end up being fully absorbed in the cost of childcare, and might not have a meaningful impact on a parent's decision on whether to join or to return to the labour market.  Estimates produced at the time also suggested that the annual Exchequer cost of such a measure could be very substantial. </p>  <p>  I have no plans, at present, to introduce a specific income tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs. As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints and the equitable treatment of all tax-payers. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. </p><p>Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year.

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing their coherent implementation across Government.</p>  <p>  The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets. </p>  <p>  The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Group specifically leads on two specific sub-actions under Sustainable Development Goals 9 and 12. These sub-actions relate to the delivery of resilient and sustainable infrastructure, and promoting of sustainable public procurement practices respectively. The following sections provide an update on the latest guiding policies and work programmes that are being progressed to meet the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals.  </p>  <p>  Sub-action under SDG goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</p>  <p>  Update on building resilient and sustainable infrastructure</p>  <p>  The current guiding policy is Project Ireland 2040, which consists of my Department&rsquo;s National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 &ndash; 2027 and the National Planning Framework as led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The current NDP sets out total investment of approximately &euro;116 billion across all sectors and this will allow Ireland to move close to the top of the international league table for public investment.</p>  <p>  Climate Action and Sustainability were core to the design of both the NDP and the National Planning Framework. Both policies address 10 key National Strategic Objectives, with one of the strategic outcomes identified being &ldquo;Transition to a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society&rdquo;. As a result, &euro;21.8 billion has been prioritised for investment in the low carbon transition, with a further &euro;8.6 billion allocated for investment in sustainable public transport. Specific investments identified include flagship investment programmes such as supports for energy efficiency and retro-fitting, to the delivery of major new public transport projects such as MetroLink and BusConnects. In addition, the &euro;500 million Climate Action Fund is also providing funding on a competitive basis for initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets or offer the potential for innovative interventions in these sectors. More generally the approach to sustainable compact growth that is set out in the National Planning Framework and the NDP will support a more balanced pattern of development across the country. This will put an end to the urban sprawl of the past and support greater sustainability and climate resilience.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, a review of the NDP is currently taking place. In line with the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, this review is focused on how Project Ireland 2040 can be further supported to deliver on the policy priorities in the Programme for Government, particularly climate action. The NDP Review is also focused on balanced regional growth and alignment with Ireland's spatial strategy of NPF. The Phase 1 report of the NDP review was published on April 4th 2021, and forms part of the evidence base for finalising the drafting of the revised NDP.  Phase 2 of the review will be a revised NDP setting ten year capital ceilings out to 2030 alongside five year rolling departmental capital ceilings and priorities and is planned to be published in Summer 2021.</p>  <p>  Sub-action under SDG goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</p>  <p>  Update on the promotion of sustainable public procurement practices</p>  <p>  Metrics are key to enable monitoring and verification of any measures introduced aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of public works projects.  In this regard the Office of Government Procurement is currently engaged with the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS) coalition in the development of an international reporting system for whole life carbon in the built environment.  The ICMS coalition anticipate that ICMS 3rd Edition, incorporating Life Cycle Analysis, will be available for public consultation by September 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work on developing standard metrics, consideration is also being given to the following:</p>  <p>  - The incorporation of Life Cycle Analysis into the design stage,</p>  <p>  - The availability of open source Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) to industry,</p>  <p>  - Development of award criteria for assessment of tenders incorporating Life Cycle Analysis,</p>  <p>  - Development of guidance for the incorporation and evaluation of Life Cycle Analysis in public procurement.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) published an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in late 2018. This note helps policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives, including environmental sustainability, as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement. This instructed departments to consider including green criteria in public procurement processes, where defined and measurable criteria exist. The OGP contributed to a revision of Green Procurement &ndash; Guidance for the Public Sector, led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which, in addition to broad guidance on Green Public Procurement (GPP), will describe defined, measurable, and up to date &lsquo;Irish GPP criteria&rsquo; for 10 priority sectors. This will greatly assist public bodies to include green criteria in their procurement, in line with Circular 20/2019. The OGP also assisted the EPA in developing training in this area aimed at procurement practitioners and is currently contributing to a steering committee set up by Eastern and Midlands Climate Action Regional Office to address the need for training in the use of GPP across the local authority sector.</p>  <p>  Circular 20/2019 also requires Departments to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles. A GPP monitoring and reporting template, capturing the frequency and value of green criteria in public procurements over &euro;25,000, was developed by the EPA, with input from the OGP. This will feature in the Annual Report of each government department from 2021. </p>  <p>  The OGP chairs a cross-departmental Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. This year, the OGP and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications together set up an Environmental subgroup of the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, to allow more detailed, technical, discussion of environmental considerations with experts including from the EPA and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. </p></reply>

All external walls are being repointed and grouted with heritage grout to reduce water penetration through the external fabric.  Works have been carried out to the roof to improve water runoff. Extensive work to lead detailing, valleys and wall walks in addition to the upgrade and replacement of gutters has also been undertaken to effect the good run-off of rainwater.   The weathering of chimneys especially on the West wall has been particularly difficult. </p>  <p>  Restrictions associated with the Covid 19 pandemic has disrupted the good progress of these works.  Currently, work to the North and West walls is complete and is approaching 50% on the South and East walls.    </p>  <p>  After all external works are complete, an upgrade of the electrical and heating systems is planned, the completion of which, will clear the way for a reopening to the public. Every effort is being made to expedite the works which can only be undertaken in sequence.  It is not possible at this time to give a precise date for reopening to the public.</p></reply>

Transposition of the Directive will require amendments to the 2014 Act.</p>  <p>  In this regard, on 12 May 2021, following approval from Government, I published the General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Protected Disclosures Act to give effect to the Directive.

In recognition of the improving epidemiological situation, the Government announced a roadmap on 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over May and June, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures are now being eased, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. Further detail is available on Gov.ie: </p><p>.</p><p>NPHET has advised that this phased plan for the months of May and June can be considered low to medium risk. However, they also advise that a faster reopening over these months would be very high risk. A number of higher-risk activities including outdoor mass gatherings and events (such as parkruns) are not part of the reopening plans for May and June, but they will be subject to further consideration towards the end of June with a view to recommencing these activities as we move through the summer. </p><p>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that there continues to be regular contact with parkrun organisers and detailed discussions regarding a return of parkrun events will commence once Government has taken decisions in relation to the re-introduction of outdoor mass participation events.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

In the meantime, the Arts Council has worked with my Department to develop guidance for children and young people&rsquo;s arts and cultural activities. The guidance was recently published on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website. </p><p>This guidance will continue to be updated in line with any relevant changes to public health measures in the coming months. This guidance was reviewed by my Department&rsquo;s external Health and Safety advisors to ensure compliance with:</p><p>- The Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead;</p><p>- The Government&rsquo;s Stay Safe Guidelines;</p><p>- The Government&rsquo;s Work Safely Protocols.</p><p>The guidelines will assist those engaging in arts and cultural activities with children to provide a safe and controlled environment which will mitigate against the risk of spreading COVID-19. This guidance is a living document, which means that as government restrictions and public-health guidelines evolve, this document will also evolve to reflect new government advice and changes to protocols as they emerge.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s Young People, Children and Education guidance may be used for organised cultural activities for children and young people, including early-childhood arts activities and arts training and education services that are delivered outside of early learning-and-care, formal education and youth-work contexts.</p><p>The Guidance is available the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Dance  classes are included with organised indoor and outdoor events.  The Path Ahead Framework sets out when it is considered that organised indoor or outdoor events can take place.Since 10 May 2021 organised outdoor gatherings with a maximum attendance of 15 people can take place. In all these cases robust protocols and protective measures, including appropriate supervision and capacity limits, should be in place.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  The government has decided to move ahead with this The Path Ahead plan. We are now in the early stages of the Recovery phase of the pandemic. The decision is based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), that a cautious and gradual phased reopening over May and June, with an emphasis on outdoor activity and a moderate increase in social contact, can be considered low to medium risk. NPHET has advised that there is scope to ease a range of public health measures in this manner with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This allows us to continue through the Recovery phase, focusing on what is safest and generates the most benefit and with a focus on outdoors activities &ndash; both social and economic.</p></reply>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing their coherent implementation across Government.</p><p>The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets. </p><p>The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at  </p><p>The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has responsibility for leading implementation of the following specific targets under SDGs 8, 11 and 12. </p><p>Target 8.9 - By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement, People, Place, and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025, affirms that it will place tourism as a key element of its economic strategy, with development in the tourism sector reflecting the highest standards of environment and economic sustainability.</p><p>It is anticipated that a new tourism policy will be developed, with an overall emphasis on sustainability, as we look to rebuild the tourism sector in a post-pandemic world. This policy commitment will seek to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be among the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices from not only an environmental but also a social and economic perspective. </p><p>Work on this new national tourism policy will commence when the tourism sector has stabilised following the pandemic. This policy will build upon the work undertaken by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group set up under the outgoing policy which has developed Guiding Principles for Sustainable Tourism Development in Ireland.</p><p>Target 11.4 Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world&rsquo;s cultural and natural heritage</p><p>Together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage which has primary responsibility for the protection and safeguarding of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, my Department has responsibility for safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage including our arts and culture, our sports and Gaeltacht communities. In that regard, in 2015 Ireland ratified the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. Since 2018, our unique practices of Hurling and Irish Harping have been recognised by UNESCO and added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. My Department has also developed a National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage where 30 practices have been inscribed. More information on the Inventory and practices can be found here . It is expected that further practices will be inscribed to the Inventory this year.</p><p>Target 12b - Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism which creates jobs, promotes local culture and products.</p><p>The Government's Tourism Policy Statement has been successfully implemented by way of two Tourism Action Plans, initially from 2016-2018 and latterly from 2019-2021. The implementation of the most recent Action Plan was interrupted by the need to respond to the devastating impact the COVID-19 crisis has wrought on the Irish tourism sector.</p><p>However, this Action Plan contained an action providing for the establishment of a working group to review international best practice in sustainable tourism and to propose guiding principles for sustainable tourism development in Ireland. A Sustainable Tourism Working Group including senior representatives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation was established under the aegis of the Tourism Leadership Group and chaired by the Department.  The group completed its work on this action in late 2019 and its report was subsequently published and is available at . The report set out the ambition that &ldquo;Ireland will seek to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices&rdquo; and it also set out accompanying Guiding Principles for Sustainable Tourism Development in Ireland.</p><p>The Sustainable Tourism Working Group reconvened this year to complete the development of a suite of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new policy being developed.</p><p>My Department's Statement of Strategy  2021-2023, which is now being finalised for submission to Government and subsequent publication, will reference my Department's responsibilities in relation to  the above mentioned sustainable development goal targets.</p></reply>

When such a planning application is subsequently made to a planning authority, under Section 34(8) of the Act, the planning authority must make a decision within eight weeks of receiving a valid application where no further information is requested from the applicant. A decision of a planning authority on a planning application may be appealed to An Bord Pleanala within 4 weeks of the decision.

The Committee recommended, amongst other things, that the cost of domestic consumption of water services be met from general taxation rather than by means of direct charges on households, with the exception of levies or disincentives necessary to curb wasteful and excessive use of water services.   These recommendations have been given statutory effect under the Water Services Act 2017. The current Programme for Government includes a commitment to the implementation of the recommendation of the Committee in relation to excess use. Arrangements necessary to give effect to this commitment, and thus conserve water supplies, are currently being advanced by my Department and by Irish Water.</p></reply>

This is up from 95% in 2019 and improvements in bathing water quality are welcome and necessary.  </p>  <p>  Currently in Ireland there are almost 150 designated bathing waters identified by local authorities with the help of public consultation.  Excellent work is being carried out by local authorities and other stakeholders on the continued improvements in our bathing water quality.  For both local and national tourism, it is important that the network of bathing waters is strengthened and enhanced.  For this reason I am particularly delighted to see two new bathing waters in Carrigaholt and Quilty identified in 2020. Credit must go to Clare County Council for their work in making this happen. It should be noted that responsibility for protecting and improving our waters rests with my Department rather than the Department of the Environment, Climate Action and Communications.</p>  <p>  The reduction in poor bathing waters from 5 to 4 is also welcomed but it is clear that work must continue. Local authorities and Irish Water are working closely together to ensure issues at these 4 poor bathing waters are remedied as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  These issues are often complex and require input from a variety of stakeholders to resolve, however recent successes at Ballyloughane and Portrane Beaches have demonstrated that once issues are identified and resolved, bathing water quality can improve rapidly.</p>  <p>  The continued poor status at Clifden is disappointing. However, Galway County Council has identified a new bathing area at nearby Aillebrack/Silverhill Beach and it will continue to work to ensure that Clifden can be reclassified as a bathing water.</p>  <p>  I would encourage all bathers to use the information on the dedicated www.beaches.ie website before going swimming, and to always follow the advice of the HSE and Department of Health in relation to social distancing protocols when you are at the beach. Following periods of heavy and sustained rainfall, specific and temporary bathing prohibition notices are issued where necessary, and as a precautionary measure for beaches, to protect people&rsquo;s health pending water test results.</p>  <p>  In regards to improving the standards of waste water discharge into the environment, our waste water networks require ongoing and sustained investment and the Government has approved the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 comprising of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.</p>  <p>  Last year the Dublin Task Force was created including representatives of my Department, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Irish Water to work together to diagnose the root-causes and put in place programmes to solve issues specific to Dublin Bay. </p>  <p>  I am also very aware of the recent increase in people swimming outdoors, and the increase of beach users generally, outside of the traditional bathing season so I have tasked the Bathing Water Expert Group with examining potential increases to the frequency of bathing water monitoring and improving the availability of results to improve information for people swimming outside of the designated bathing season.  I have also requested that the Expert Group consider the issues related to changing the bathing water season, taking into account the current review by the European Commission of the Bathing Water Directive.</p></reply>

These proposals will be fully considered by my Department and the Office of Public Works in determining the best solution for the national monument site.</p></reply>

However, it is too early to say what the overall impact will be. In respect of social housing, I have asked local authorities to engage with developers, contractors and their AHB delivery partners to take all possible measures to maximise delivery in 2021.</p></reply>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing their coherent implementation across Government.</p><p>The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. The Goals are mainstreamed in domestic policy and the governance structure reflects a whole-of-government approach and ensures coordination and coherence, in particular where goals cover areas of shared responsibility. </p><p>19 Actions were included in the first National Implementation Plan. Action 4 of the plan set out a commitment to include reference in all new Statements of Strategy to the SDG targets for which a Department has lead responsibility. </p><p>The development of the next SDG Implementation Plan has commenced, with the intention of publication later this year. A National Progress report will be incorporated into the Plan and will assess progress on the 19 Actions, including the commitment set out under Action 4. </p><p>My Department recently published its Statement of Strategy 2021-2025 and in addition to including relevant actions in the body of the document, it also provided a clear link to the SDG goals by making explicit reference to them in the context-setting section dedicated to the Department's Mission, Values and Goals.</p><p>The Statement of Strategy is available on the Department's website at https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9a047-statement-of-strategy-2021-2025/ </p><p>An important element of the first National Implementation Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets.</p><p>The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie.</p><p>My Department has responsibility for leading implementation on:</p><p>- SDG 6 'Clean Water and Sanitation' with input from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; </p><p>- SDG 14 &lsquo;Life Below Water&rsquo;, with input from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine  and the Department of Foreign Affairs;</p><p>- SDG 15 &lsquo;Life on Land&rsquo;, with input from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Progress on these Goals is provided in Table 1 attached.</p><p>My Department has input into SDG 1 &lsquo;No Poverty&rsquo; and SDG 11 &lsquo;Sustainable Cities and Communities&rsquo;, and SDG 17 &lsquo;Partnerships for the Goals&rsquo;; however does not lead on the implementation of these goals.</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-05-19_pq-379-380-19-05-2021_en.docx">Table</a></p></reply>

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr Denis McCarthy (formerly Waterford Co Co) and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Their Report (available on the Department&rsquo;s website) was published on 13 June 2017. It concluded that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite. </p>  <p>  In many of the affected dwellings, the problems appear to have been exacerbated by their location in geographic areas of severe exposure and the ingress of moisture into the concrete blocks. The problems were possibly accelerated by the extreme weather conditions arising in the winters of 2009 and 2010. </p>  <p>  The panel estimated that the scale of the problem in Donegal as being between 1,200 to 4,800 private dwellings and 541 to 1,000 social housing dwellings. In the case of Mayo, the panel estimates that the minimum potential number of private dwellings likely to be affected is approximately 345 and a total of 17 social housing units across 3 estates are known to be affected. </p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland published a standardised protocol in November 2018 - I.S. 465:2018 for the assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials. It establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials and:</p>  <p> - Describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem;</p>  <p> - Describes the scope of any testing required; and</p>  <p> - Categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p>  <p>  Rigorous analysis therefore has already been carried out in relation to the circumstances that led to the defective concrete block issue and the scheme was informed by the work of the Expert Panel and the current maximum grant amounts payable under the scheme were finalised in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process also took account of the comprehensive engagement that took place between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils, who operate and administer the scheme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage 378 stage one applications (308 in Donegal and 70 in Mayo) have been submitted and nearly 60% have been approved. The Scheme needs time to work and it is premature to consider making changes at this point. I am keeping progress of the scheme under review and engaging directly with both local authorities and local action groups on the matter.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent legal entities whose purchasing activities are governed by public procurment rules. It would not be appropriate therefore for my Department to comment on the individual purchasing decisions of local authorities.</p></reply>

Since 2013, over 73,500 units of local authority housing stock have been retrofitted under the programme with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161 million.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to retrofitting 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent (BER) standard by 2030, of which, approximately 36,500 are expected to be local authority owned homes. This requires local authorities to move to a 'deeper retrofit' programme, thus building on what has been completed in previous years. The revised programme provides for a significant increase in the level of funding available and focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. Works eligible under the Programme include attic/cavity wall insulation or external wall insulation where required, windows and doors replacement where required, heat pump installation and ancillary and associated works. </p>  <p>  All local authorities have received their full allocation under the newly revised 2021 programme. The budget for 2021 is &euro;45m and Donegal County Council has received an allocation of &euro;1,569,993 for the retrofit of a minimum 58 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal BER standard.</p></reply>

A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings, to which the local authorities are not party.</p><p>The tables attached reflect the number of homes delivered in each Local Authority area, under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility by year and the total associated CALF funding for these units, for 2018-2020, inclusive.</p><p>* Please note that these figures do not include PART V units.

The Act provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations set out the minimum legal performance requirements for the construction of new buildings and certain works to existing buildings. They do not prescribe materials or methods of construction to be used. The purpose of the Building Regulations is primarily to protect the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings. </p>  <p>  Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published for Parts A - M of the Second Schedule to the Building Regualtions. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant TGD, such works are considered to be, prima facie, in compliance with that Part of the Regulations. However, the adoption of an approach other than that outlined in the guidance is not precluded provided that the relevant requirements of the Regulations are complied with.</p>  <p>  Part D of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out</p>  <p>  - using &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo; which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used, and</p>  <p>  - in a workmanlike manner </p>  <p>  to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations. </p>  <p>  The process of Agr&eacute;ment certification applies to those products and processes which do not fall within the scope of existing construction standards, either because they are innovative or because they deviate from established norms. NSAI Agr&eacute;ment assesses, specifies testing, and where appropriate, issues Agr&eacute;ment certificates confirming that new building products, materials, techniques and equipment are safe and fit for purpose in accordance with the Irish Building Regulations and with the terms of the certificate. Such certificates may be in addition to, but not conflict with CE marking.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform convenes the Construction Sector Group (CSG). The CSG facilitates regular and open dialogue between Government and industry on topics such as productivity, environmental sustainability and skills/capacity and digital innovation. In this context, an Innovation and Digital Adoption Team to improve industry productivity across 7 actions has been established including Research and Modern Methods of Construction. My Department is engaging with these initiatives in the interests of improving efficiency, sustainability and value for money, while maintaining compliance with Building Regulations and other minimum quality standards.</p></reply>

The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord but does not capture further details of closed tenancies that transfer to other forms of social housing. The management of individual HAP tenancy exits is a matter for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Similarly, my Department does not gather specific detail on RAS tenancies moving to other forms of social housing. The management of individual RAS properties is a matter for each individual local authority, in accordance with the contractual arrangements entered into in respect of each property. Under RAS, local authorities retain the responsibility to source further accommodation for a RAS household should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable through no fault of their own.  </p>  <p>  Legislation provides that both HAP and RAS are considered to be forms of social housing support. Households in receipt of HAP and RAS are, therefore, not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP and RAS, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing through a transfer list. </p>  <p>  RAS and HAP continue to be effective and secure forms of social housing support, and remain a significant part of the suite of social housing options currently available to those who are assessed as being in need of housing support.</p></reply>

Following assessment by the EAG of each property's potential to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value, and the presence of robust local stakeholder support for the project, it will formulate its recommendations to me as the Minister of State with responsibility for Heritage on the future composition of Ireland's Tentative List. </p></reply>

Its approach to &lsquo;External Validation&rsquo; &ndash; meeting and reviewing each of our 27 fire services and reporting on their status - is both timely and reassuring. The most recent exercise in 2020 to review the impact of Covid on fire services was undertaken at a difficult time and was particularly welcome.</p><p>The NDFEM&rsquo;s Management Board also leads the community fire safety approach which has been so successful in driving down our fire fatality rates. Ireland is in the league of most fire safe countries with a typical rate of approximately four fire fatalities per million of population, a third of what it was a decade ago.</p><p>In the years cited in the attached question, the Management Board has had a membership of 13 persons, made up as follows:</p><p>-  An Independent Chairperson </p><p>-  The head of the relevant division within my Department</p><p>-  The National Director of Fire and Emergency Management in my Department</p><p>-  A representative of the Chief Fire Officers (CFOs) Association</p><p>-  Representatives from the City and County Management Association</p><p>-  An international expert</p><p>- A representative from the Department of Defence</p><p>- A representative from Insurance Ireland</p><p>The Chairperson is the only member of the Management Board who is paid a fee by the Department. This fee, set out in the Table below, is the national rate for chairing of Category IV Boards. Also reflected in the Table are expenses recouped to the Chief Fire Officer representative and International Expert in connection with their attendance at Board meetings. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chair</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fee</td>       <td>&euro;9,450</td>       <td>&euro;9,450</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>International Expert</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Expenses</td>       <td>&euro;369.76</td>       <td>&euro;92.44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CFOs Association Representative</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Expenses</td>       <td>&euro;1,142.09*</td>       <td>&euro;158.74</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It should be noted that the International expert, who is a member of the Board, carries out a range of work for the NDFEM, leading significant projects including the C Tr&iacute; Fire Services Mobilisation and Communications Project and ensuring appropriate linkage across NDFEM work in the Information and Communication Technology, fire service operations and fire safety areas. In 2020, he was commissioned to lead the Management Board's external validation/ quality assurance process into the impact of Covid on fire services. This study was undertaken over the summer of 2020 was reported upon in the 'Response, Resilience and Recovery' Report published in October 2020. The amounts paid by my Department to the international expert for this work in the period 2019 was &euro;52,340.55 and in 2020 was &euro;64,470.82. Also, in addition to expenses listed in the table above for attending Board meetings of the NDFEM, the Chief Fire Officer representative attended a range of other NDFEM meetings and was recouped &euro;3,888.35*  in 2019 and &euro;569.99 in 2020 for attending those meetings.</p><p>*This total also includes expenses incurred 2018 but paid in 2019.</p></reply>

Resumption of nominations remains under review in the light of evolving public health considerations, particularly, as regards international travel, and will not include either the Armenian or Moldovan calls received this month. </p>  <p>  Since February 2020 the EU sought nominations from the Department in respect of four election observation missions. The  Department nominated 1 LTO (long term observer) and 4 STOs (short term observers) for an EU election observation mission in Bolivia scheduled for May 2020 and nominated 3 LTOs and 3 STOs for an EU election observation mission in Sri Lanka scheduled for April 2020. However, in March 2020 the EU High representative/Vice President suspended the deployment of both these EU EOMs in line with the EU&rsquo;s efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Due to the challenges posed by the public health pandemic the EU did not issue any further calls until September 2020. Between September 2020 and April 2021, the EU issued a call for long-term observers for two election observation missions &ndash; one for elections that took place in Ghana in December 2020 and one for proposed Parliamentary and Representative Council elections planned to take place in Ethiopia in June 2021.  In both instances, calls were not made for short-term observers. Instead, to mitigate COVID risks,  the EU focused on sourcing short-term observers locally through diplomatic channels, involving either diplomatic staff (as is often the norm) or volunteers identified with the support of diplomatic channels. The election observation mission to Ethiopia has since been cancelled as agreement on key parameters for the deployment of the mission could not be reached with Ethiopian authorities.</p>  <p>  In February 2020, 1 long-term observer and 2 short-term observers for an OSCE election observation mission to Azerbaijan, were deployed from the Irish roster. Since then the OSCE sought nominations from the Department in respect of 16 election observation missions. Three calls for observers to North Macedonia, Poland and Serbia were issued in February 2020. However, in March 2020 the OSCE cancelled election observation missions to North Macedonia and Serbia due to COVID-19. Between July 2020 and March 2021 the calls for 11 election observation missions were conducted as Limited Election Observation Missions (LEOM), without deployment of short-term observers. This included election observation missions to the USA, Montenegro, Kyrgyzstan (Parliamentary elections), Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova (Presidential elections), Romania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan (Presidential elections), Bulgaria and Albania. Two of these (Georgia and Albania) were initially sent as both calls for long-term observers and short-term observers and the call for short-term observers was cancelled when the mission was scaled back to LEOMs due to COVID-19. Five of these (USA, Montenegro, Kyrgyzstan (Parliamentary elections), Moldova and Romania) were initially sent as calls for long-term observers with the intention of issuing a call for short-term observers, and then scaled back to LEOMs due to COVID-19. In May 2021, the OSCE issued two further calls for observers for election observation missions for Parliamentary elections in Moldova and Armenia.  As outlined in previous replies it is not the practice to nominate missions for non-developing countries (as per OECD-DAC criteria) which would include the USA, Bulgaria and Romania. </p></reply>

I also condemn rocket fire from Gaza which has killed Israeli civilians, including children. </p>  <p>  The protection of all civilians, in Gaza, in the West Bank and in Israel, is of paramount importance and is an obligation under international humanitarian law. The high number of Palestinian civilians killed - a quarter of them children- is simply unacceptable. The impact of Israeli strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip is disproportionate, and the impact on children, in an already difficult humanitarian situation, is especially worrying. Israel must abide by the provisions of International Humanitarian Law, particularly in relation to the Protection of Civilians, including when exercising the right to self-defence. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic engagement with Israel is important as it is a means for us to directly communicate our concerns around actions such as those we have witnessed in the past week. On 11 May, I called in the Israeli Ambassador and underlined that Israel&rsquo;s actions in Gaza which are causing significant civilian casualties are unacceptable and Israel must act responsibly and comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law. These messages matter, and by expelling an Ambassador, we would be closing down our channel of communication with the Israeli Government. </p>  <p>  On 16 May, I addressed an emergency open session of the UN Security Council. I called strongly for a cessation of hostilities and emphasised the obligations that all sides have under international humanitarian law. I called on the Council to send a clear and united message that this cycle of violence and bloodshed must end now. </p>  <p>  The President of the General Assembly of the United Nations has convened a meeting on the situation on 20 May. </p>  <p>  I will continue to press this issue at the UN and through the EU. On 18 May I will join an extraordinary meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel and will raise Ireland's concerns in clear terms and urge a strong EU response. </p></reply>

Ireland will present its next Voluntary National Review in 2022. This will outline Ireland&rsquo;s progress on SDG achievement since our first Voluntary National Review presented to the HLPF in July 2018. In addition, the Department's annual report and the Irish Aid annual report, while not SDG reporting instruments, also relate elements of the Department's contribution towards reaching its SDG targets.</p></reply>

The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p>  <p>  As the Stormont House Agreement framework does, there is a need to take a comprehensive view of how to achieve progress and reconciliation for society as a whole, but the needs of victims and families cannot be sidelined. They need to be at the heart of the process. </p>  <p>  The Government has engaged regularly on legacy issues with the British Government, including since the UK Written Ministerial Statement on Legacy of March 2020. In every engagement, we have urged them to progress the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement framework. When I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland earlier this month, I strongly advised against any unilateral action on these sensitive issues.  </p>  <p>  We have made clear that we are ready to engage and work with the British Government and the parties in relation to any concerns around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, but have made equally clear at every point that this must be a collective process.</p></reply>

Mr. Lukashenko has sought to legalise the severe repression of his regime, which has produced a chilling effect on dissent within the country. Impunity breeds violence and we have been clear in publicly calling for that impunity to end. We continue to work with our international partners to address the situation in Belarus and play an active role in formulating EU policy and responses. </p>  <p>  The Belarusian Ambassador resident in London has not at this time been accredited to Ireland and my Department has had no interactions with him.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus. We regret that the authorities continue to deny her access to the country in her official capacity. It is imperative that human rights violations are transparently and independently investigated. To that end, Ireland played a constructive role in the successful EU-led resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that enhanced the mandate of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate over 2,000 reported violations. </p>  <p>  We also support other investigative mechanisms such as the International Accountability Platform for Belarus and international criminal investigations under the concept of Universal Jurisdiction. Those responsible for violations and abuses must be brought to justice. </p>  <p>  Sanctions are another method through which the international community can bring accountability. The EU is currently readying further restrictive measures against those responsible for implementing and enabling the regime's repression. Ireland fully supports the imposition of a fresh round of sanctions. Pressure must be maintained on the authorities to adhere to their international obligations and commitments.</p>  <p>  Our support for the Belarusian people is unwavering and we will continue to do what we can to ensure their human rights and fundamental freedoms are protected. </p></reply>

international security policy; disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control; and sustainable development.  The Defence Organisation will support the &ldquo;Global Ireland 2025&rdquo; ambitions to expand and grow the contribution Ireland makes abroad.  The Defence Organisation will continue to contribute to the implementation of the relevant sustainable development goals and targets, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p></reply>

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process.</p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms, including the replacement and refurbishment of Naval Service vessels. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result of the White Paper commitment to Naval Service vessel replacement, the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the immediate White Paper project in this context. The MRV project is an important developmental project and indicative of the commitment to on-going investment and development of defence capabilities. It is a major project and work remains on-going in progressing it. This project is at currently underway and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV, subject to availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall EDP process.</p></reply>

On a voluntary basis, 25 EU Member States have joined PESCO and subscribed to more binding commitments to invest, plan, develop and operate defence capabilities together within this EU framework.</p>  <p>  Ireland's participation in PESCO was agreed by Government and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann prior to the Council Decision establishing PESCO on 11 December 2017.</p>  <p>  The objective of PESCO is to generate coherent defence capabilities which will be available to Member States for national and multinational peacekeeping and crisis management missions and operations under UN, EU or NATO leadership. This will enhance the EU&rsquo;s capacity as an international security actor, to contribute to the protection of EU citizens, support international peace and security and maximise the effectiveness of defence spending by participating member States.</p>  <p>  As part of PESCO participation, Member States have agreed to fulfil commitments which include; regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, increased cooperation on cyber defence, cooperating on capability development and participating in at least one project under PESCO. Member States have also agreed to produce a National Implementation Plan, updated annually, to assist in the assessment of Member States' fulfilment of the PESCO commitments both collectively and on an individual basis. The most recent National Implementation Plan submission, Ireland&rsquo;s third, was made in March of this year.</p>  <p>  The commitments made under PESCO, and which are assessed in the National Implementation Plan, support the overall development of Defence Forces capabilities in support of peacekeeping and crisis management operations through cooperation and participation in joint projects, with like-minded partners. </p>  <p>  Ireland engaged fully with the PESCO Strategic Review (PSR) process which took place last year, bringing to a close the first initial phase of PESCO (2018-2020). A Strategic Review of Permanent Structured Cooperation was required as per the 2017 Council Decision which established PESCO. Its purpose was to assess what had been achieved so far and to consider updating and enhancing the more binding commitments and related more precise objectives in order to reflect the Union&rsquo;s evolving security environment. Following extensive discussions, Council Conclusions on the Strategic Review were finalised in November of 2020.</p>  <p>  Forty seven PESCO projects have been launched to-date. These include projects in the areas of capability development and in the operational domain. Each project is managed by the participating member States with oversight from the Council.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a participant in one PESCO project (Greek led &lsquo;Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance&rsquo;) and also has observer status on the following nine PESCO projects (1) Deployable Military Disaster Relief Capability Package; (2) Maritime (semi) Autonomous Systems for Mine Countermeasures; (3)Cyber Threats and Incident Response Information Sharing Platform; (4) European Secure Software Defined Radio; (5) Military Mobility; (6) Energy Operational Function; (7) EU Radio Navigation Solution; (8) Counter Unmanned Aerial System; (9) Special Operations Forces Medical Training Centre. </p>  <p>  The activities around these projects include attendance and reporting of meetings and workshops.</p>  <p>  Ireland also participated in the German led project EU Training Mission Competence Centre, this project closed in November 2019 with the agreement of all members as it duplicated existing structures in the EU.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces are currently reviewing our involvement in PESCO projects and exploring the possibility of participating in projects which bring value from a Defence Forces capability development perspective.  Work on the 4th tranche of PESCO projects is also commencing through the PESCO Secretariat in the European Defence Agency.  This involves Member States proposing a set of new PESCO projects.  Any new projects will be subject to approval of the Council later this year.  These new project proposals will be analysed in relation to Defence Forces current and future capability development.  </p>  <p>  As a matter of policy under the current Programme for Government, participation in further PESCO projects by Ireland will be subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval. </p></reply>

Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. </p>  <p>  I also note Section 30.2 (e) of the Education Act 1998 provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of instruction in any subject contrary to their conscience if they so wish.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop an inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships. In this regard, the NCCA have recently published learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum on their online toolkit which supports teaching and learning linked to the current curriculum; and work on developing a new Junior Cycle curriculum begins in September. Should any legislative changes be required I am committed to making such changes, as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

In order to be entered on the Register of Teachers, and depending on the route of registration, all registrants are required to hold, or attain within 3 years,  an accredited initial teacher education qualification.  Where a teachers holds qualifications in special education in addition to a teacher education qualification, such qualifications may be added to teachers record.  Teachers who hold recognised Special Education Teaching qualifications obtained outside the State may continue  to apply for registration with the Council under Route 4 and there is no intention to close-off this provision. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council as the professional standards body for the teaching profession, sets the standards for programmes of Initial Teacher Education.

The standards for programmes of ITE have recently been revised and were published in C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education (2020) in October 2020.

This Strategy is designed to provide a developmental framework to address those key challenges, including new and emerging issues. A key focus in this Strategy is considering how youth justice policy might be more closely aligned to other child and youth polices, and to promotion of community and local development. A key priority is prevention and early intervention.</p>  <p>  The Strategy emphasises evidence-informed development of programmes and interventions. Implementation of the Strategy will prioritise enhancement of existing services such as Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and developing a range of more specialised interventions with a particular focus on harder-to-reach children and young people. Officials in my Department will continue to work closely with officials in the Department of Justice as the strategy is implemented. </p></reply>

The Riversdale site is in the ownership of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDETB), who is also patron of the school referred to by the Deputy.  DDLETB,  with the agreement of the Department, has appointed a Design Team to oversee the works required to the Riversdale building to facilitate the school's occupancy of a section of the building. This project is phase one of a two phase development and the accommodation being provided during phase one includes classrooms, quiet rooms, central activity area, toilet accommodation and other ancillary spaces as well as outdoor play and sensory areas. The planning work associated with phase two will commence shortly and will include an extension to provide additional accommodation to facilitate the school&rsquo;s future growth. </p>  <p>  Relocating the school referred to by the Deputy to the Riversdale site is consistent with the Public Spending Code in the context of maximising value for money which also includes maximising the use of State assets. This is also consistent with the use of shared educational campuses being the preferred model for future development of educational infrastructure where feasible.  </p></reply>

National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2016-2020  (SDG 4.5) </p><p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) which is under the remit of the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth  provides the framework and strategic direction for interventions across Government Departments to support the additional needs of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  The Department of Education participate in the NTRIS Steering Group and the Education sub-group which oversees the implementation of the education actions of NTRIS. </p><p>Actions under way include work by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment following on from their audit of traveller culture and history in the curriculum, research on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s anti-bullying strategy for Traveller pupils, and a NTRIS pilot project in 4 areas aimed at improving Traveller and ROMA  attendance, participation and engagement in schools. It is intended that the outcomes of this pilot project will help to inform future policy. </p><p>4. Literacy and Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy (SDG 4.6)</p><p>The National Strategy: Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy for Learning and life 2011-2020 and Interim Review 2017 identified actions across six Pillars of the education system</p><p>- Pillar 1:  Enabling parents and communities to support children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy development </p><p>- Pillar 2:  Improving teachers&rsquo; and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE ) practitioners' professional practice</p><p>- Pillar 3:  Building the capacity of school leadership </p><p>- Pillar 4:  Improving the curriculum and the learning experience </p><p>- Pillar 5:  Helping students with additional learning needs to achieve their potential </p><p>- Pillar 6:  Improving assessment and evaluation to support better learning in literacy and numeracy. </p><p>The Strategy and Interim report sets a central policy context for connecting children, young people and adults in literacy and numeracy discussions. They address the need to target, coordinate and strengthen links between home and education settings, and to develop and promote models of good practice to support literacy and numeracy acquisition. They recognise the need for a cohesive and coordinated national approach.  </p><p>The priorities under the Strategy are linked to actions for related policy developments including the Further Education and Training Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2019.</p><p>New targets were set in the Interim Review 2017 including a set of discrete targets identified for DEIS schools after findings from studies such as the National Assessments of Mathematics and English Reading (NAMER) 2014 and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 highlighted the progress made in reading and mathematics with many of the targets set in the Strategy in 2011, having been met in just over half of the Strategy&rsquo;s lifetime.</p><p>Actions identified relate to reforms in initial teacher education, dedicated support for school leaders&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; professional learning and curriculum reform. Work outside the school sector by agencies like SOLAS, by ETBs, libraries and by organisations such as Aontas and NALA, is enabling adults to gain the competence to enhance their own literacy and numeracy skills and thereby to assist them to confidently work with their children and grandchildren.  </p><p>Development of a new Literacy and Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy, as set out in the Programme for Government, is underway.  The strategy will be informed by robust research to include consideration of national and international practice, by stakeholder engagement and public consultation. </p><p>5. STEM Education Policy Statement 2017-2026 (SDG 4.5)</p><p>The STEM Education Policy Statement 2017-2026 acknowledges that there is a need to increase the uptake of STEM subjects and to enhance STEM learning for learners of all backgrounds, abilities and gender, with a particular focus on uptake by females. Building on this, a Gender Balance in STEM Advisory group was established to guide national actions that will ensure STEM education in Ireland is world class in improving gender balance and inclusion effectively for our young people.  The Gender Balance in STEM Advisory group commissioned a Literature Review on Gender Balance in STEM, which was published in November 2020, entitled A Review of Literature to Identify a Set of Effective Interventions for Addressing Gender Balance in STEM in Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary Education Settings.</p><p>The report sets out what is known about critical barriers to girls&rsquo; participation in STEM education and STEM learning, while also highlighting effective interventions to increase participation of girls in STEM.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.</p><p>The frontloading of SNAs for mainstream classes is a key part of the School Inclusion Model.  The Department and NCSE are committed to its introduction as part of the development of that Model.</p><p>The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents. These sessions will now be rescheduled to take place during the 2021/22 school year. Further information will be issued by the NCSE in due course.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion and the Minister of State for Education have agreed on the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically roll over into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i></i></p><p>The NCSE will publish SNA allocations on their website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>by the end of May 2021.</p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 and Circular 0030/2020 are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

My Department recognises that we are likely to see a variety of responses amongst students ranging from excitement and happiness to worry and anxiety, which are normal responses to unprecedented events. Normalising feelings by communicating that we have all struggled with aspects of the latest school closure and school reopening, will help to create a safe environment for students. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is very mindful not to pathologise worry and anxiety related to Covid 19. Some students may experience short-term anxiety related to COVID 19 and some students may have longer term mental health issues which may be impacted by school closure and Covid 19. The response to support the well-being of all within school communities during the pandemic required a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  NEPS has issued guidance to schools to assist those who might be anxious and materials are available on the gov.ie website site. NEPS continues to deliver a psychological service to schools within the context of public health advice. </p>  <p>  There are a number of ways in which students well-being is supported in schools. A Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. </p>  <p>  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020/21 is 852.  </p>  <p>  Those with longer term mental health issues which may be impacted by school closure and Covid 19 will require ongoing specialist clinical support/ intervention.  The Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  Work will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. </p></reply>

The collection and gathering of information for each of topics may involve gathering data outside the school setting vis-&agrave;-vis a field study, surveys, questionnaires etc. Alternatively, data may be collected using primary and secondary data available from journals, databases, government departments, published reports etc. The extended completion date for 2021 Leaving Certificate Geography course work was 23 April 2021. </p>  <p>  For other year groups that may involve school trips, particularly for those students in TY, the Department has advised of the importance of the opportunity for strengthening peer relationships and connections. Bonding activities are an important part of the TY programme, provided they adhere to health and social distancing guidelines. In this context, outdoor activities merit consideration, within the public health guidelines.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. </p><p>New school designs built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Guidance have: </p><p>- A3 BER standard since 2009</p><p>- 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations</p><p>- 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics</p><p>- Infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging </p><p>- A3 BER is achieved using a hybrid approach of:</p><p>- Maximising nature through passive solar design, quality daylighting and quality ventilation.</p><p>- Enhanced technologies including LED lighting and controls with daylight and absence detection, digital individual room heating controls, maximum water efficiency and rain water harvesting systems, high quality air tightness and photovoltaic panels to produce an electrical renewable energy. </p><p>- Schools also have a system that automatically shuts down power to nonessential electrical power outlets when a school is closed (eliminating energy use out of hours). </p><p>- In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables is maximised in school design, whilst ensuring that renewable applications are properly suited to needs and reflective of school opening hours and school holiday periods. It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications. </p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s approach is based on future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a just transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents to include: </p><p>- Direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems, in series at a base level, with controls. </p><p>- Optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, (note further enhancement of the external building fabric will result in overheating in Spring and Autumn, requiring air conditioning). </p><p>- Low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems.  </p><p>- Provision of space in new primary school classroom layouts for mechanical ventilation heat recovery units.</p><p>- Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable heat to schools using biomass boilers, while allowing provision for the ESCO to provide, operate and maintain the boiler plant system.  </p><p>The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. </p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 from 2023 onwards, as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.</p><p>Now in its fifth year, the pilot programme has retrofitted 39 schools across Ireland to date. This year will see six schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school underwent a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures were suitable for that school and would deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme. The schools for the 2021 programme are:</p><p>- Col&aacute;iste I&oacute;saef Community College, Kilmallock, Co. Limerick</p><p>- Cornafulla National School, Athlone, Co. Roscommon</p><p>- St. Laserian&rsquo;s Special School, Carlow, Co. Carlow</p><p>- St. Mary&rsquo;s Boys National School, Monaghan, Co. Monaghan</p><p>- St. Columba&rsquo;s Comprehensive School, Glenties, Co. Donegal</p><p>- Maryfield College, Grace Park, Dublin 9</p><p>Design teams have been appointed to each school, with deep energy efficiency works to commence in summer 2021. The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 50% emissions reduction. The works will involve upgrades to doors and windows, insulation, lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan will outline how energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions targets are to be achieved.  This is due to be published in mid-2021 </p><p>As part of our continued research my Department is undertaking a further review of current school design principles based on the new focus of moving from energy demand reduction to energy related greenhouse gas emission reduction for the public sector bodies. </p><p>The Department recognises that transition to full decarbonisation raises the bar even higher in terms of requirements with feedback from our pathfinder projects as noted above indicating a greater depth of challenges at a significantly enhanced cost for primary and post primary schools. </p><p>This review includes decarbonisation options for new schools, the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building, review of energy gap between the predicted design energy operational performance and actual operational performance and establishing trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings.</p><p>This work will inform the Department&rsquo;s overall approach to achieve climate action targets. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Design Guidelines for all new schools provides for the provision of outdoor multi use games areas (hard play areas) and the level of play space provided varies with the size and location of the school site.  The logic underpinning the inclusion of outdoor hard play areas within the Department&rsquo;s design guidance is to provide a play/sport facility for ongoing and intensive use by schools on a continual year round basis. </p><p>Safe and active travel to school is being strongly supported by my Department.  On the 18<sup>th</sup>March 2021 my Department in conjunction with the Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan TD launched a new initiative called Safe Routes to School.  This will support active travel infrastructure for selected schools around the country. The programme, which is the next phase in the Government&rsquo;s investment in active travel, will see funding provided from the &euro;1.8 billion committed under the Programme for Government, to support walking/scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools.</p><p>The Safe Routes to School programme aims to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities, alleviate congestion at the school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing walking and cycling facilities. The improvements to the school commute could range from an upgraded footpath or new cycle lane to a complete reworking of a school&rsquo;s entrance.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support for the 2020/21 school year and it is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here </p><p>In relation to transport arrangements for the pupil referred to by the Deputy, my Department is currently liaising with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the family in this regard. </p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.</p><p>The frontloading of SNAs for mainstream classes is a key part of the School Inclusion Model.  The Department and NCSE are committed to its introduction as part of the development of that Model.</p><p>The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents.

Further information will be issued by the NCSE in due course.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion and the Minister of State for Education have agreed on the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year:</p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically roll-over into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year. In particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.

The allocation is used primarily to fund the salaries of teaching and non-teaching school staff, the development of school infrastructure, capitation funding for the ongoing running costs of schools, the payment of pensions to retired school staff, the costs associated with the school transport scheme and the general administration costs of my Department. </p>  <p>  Funding is also provided to enable the Department to make grant payments to Education and Training Boards to meet costs associated with the provision of certain educational services and to the various agencies and bodies that come under the aegis of my Department. Funding is also allocated for a range of programmes and initiatives.</p>  <p>  The annual Appropriation Account and Revised Estimates for Public Services for my Department's Vote provides detailed information regarding expenditure and receipts.   </p>  <p>  In the course of its work, my Department makes a significant number of payments every year. Such payments are made to individuals and organisations both by way of grants and also for the provision of goods and services to it. Some of the recipients of this funding may be non-governmental organisations and/or have charitable status although my Department&rsquo;s funding programmes are not generally directly aimed at such organisations.  However, as those labels are not necessarily assigned to payees and as my Department would be reliant on the relevant information being correctly notified by the organisations concerned, it is not possible to provide an accurate and complete list of such recipients. In those circumstances and in view of the fact that the Deputy has sought information covering a span of some twenty years, it would not be possible without utilising very significant staff resources to search for, identify and retrieve the information sought by him. </p>  <p>  If, however, the Deputy wishes to provide me with the names of specific non-governmental organisations or organisations with charitable status I will arrange to have the level of funding, if any, paid to them by my Department ascertained and provided to him.</p></reply>

The Goals are mainstreamed in domestic policy and the governance structure reflects a whole-of-government approach. 19 Actions were included in the first National Implementation Plan. </p><p>The development of the next SDG Implementation Plan has commenced, with the intention of publication later this year. A National Progress report will be incorporated into the Plan and will assess the progress on the 19 Actions. </p><p>Action 4 of the plan set out a commitment to include reference in all new Statements of Strategy to the SDG targets for which a Department has responsibility.  My Department has lead responsibility on three SDGs and co-leads on two more.  The Department is fully committed to supporting the implementation of these SDGs and the Department's  Statement of Strategy 2020-2023 reflects this commitment.  The Department's commitment to SDGs focuses on the areas of poverty and social inclusion - specifically enhanced social welfare for the poor and vulnerable, and an emphasis on improving youth unemployment. </p><p>The Statement of Strategy  outlines our high level objectives in this regard:</p><p>- Delivery of goals set out in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion &ndash; including reduction in poverty rates and improvement in living standards.</p><p>- Focusing improvements in welfare supports for children and young families, lone parent families and people with a disability as well as supporting people into work will be prioritised as a means of reducing and alleviating poverty and inequality.</p><p>With regard to youth unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted significantly on the economy and unemployment rates.  Prior to the pandemic, seasonally adjusted youth unemployment (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12% in December 2019.  Latest estimates, including all those in receipt of the PUP, gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 61.8% for young people at the end of April.  The inclusion of recipients of PUP brings students into the COVID-19 Adjusted Measure of youth unemployment and therefore inflates this measure.</p><p>As Minister for Social Protection, I welcomed the Council of the European Union&rsquo;s recommendation of a reinforced Youth Guarantee. Central to the reinforced programme is the extension of the widening of the youth age bracket to include young people aged 25-29. As part of activation services provided by the Department of Social Protection via Intreo, young people under 25 receive the most intensive engagement. My Department intend to extend this up to age 29, and are currently putting in place the necessary system changes for this to occur.</p><p>Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place a number of measures to support people back to employment:</p><p>- Increasing the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people, by expanding the young person rate from under 25 to under 30 years of age</p><p>- Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed. </p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2020-2023 is available at the following link. </p><p>https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/05b877-strategy-statements/ </p><p>Specific references to UN SDGs  are at page 8 of the Statement of Strategy. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) has responsibility for promoting the SDGs, and for overseeing coherent implementation across Government.</p>  <p>  The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets. </p>  <p>  The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs  and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Under the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020, the Department of Social Protection was given lead and stakeholder responsibility for several targets, focusing on the areas of social protection, poverty and inequality, and employment activation.</p>  <p>  Social transfers have an important role in reducing poverty and inequality. In this area, my Department has lead or stakeholder responsibility for Sustainable Development Goal targets 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 10.1 and 10.4. Budgets 2018 through 2021 have all been progressive, with a strong emphasis on supporting the most vulnerable. This includes a &euro;10 cumulative increase in weekly social welfare rates; a &euro;30 cumulative increase to the Working Family Payment for families of up to three children; the introduction of a upper qualified child rate for children aged 12 and over, and increasing this rate from &euro;29.80 for all children to &euro;38 for children under 12 and &euro;45 for children aged 12 and over; and a 100% Christmas Bonus since December 2018. Progress in this area is also being delivered through implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, for which I chair the steering group, among other Government strategies.</p>  <p>  Currently, my Department also has lead or stakeholder responsibility for targets 4.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.b, which focus on training and labour market activation. While employment has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, Government will shortly publish Pathways to Work 2021-2025. This strategy will be the next iteration of Government's national employment services strategy and will also be the successor to the Action Plan for Jobless Households.</p>  <p>  My Department also contributes to target 5.4 through supporting carers. In Budget 2020, the number of hours that a carer can work or study every week outside the home and still get Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Carer&rsquo;s Allowance increased from 15 hours to 18.5 hours. This was further supported by an announcement in Budget 2021 that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant will increase by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850 per year from June 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department&rsquo;s provision of the Fuel Allowance supports the delivery of target 7.1. Since the beginning of April 2018, the Fuel Allowance season has been extended by two weeks and the weekly rate has increased from &euro;22.50 to &euro;28. These measures, combined with other targeted budgetary measures listed above, ensure that low income households are not regressively impacted by increases in carbon tax. Research by the ESRI in October 2020 confirms that interventions of this nature will reverse the regressive impact of the carbon tax and will actually lead to a reduction in overall poverty, particularly child poverty.</p>  <p>  My Department has been actively engaged in both the Senior Officials Group and Interdepartmental Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals, and will continue to play an important role in Ireland achieving its SDG targets by 2030. </p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The current extension date is up to the 2nd   July 2021.   Over 7,000 CE and T&uacute;s participants are benefitting from this extension of  contract, that applies to all participants whose contracts were due to finish since end-October 2020. This extension date is under active review, in line with the gradual opening up of the economy and the recommencement of more normal service levels across more CE schemes over the coming months, as the vaccine continues to be rolled out. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that when CE participants are eventually due to finish on their respective schemes, this will be undertaken on a coordinated, phased basis over a number of months. This will provide further opportunities for the completion of training and additional work experience for CE participants.   </p>  <p>  With the gradual opening up of the economy , the scaling up of the Department's activation services and the resumption of more normal level of services across more CE schemes, increasing referrals to fill vacancies on CE schemes is a priority for my Department.  </p>  <p>  In addition, CE sponsoring authorities are encouraged by the Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE in their local communities.  They can advertise their vacancies on www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for job candidates and employers, including CE sponsors.  Jobseekers are advised to register their interest through this website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre who will determine their eligibility for the CE scheme.  The facility to register interest in CE schemes was introduced on the website in August 2020 in response to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants, including participants whose participation has been affected by COVID. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to classify a person as either a short-time, part-time or casual work employee, each case is examined on its merits having regard to the person&rsquo;s employment history, any fluctuation in the number of days worked, the systematic pattern of the work days, the existence of a contract of employment and if the employee is in receipt of a set wage.   </p>  <p>  In this case, the customer is considered a part-time worker. He is not categorised as a short-time worker as the number of days worked is not systematic i.e. there is no clear repetitive pattern of employment, nor is he categorised as a casual worker given his circumstances including that he  has assurance of repeat employment from the same employer.

Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion. The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p>  <p>  I have noted the recommendations made by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in relation to carers and, in particular, those pertinent to my Department regarding changes to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test and the 18.5 hour ceiling, respite and pension provision for family carers.</p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities. This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need. The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring. This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and is being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week. As per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021. For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%. For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  </p>  <p>  Increases to the disregard would result in the provision of additional payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to provide income supports to lower income households. Those existing carers whose sole income is the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would not benefit. An increase in the disregard would benefit just 3% of carers and benefit better-off families.</p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care. The person being cared for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months. However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  The maximum period in which a person may engage in employment, education and training is 18.5 hours per week and during this time, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2020, the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training was increased from 15 to 18.5 hours per week. This measure was prioritised in response to carers and carer representative groups who found the previous number of 15 hours to be too restrictive, not only for work but for education and training purposes. I consider the limit of 18.5 hours to represent a reasonable balance between meeting the care recipient's requirement for full-time care and the carer's need to maintain contact with the workforce.  </p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for providing respite care facilities and services rests with the Health Service Executive. In recognition of the vital role that carers provide in our society, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 as part of Budget 2021, to take effect this June. Spending on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is estimated to cost over &euro;265 million in 2021. This is a payment for carers throughout the State, not just to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and is available to other carers who may not be dependent on State income supports. The new rate of &euro;1,850 is the highest ever rate at which it will have been paid since its introduction.</p>  <p>  In relation to pension provision, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Pensions. The Commission&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependents can be accommodated within the State pension system. The Commission has been asked to submit a report on its work, findings, options and recommendations. I look forward to receiving this report by 30 June 2021. The Government intends to take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within six months of its report.  </p>  <p>  Currently, the State pension system gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role, through the award of credits and either the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (as part of the Yearly Average rate calculation method) or HomeCaring Periods (as part of the Interim TCA rate calculation method).</p>  <p>  Furthermore those with few or no PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory). The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review. However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in an overall budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In effect, where a person was paid, including with the support of the TWSS scheme which was in operation between March and September 2020, for any day within this period, then they cannot also receive a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for that day.  </p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme from 1st September 2020.  Subject to satisfying the relevant eligibility criteria, employees may claim casual (i.e. part-time) jobseeker payments or Short-Time Work Support payments for days of unemployment, even where their employer is claiming the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme for days of employment. </p>  <p>  Each case is examined individually on the basis of the information supplied by the employer to determine entitlement. </p>  <p>  As with all the schemes administered by my Department, if a customer is not satisfied with a Deciding Officer's decision, they have the right to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. Government has provided &euro;46.02 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2021. </p><p>The ENP and UNP schemes are demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. This is done in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  </p><p>The legislation providing for ENPs and UNPs does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to a payment.  The principal consideration in making a payment under these schemes is to address a particular need.  The Community Welfare Service officers consider all the circumstances of the case when examining an application for support.  </p><p>Where a tenant cannot furnish the property from within his/her own resources, s/he can apply for an exceptional needs payment to assist them in furnishing the property. Assistance can be provided in respect of necessary housing related items including bedding, flooring, furniture and household appliances.  The level of furnishings and appliances required will depend on an assessment of size and nature of the proposed property, the expected level of occupancy and items already available to the customer.  Every case is based on the individual circumstances and needs of the household. </p><p>ENPs for goods and services should be based on the most reasonable price at which the article or service can be obtained by the customer. In order to establish this, three quotations should be supplied from customers applying for ENPs where this is possible. </p><p>The tabular statement that follows shows the number of payments made under the ENP and UNP scheme each year since 2018.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment should contact my Department's Community Welfare Service.  My Department has established an Income Support Line - 1890 800 024 &ndash; which can be used by customers at this time to contact the Department.  Staff can advise them on how to make an application for assistance from the Department.</p><p>If the Deputy has concerns about a particular case, I would ask him to bring it to the attention of my Department.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of Payments</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>112,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>92,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>67,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (end of April)</td>       <td>18,750</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

All schemes operate to published processing times which are subject to ongoing monitoring and review. Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.

The rate of IQA payable may amount to 90% of the maximum State pension (contributory), depending on the rate of State pension (contributory) in payment to the person&rsquo;s spouse and the person&rsquo;s own means, solely or jointly held.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These contracts have been in place in many cases for over 20 years with no formal procurement being undertaken in that period.  This is not in compliance with the requirements of good governance or proper procurement and my Department is therefore developing RFTs to ensure that sufficient high-quality employment services are procured in a manner that is compatible with EU and national procurement rules. This phase will also see an expansion of services that will include County Galway, currently without a local employment service.</p>  <p>  Organisations, including LES providers in conjunction with other community organisations, who have strong experience in the delivery of similar services at a community and local level will be in a strong position to respond to these RFTs.</p></reply>

Following this, the Department of Health requested the Adoption Board to contact Adoption Societies to determine the extent of this practice. The responses from these Adoption Societies were passed to the Department of Health at that time. </p>  <p>  During the recent sampling review into illegal birth registrations, the Adoption Authority of Ireland discovered a file containing this 1996 correspondence. This was brought to the attention of my Department in April 2019. My Department requested the Adoption Authority of Ireland to confirm that this material had been provided to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, which they did. A full copy of this file was also provided to the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection to assist in his work on appropriate next steps in cases of illegal birth registration. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged by all parties that adoption in the past was a secretive process, carried out without due respect for the rights and dignity of those involved. Such practice in adoption reflects wider societal prejudices of the time. </p>  <p>  Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. Modern day adoption legislation and practice also ensures that the rights of all involved are vindicated, including birth fathers, within the overarching framework of working for the best interests of the child involved.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the suggestion of an audit of records, I am very conscious that every record on adoption represents the lives of a number of individuals. There are major ethical issues at play where the reality, identity and family and legal relationships that people have lived their whole lives may be fundamentally undermined. I am also concerned that the records may simply not exist, to effectively revisit adoptions that have taken place.  </p>  <p>  From listening to survivors I believe that what is most important as an immediate priority is access to birth certificates and early life information for adoptees. The Deputy will be aware that I recently published proposed Birth Information and Tracing legislation, which will, for the first time, enshrine in law the right of access to birth certificates, and other birth and early life information. </p>  <p>  This legislation, supported by a strong and supportive information and tracing service, should ensure that any individual with a question about their origins is empowered to access their own records and is supported with regard to any related needs.</p></reply>

However, under national Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions it was not possible to continue the clinics.  It is expected that these clinics will resume in the near future as restrictions continue to be eased. </p>  <p>  While such supports are made available to all residents who have been granted a status it is always open to them and any other residents to make their own arrangements for accommodation at any time, if they so wish, and many do so.  </p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the Deputy that this year, in the period up to the end of April, 367 people have moved to housing in the community from our accommodation centres and over 90% (332) received assistance from the support services outlined. </p>  <p>  The percentage of residents availing of the supports is currently in excess of the proportion for 2020, when a total of 1,136 people moved to accommodation in the community, of whom 799 or just over 70% received assistance from these support services. </p></reply>

Included in First 5 is a commitment to designing a new Funding Model to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of early learning and care and school-age childcare. The new Funding Model will be designed to support Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare provision to contribute to reducing inequalities and enhance the offering for children and families in the context of poverty and disadvantage.  In this context, First 5 specifically refers to developing enhanced contracts whereby additional funding would be available for the provision of high-quality ELC settings in communities of concentrated disadvantage... such a model may include additional funding for smaller staff:child ratios, family liaison staff, additional parent supports, and provision of food.</p><p>In September 2019, my predecessor announced the establishment of an Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The group is considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. Since their first meeting in November 2019, the Expert Group has met fifteen times and they have made significant progress in their work.</p><p>To support the Expert Group's work, Frontier Economics was selected to deliver a significant programme of research to the Expert Group. Frontier Economics has delivered eight research papers to inform the Expert Group's work, covering international comparisons and funding approaches, staffing, affordability mechanisms, access and inclusion, quality, and collaboration.  Working Paper 5 (Approaches to Identifying Children or Settings in Need of Additional Support) and Working Paper 6 (Funding Models Addressing Early Childhood Disadvantage) are of particular relevance to the work to develop ELC/SAC services to contribute to tackling disadvantage. </p><p>The Expert Group is also undertaking consultation and engagement with stakeholders. Phase 1 of this consultation and engagement took place between August and December 2020, comprising a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars and focused discussions with providers, practitioners and parents. Phases 2 and 3 of consultation and engagement is ongoing, involving a series of facilitated events that bring together different perspectives to engage deeply in the conversation about how the various issues of affordability, sustainability, quality and inclusion interact and how the new Funding Model can best support these objectives.  A number of organisations who have experience and understanding of dynamics of disadvantage and children's early years are participating in the consultation. </p><p>It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted to me in November 2021 for consideration before submission to wider Government. I anticipate that the work of the Expert Group will contribute to informing the development of a revised funding model aimed at providing additional supports to address socio-economic disadvantage in Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare. These supports, having regard to experience and evidence from the operation of the DEIS model, may involve a range of financial, informational and material resources to meet its goals.</p><p>Material relating to the Funding Model, including meeting papers, research papers, and reports, is available on a dedicated website, <i>www.first5fundingmodel.ie</i>.</p></reply>

All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme, which are applied impartially to all applicants.</p><p>Applications for a maintenance grant are means-tested based on the reckonable income from the previous tax year.  For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications were assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p><p>However, Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2020 provides for a review of eligibility during the academic year if there is a permanent change in circumstance in respect of certain specified criteria, such as reckonable income.  Applicants must provide satisfactory documentation to the awarding authority to confirm that the reduction in income is permanent. Examples of documentation for income from self-employment include confirmation that a business has ceased trading or confirmation that the income from self-employment has been replaced with a means-tested social welfare payment. Fluctuations in income from self-employment are not considered a permanent change in circumstances for student grant purposes. However, an applicant will receive the benefit of any decrease in income over the year when grant eligibility for the following academic year is reviewed.</p><p>Any student who believes their student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via <i>www.studentgrantappeals.ie</i>. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students can apply for supports under the Student Assistance Fund. The fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be interested in the Policy Map, which notes the responsibilities of each Department and which is available at the link - . </p><p>I have also included below details of the goals my Department is responsible for, and the progress made in implementing these goals. </p><p>I. Under the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan, a number of Education strategies and plans have been identified as key to implementing SDG 4 &ndash; Quality Education which spans ensuring:- </p><p>A. equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university (4.3)</p><p>B. increasing youth and adults who have skills for employment and entrepreneurship (4.4)</p><p>C. gender disparities are eliminated and equal access to all levels of education (4.5)</p><p>D. all youth and substantial proportion of adults achieve literacy and numeracy (4.6) </p><p>E. all learners acquire skills, knowledge to promote sustainable development (4.7)</p><p>II.  </p><p>A. </p><p>1. National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (SDG 4.3, 4.5)</p><p>B.</p><p>1. A Public Consultation for the development of a new National Access Plan opened on 16th April 2021 and is open until Friday 21 May 2021.</p><p>2. National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2016-2020 (SDG 4.5) </p><p>C.</p><p>1. The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) which is under the remit of the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth  provides the framework and strategic direction for interventions across Government Departments to support the additional needs of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  </p><p>D.</p><p>1.</p><p>2. Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024 (SDG 4.3, 4.4, 4.6)</p><p>E. </p><p>1. The FET Strategy implementation plan is currently in development by SOLAS. Wider consultation will take place with DFHERIS and other key stakeholders in Q3, 2021 to establish working groups and associated timelines for work streams and priorities.  </p><p>2. National Skills Strategy 2025 (SDG 4.4, 4.5)</p><p>a) The National Skills Strategy 2016-2025 (NSS) was published in 2016 and makes recommendations in the skills arena for the period to 2025. </p><p>(1) The Strategy sets out a wide range of actions under six key objectives aimed at improving the development, supply and use of skills over the next decade. The objectives are:</p><p>(a) 1. Education and training providers will place a stronger focus on providing skills development opportunities that are relevant to the needs of learners, society and the economy.</p><p>(b) 2. Employers will participate actively in the development of skills and make effective use of skills in their organisations to improve productivity and competitiveness.</p><p>(c) 3. The quality of teaching and learning at all stages of education will be continually enhanced and evaluated.</p><p>(d) 4. People across Ireland will engage more in lifelong learning.</p><p>(e) 5. There will be a specific focus on active inclusion to support participation in education and training and the labour market.</p><p>(f) 6. We will support an increase in the supply of skills to the labour market.</p><p>(2) </p><p>(a) Since the publication of the NSS in 2016, the changes that were anticipated for the future world of work have accelerated, including those around Industry 4.0, automation and digitisation. The new technologies and new skills associated with these trends bring with them requirements in relation to upskilling and reskilling for those in employment and those seeking employment, as well as requirements in relation to the content of tertiary education.  It is timely to review and revitalise the skills strategy, architecture and overarching approach for Ireland in order to ensure that our skills framework continues to be fit for purpose and to work on the basis of partnership with industry in driving forward the skills agenda and responding to the challenges that face us as our economy reopens and recovers.</p><p>(3)</p><p>(a) </p><p>(4)</p><p>(a) </p><p>(5)10 year Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy (SDG 4.6)</p><p>b)</p><p>(1)SOLAS has been tasked with developing a 10 year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy. An interdepartmental stakeholder group, chaired by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is overseeing the development of the strategy. Public consultation on the strategy took place between Nov-Dec 2020, and the strategy is due to be finalised in Q2 2021.</p><p>c)</p><p>(1) </p><p>(2)National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (SDG 4.7)</p><p>d)</p><p>(1)The National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) 2014-2020 has now expired but significant progress was made over the period spanning early childhood education to higher education and beyond, and a report is being compiled in this respect.  Achievements included:-</p><p>(a) the introduction of additional undergraduate and postgraduate programmes relevant to sustainable development; </p><p>(b) the integration of sustainable development criteria in initial teacher education programmes;</p><p>(c) increased participation in the Green Campus programme among higher education institutions;</p><p>(d) increased pipeline of research and researchers with expertise on the SDGs and Sustainability achieved, through research funding calls with a specific focus on these areas. </p><p>(2)</p><p>(a) Building on the success of the existing strategy, the Department, together with the Department of Education will jointly develop a new strategy for ESD to 2030, aligned to the UNESCO Framework for ESD for 2030 and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 4.7.  ESD to 2030 will be informed by a process of stakeholder engagement and public consultation and will aim to extend ESD to the informal and non-formal education sectors, raise awareness, increase youth participation and links with communities.  Development will be overseen by the ESD Advisory Group.  The public consultation was launched on Earth Day (22ndApril 2021) and will remain open until the end of June 2021. Both Departments will continue to engage with key stakeholders including the further and higher education and schools communities into the early autumn with a view to publishing a new strategy for ESD to 2030 in early 2022.</p><p>(3)</p><p>(a) As well as being a target in itself, ESD is also considered a key enabler for achieving all 17 SDGs.</p><p>(4)Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - Statement of Strategy 2021-2023</p><p>I.The SDG Implementation Plan calls for a reference in Statements of Strategy where Departments have lead responsibility to implement SDG goals.  The Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 includes a clear commitment to sustainability and embeds goals and actions throughout that are aligned with the SDG Goals and Targets, where the Department is named as a lead of stakeholder department. </p><p>II.Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors (SDG 8.2)</p><p>I. </p><p>I.My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy is a clear articulation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to support and strengthen the national research and innovation ecosystem and position Ireland as a leading knowledge-driven economy. Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy for research and development, science and technology has come to a conclusion but its vision for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society continues to be valid today. </p><p>I.A new national research and innovation strategy is currently under development at DFHERIS. A number of areas of key importance to the next strategy have already emerged including key thematic challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health and the role that research and innovation plays in not only finding solutions to these issues but also identifying opportunities across these areas. Working with departments and agencies across Government, the new strategy will strengthen the capability and capacity of our research and innovation system to deliver excellence and impact and make a real difference to the lives of all our citizens, whether it be through breakthrough health discoveries, addressing climate challenges or creating new, high quality jobs for the knowledge economy.</p><p>I.The Programme for Government commits to creating better opportunities through education and research and ensuring that Ireland is a global leader in research and innovation across the arts, humanities, social sciences and STEM. Research and innovation will be fundamental to addressing our economic and social challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health and as such the new strategy will be aligned with the SDGs. </p><p>II.Climate Action (SDG 13) </p><p>Climate Action features prominently in the Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2021-2023. The Department is also contributing actively to the preparation of the new Climate Action Plan. The research and innovation sectors will play an important role, including advancing innovative and technological solutions that will in turn be critical to enable sectors across the economy to meet the ambitious targets set for 2030 and 2050. There will also be a key role for the tertiary education sector to ensure reskilling and upskilling for climate action, including new skills required in the green transition such as  retrofitting. </p><p>In terms of progress made since 2018, the Human Capital Initiative has provided significant funding for courses that include a focus on the environment, climate change and sustainability. Across HCI Pillars 1 and 2, sixteen courses with a specific focus on environment/energy/sustainability/circular economy were approved, providing almost 1000 course places for learners. </p><p>HCI Pillar 3, included a specific focus on climate action, with a requirement that funded programmes include consideration of how they can positively assist the diverse and wide-ranging impacts that Climate Change will have on Ireland&rsquo;s environment, society, economic and natural resources. A number of HCI projects with notable components addressing climate action, environment and sustainability were awarded funding under this call and will have wide-reaching impacts, given the multi-partner collaborative approach adopted in many instances. </p><p>A number of Springboard courses in 2020 and additional places provided on Postgraduate and Modular courses provided as part of the July Stimulus package in 2020, also included a focus on environment/sustainability.</p><p>A new round of Springboard+ courses is due to be launched in the coming weeks, and the call for proposals included sustainability and the low carbon economy as an area of focus for courses under the call. </p><p>There are 40 higher education institutions registered on the Green Campus Programme, managed by An Taisce, to Q4 2020. 15 of these campuses have been awarded the Green Flag, with 8 new registrations in 2020. </p><p>I and my Department are committed to making  progress on the SDGs and will continue in our programmes of work as set out above in order to advance this important agenda.</p></reply>

This is in addition to additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year, which will depend on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the Higher Education Institutions.  Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  My Department is however monitoring the situation as it develops and my officials are working with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where there is scope for additional places to be provided. All bodies involved will continue to work to ensure the availability of a full range of options for applicants in 2021 and in future years.</p>  <p>  In addition to higher education, there is a range of options available in further education and training and apprenticeships. These options can serve both as an alternate pathway to a chosen career or an alternate pathway into higher education.

The funding allocated to my Department, as set down in the annual Estimates, is used to meet costs associated with the provision of further and higher education, labour market initiatives including skills, and Irish research and development.  The allocation is provided both directly and through my Department&rsquo;s aegis bodies to fund: i) the salaries and pensions of public sector workers in the higher education, further education and research sectors, ii) the day to day running costs and capital investment needs of higher and further education institutions, iii) Irish research including through Science Foundation Ireland, iv) skills and labour market initiatives through SOLAS and the National Training Fund, v) the general administration costs of my Department, etc. Funding is also allocated for a range of programmes and initiatives.</p>  <p>  In the course of its work my Department makes a significant number of payments. Such payments are made to individuals and organisations both by way of grants and also for the provision of goods and services to it. Some of the recipients of this funding may be non-governmental organisations or charities, however as that label is not necessarily assigned to payees it is not possible to provide an accurate and complete list of such recipients. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with the names of specific non-governmental organisations or charities I will arrange to have the level of funding, if any, paid to them provided to him without delay.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would point out that the annual Revised Estimates for Public Services and the Appropriation Accounts published for my Department&rsquo;s Vote provides information regarding expenditure and receipts that may be of further assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The factors which underlie youth crime have significant implications across a range of policy and service provisions, including Child and Family Services, Health, Education and local authority functions.   </p>  <p>  This new Strategy will respond collaboratively to the situation of vulnerable children and young</p>  <p>  people, with a strong focus on diverting them away from offending, and building supports to provide prevention and early intervention, family support and diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p>  <p>  The Strategy will seek to increase the range and quality of supports available to support positive personal development and behavioural change to lead to positive outcomes for the young people involved and their families.</p>  <p>  This will be achieved through strengthening and enhancing the supports provided through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) around the country. The geographical coverage of the service will be expanded so that, within two years, it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it. In particular, GYDP services will be enhanced to provide:</p>  <p>  - early intervention and engagement with more challenging children and young people whose needs may be too complex for the existing GYDP services;</p>  <p>  - family support;</p>  <p>  - engagement with younger children (8-11 years); and</p>  <p>  - support to schools in relation to the retention of young people with challenging behaviour in the education system.</p>  <p>  While Garda Youth Diversion Projects primarily receive referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they may receive referrals from other sources including schools, parents or self-referrals.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a less adversarial resolution of disputes.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, the Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. In the preparation of the General Scheme, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System, published in October 2019.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published or to predict the timeframe for the legislative process with regard to the Bill after its publication. </p>  <p>  Also in September 2020, the Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. This group will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill.  The establishment of this Group recognises the need to involve the key state bodies who will need to deliver this substantial reform at the earliest stage in the process. Membership of this group includes officials from my Department as well as representatives from the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. In addition, the Chief Justice has nominated three members of the judiciary to the group representing the district, circuit and high courts - all of whom have extensive experience of dealing with family law cases - to contribute on the practical elements of implementing this change.</p>  <p>  The overall aim is to change the culture so that the focus of the family justice system meets the complex needs of people who need help with family justice issues.</p></reply>

I also received approval on that date to draft a general scheme of a Bill to put the new NRM on a statutory footing. </p>  <p>  Human trafficking is a particularly cruel crime, based on deception and exploitation of vulnerable people, and it is hidden. Due to its hidden nature, it is very difficult to detect and investigate. This reform should make it easier to reach and protect victims.  </p>  <p>  The NRM provides a way for all agencies, both State and civil society, to cooperate, share information about potential victims, identify those victims and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support. It is the framework through which States fulfil obligations to protect and promote the human rights of trafficking victims. The proposals I have brought to Government will make it easier for victims to come forward and be officially recognised as victims of human trafficking in order to receive appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  It will also make it easier for the State to provide that support and protection in a collaborative way across the range of departments and agencies, and working with key NGOs. I want to stress how important this proposal is, not only in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s substantive response on how we reach and protect victims of this heinous crime &ndash; which is the most important thing &ndash; but also on our international reputation. </p>  <p>  Currently, when suspected victims of human trafficking are encountered by, or referred to, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are provided with a wide range of services by both the Government and NGOs through the NRM. It is widely accepted that having the Garda&iacute; as the sole competent authority for the formal recognition of people as victims of human trafficking is not an adequate response. Many victims will not approach the police due to a mistrust of police, but may be more comfortable approaching a different state body, or an NGO. </p>  <p>  This new approach acknowledges that, in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to the National Referral Mechanism. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are excellent in their role as our competent authority but we know some victims, because of interactions they may have had with law enforcement officials in other jurisdictions, have a perception that police can not be trusted. </p>  <p>  We want to be sure that every victim of trafficking is identified and helped so that we can support them. Doing this will also help us gather more information and evidence in order to bring to justice the traffickers who prey on vulnerable people with no regard for the lives and safety of their victims. The new NRM we are proposing to introduce will provide a variety of avenues for victims of trafficking to be identified and find a route to the services we have available.</p>  <p>  In addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is being proposed that the following agencies will become competent authorities for the identification of victims of human trafficking: </p>  <p>  - Department of Justice Immigration Services</p>  <p>  - Department of Social Protection</p>  <p>  - The HSE</p>  <p>  - Tusla</p>  <p>  - Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth </p>  <p>  - International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS)</p>  <p>  These agencies each already have interaction with potential victims of human trafficking. The agencies will together form a National Referral Mechanism Operational Committee, which will make decisions on entry of victims into the NRM. In addition, some NGOs will be designated as &lsquo;trusted partners&rsquo; and will also be able to refer victims to the NRM, which creates an alternative and trusted pathway to enter the NRM, aside from through interaction with State agencies. </p>  <p>  There is considerable detailed work to be done yet to get the revised NRM up-and-running and the Department of Justice is committed to working through all the detail in a collaborative spirit with Departments, agencies and with the key NGO partners.   </p>  <p>  These proposals follow the recent announcement by Minister McEntee of an initiative to expunge previous convictions for &lsquo;sale of sex&rsquo;, or prostitution offences, and are a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking, and those forced to provide sexual services. </p>  <p>  The Department is also working with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Ireland on a Cultural Mediation project.  The project will build the capacity of State professionals who work with/for migrants, to identify and address the needs of (potential) victims of gender based violence and trafficking more effectively and to provide culturally sensitive support to them. It will also allow victims of gender based violence and trafficking better access to information and effectively engage with support and referral services and will promote a culturally sensitive approach to victims, through the use of cultural mediators.</p></reply>

The coroner is an independent quasi-judicial office holder whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. This is an important public service to the living and in particular to the next-of-kin and friends of the deceased. Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved, but also perform a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns.</p>  <p>  The Deputy references two reports or reviews, which I will address separately in turn. </p>  <p>  The report from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) - Death Investigation, Coroners&rsquo; Inquests and the Rights of the Bereaved - was published on 21 April last. The ICCL noted on its publication, that it had not sought to consult with, or to be in contact with, my Department prior to its publication and instead desired that my Department should study the report and the 52 recommendations contained therein. </p>  <p>  On 11 May 2021, senior officials of my Department met with the ICCL and the report&rsquo;s authors who outlined the development of the report and the various issues concerned. My Department will now proceed to examine the report and its recommendations in detail, as indicated to the ICCL. </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of the Coroner Service published in December 2000, was a significant milestone in the process of modernising our death investigation service, strengthening coroners&rsquo; powers and to provide for a major administrative restructuring of the coroner system. The report proposed that the coroner would remain an independent office holder, but there was no proposal to alter the position whereby the coroner is not permitted to consider or determine matters of civil or criminal liability at inquest &ndash; these are matters reserved to the Courts established under the Constitution.</p>  <p>  In 2002, my Department worked with coroners and other stakeholders including the Faculty of Pathology of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the then Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Attorney General, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Samaritans to form a Rules Committee. The Report of the Coroners Rules Committee, published in 2003 proposed new rules for the work of the coroner and good practice guidelines.</p>  <p>  The Coroners Bill 2007, incorporated many of the more than 100 recommendations contained in the 2000 Review. It also had regard to the proposals of the Rules Committee. However, due to the major challenges then confronting public finances, the administrative restructuring proposed in the 2007 Bill was not progressed following Second Stage in the Seanad. </p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations of the 2000 review related to the strengthening of the legal provisions regarding the work of the coroner. In this regard, there has been significant implementation of many of the relevant recommendations, sometimes to a greater extent than that envisaged by the review in the intervening period. Such improvements were effected through amendments to the Coroners Act 1962 in 2005, 2011, 2013, 2019 and 2020 as follows. </p>  <p>  - The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005 ended the restriction on the number of medical witnesses allowed at inquest. </p>  <p>  - The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for the restructuring and amalgamation of coronial districts. Coroner districts within counties have been amalgamated as the opportunities have arisen. There were 48 districts in 2000, there are 39 now and this will reduce to 38 within 2021. </p>  <p>  - The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for legal aid and legal advice by certification by the coroner to the Legal Aid Board in relation to inquests. </p>  <p>  - The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 clarified, strengthened and modernised coroner&rsquo;s powers in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths. The scope of enquires at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death, to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Act also broadened the coroner&rsquo;s powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquesting of maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations and significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest. </p>  <p>  - The Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 provided, among other items, for the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners to act simultaneously with other coroners in exceptional circumstances to be utilised as part of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively consider the optimum organisation of the coroner service.  It  has taken responsibility for the Dublin Coroner Office from the local authorities since 1 January 2018. We have greatly increased the resources available to that Office in the intervening period. The related mortuary and post-mortem examination facilities, which are also available to the Office of State Pathologist have also been improved and extra resources provided.</p></reply>

For the most part, the underspend relates to work on capital projects impacted by Covid 19 restrictions, and hence more of the cost than originally envisaged falling due in 2021 and later years.  </p>  <p>  The Justice Vote accounts for &euro;18.75 million of the underspend. This is directly related to the Forensic Science Ireland laboratory project. The expenditure of circa &euro;16 million in 2021 was significantly less than the available budget, as the Covid 19 restrictions came into place very shortly after the commencement of the main construction works in March 2020.  </p>  <p>  A carryover to 2021 of &euro;3.9 million from the underspend was  provided under the capital carryover provisions, bringing the total budget for the project to just under &euro;55 million in 2021. Despite the Covid 19 restrictions, the project is making good progress and is due to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.</p>  <p>  The Prisons and Courts Votes had underspends of almost &euro;7 million and &euro;6.55 million respectively, and were mainly related to the timing of payments in relation to capital projects,  which will now be incurred in 2021. It was possible to carryover a large proportion of this underspend in additional capital funding for 2021; almost &euro;5.5 million in the case of Prisons and circa &euro;4.9 million in Courts.</p>  <p>  The remainder of the underspend relates to the Data Protection Commission Vote, &euro;4.7 million which is due in part to slower than expected take on of additional staff, due to the requirement to move recruitment completely online during 2020. </p>  <p>  There was an underspend of &euro;600,000 in respect of the Policing Authority Vote, largely arising from less expenditure than expected on non-pay costs mainly due to the impact of Covid 19.</p></reply>

The Deputy will note that the target number of identifications for 2021, as outlined in the FSI Performance Delivery Agreement 2021, has been set at 80.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that these figures were projected before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and before Citizenship Division became aware of the impact the pandemic would have on its processing capabilities. </p>  <p>  The processing of citizenship applications in particular has been presented with a number of challenges over the past two years. In the first instance, a judicial review was taken in the High Court in 2019, by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to his absences from the State during the last year continuous prior to the date of his application. The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of citizenship applications in 2019 and in 2020. This has been seriously compounded by COVID-19 restrictions from March 2020, which has resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services. The priority at all times is to balance operational outcomes with staff and public safety, complying fully with HSE and Government guidelines.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that citizenship ceremonies have been temporarily suspended during the pandemic, in the interest of public safety. </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2021, a temporary system that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty was opened. Approximately 2,014 people have received their Irish citizenship since then.  A further 1,823 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and the Immigration Service of my Department will be sending them their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  We communicated with a further 1,000 people in April and 1,500 more will be communicated with by the end of June.  At that point, we will have communicated with all those that were recorded, as at 30 December 2020, as having been in the system 24 months or more and 6,500 people, will have been given the opportunity to complete their Irish citizenship. </p>  <p>  Those receiving a communication from my Department are being invited to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  In addition, additional staffing resources have been assigned to Citizenship Division to deal with the backlog of applications. Applications have continued to be accepted at all times during the pandemic, despite the operational challenges. Procedural initiatives recently introduced including moving the Garda vetting process from a paper based one to a fully digital platform, and accelerating the number of applications utilising on-line payments, have the potential to radically improve efficiency and reduce processing times.</p></reply>

Although incitement to hatred is already an offence, experience has shown that it is difficult to prosecute and there have been very few convictions since the introduction of the 1989 Act. </p><p>As part of the work to prepare this proposed legislation, a comprehensive public consultation was carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. In addition, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.</p><p>The purpose of this work was to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that all legislative proposals are developed and put forward bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution and our human rights obligations.</p><p>The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, provided for in the Irish Constitution and in both the European Convention on Human Rights and in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, like other rights in our Constitution, it is not an absolute right, and can be limited or restricted by law. This can only happen where there are compelling reasons, including protecting other fundamental human rights. Any such limitation or restriction must be necessary, proportionate and explicitly provided for in law.</p><p>I am confident that the approach taken to the reform of our legislation in this area will ensure that the legislation introduced plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future. This is the mission of my Department and as Minister I am fully committed to combatting incitement to hatred and hate crime as a key part of this.</p></reply>

The General Scheme was finalised following extensive engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which worked closely with my Department to identify the legislative changes required in respect of the new Operating Model.</p>  <p>  Among these changes is the removal of references to districts from the statute book to ensure there are no legislative impediments to the roll-out of the new operating model. The Statutory Regulations which govern the operation of all Garda representative associations are among the pieces of secondary legislation which will require review to remove references to districts and other subsequent amendments. Consultation will take place with stakeholders, including the Garda associations, in advance of any changes to Regulations being made.</p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that there are no actions in APSFF which lead directly to reforming the Garda associations. However, there have been a number of changes in recent years to the industrial relations environment in which these associations operate, notably the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019, which gave Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for collective Industrial Relations matters. These matters are the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department, in conjunction with the Garda authorities.</p></reply>

I am aware that Dublin City Council closed off Portobello plaza last weekend as a result of the antisocial behaviour seen in the area.</p>  <p>  As the restrictions are eased and the economy and society returns to normal, changes in the pattern of crime will require an appropriate response, and this will be kept under constant review by the Commissioner and his management team. Many crimes, like anti-social behaviour, tend to fluctuate seasonally and I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adapt their focus accordingly throughout the year.</p>  <p>  All of us must hold firm in our adherence to public health regulations and make conscientious decisions regarding behaviour that will not adversely impact our communities. I would encourage the public to make the most of the outdoors this summer in a responsible manner.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. A sub-group of the forum has already considered measures which can be taken with regard to the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in communities and similar sub groups can also be established for other issues where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour will also be considered by the Local Community Safety Partnerships which are to be set up in every local authority under the Department&rsquo;s new community safety policy. These new structures, which will build upon and replace Joint Policing Committees, are a key part of the new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, the general scheme of which was recently published by my Department. Three pilot partnerships are currently being established in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Longford and Waterford and will run for the next two years ahead of the nationwide rollout.</p></reply>

The Courts Service advises that it is committed to their full restoration at the earliest possible date. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the restoration work is a complex task requiring specialist conservation and iron-working expertise. The Courts Service does not have this expertise itself and is reliant on the resources of the Office of Public Works (OPW) to undertake and manage the task. I am further informed that the OPW has adopted a very thorough approach to this project and a great deal of background work has been undertaken by the OPW, including technical appraisals, investigations and experimental repairs. Due to the size, complexity and anticipated high cost of the project, the actual restoration work will be undertaken in stages and as funding allows. The first phase of the restoration works will see ten of the 66 bays/sections restored. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service further advises me that the OPW are managing a competitive procurement process to select a contractor with the necessary expertise and skills to undertake the phase 1 restoration. An invitation to tender for the restoration of the initial ten sections issued earlier in the year with a closing date of 26 March 2021. I understand that responses received are being evaluated at present and it is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly. The Courts Service has allocated funding in 2021, to cover the anticipated cost of the phase 1 restoration of the initial ten sections. This initial work will inform how future phases will be undertaken.</p></reply>

This improved infrastructure, in addition to the continued success of the Cycle to Work scheme and other initiatives have led to a significant increase in the number of cyclists and bikes on our roads in recent years. </p>  <p>  Inevitably this has also attracted thieves and unfortunately many cyclists have experienced the theft of very valuable bicycles. It is vital that steps are taken to stop this kind of theft and that cyclists know they can trust that their bike is safe. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there are a number of initiatives being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle bike theft, including the &lsquo;Lock it or Lose it&rsquo; initiative which was announced on 13 May, which focuses on reminding the public to take extra precautions to keep their bikes safe by locking them in the most secure way possible.</p>  <p>  The Blue Bike scheme has also been designed to highlight bike theft hotspots by placing an end of life bike, painted blue, in such areas with a large sign warning members of the public to lock their bikes and be aware of bike theft. This scheme has three goals:</p>  <p>  - To warn the public that bike thieves are operating in the area;</p>  <p>  - To deter crime by informing offenders that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are monitoring the area; and</p>  <p>  - To thereby create a safer place for members of the public to lock and secure their bikes.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, in addition to the &lsquo;Lock it or Lose it&rsquo; and Blue Bike initiatives, Garda&iacute; will be resuming property marking schemes and the use of so-called &lsquo;bait bicycles&rsquo; in areas which have been identified as bike theft hotspots as we emerge from COVID-19. Other responses that will be pursued by Garda&iacute; include surveillance of known offenders, the monitoring of any offenders&rsquo; current bail conditions and where necessary the appropriate action of any breach of their bail with the relevant courts, and proactive policing, both overt and covert, of hotspot areas. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that theft is an offence under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. Anyone convicted of theft is liable to a penalty of a fine or up to 10 years imprisonment. Under section 14 of the Act, someone found guilty of robbery (theft using coercion or force) is potentially liable on conviction on indictment to life imprisonment. As the Deputy will appreciate, the sentence in any individual case is a matter for the relevant Judge.</p>  <p>  In instances where children may be involved in this type of theft, work will also continue under the recently published Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 to prevent offending behaviour from occurring and diverting children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system. The immediate priority within the new Strategy will be to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects across the State.</p></reply>

In 2019, NGOs and charities received &euro;31,475,894 in funding from the Department of Justice. </p><p>However, as the Deputy will be aware, in October 2020, a number of functions in my Department were transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Therefore, some funding provided by my Department transferred during 2020, in particular, funding related to the integration and equality functions. The amount of funding received by NGOs and charities from the Department in 2020 was &euro;20,237,670.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that my Department funds a network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) throughout the state.  As set out in the recently-published Youth Justice Strategy, arrangements are in train to ensure a significant development of the work of the GYDPs.  In particular, enhancement will be made to GYDP services in the areas of:</p><p>- Early intervention and engagement with more challenging children and young people whose needs may be too complex for the existing GYDP services</p><p>- Family support</p><p>- Engagement with younger children (8-11 years) </p><p>- Work with schools to support retention of young people with challenging behaviour in the  education system</p><p>Some areas do not currently have a GYDP service. The Strategy proposes to achieve full national coverage within two years, principally by extending the operating area of existing projects, but a small number of new projects will also be required.</p><p>My Department also funds NGOs to provide supports to victims of crime, particularly of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and of human trafficking. The supports funded include information and advice, and court accompaniment, but do not include provision of services for which the HSE or Tusla have responsibility. </p></reply>

The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisors as well as various Statutory Consultees. The legislation also provides for a period of Public Consultation. In addition, the legislation governing aquaculture licensing provides for an appeals mechanism. Appeals in relation to aquaculture licence decisions are a matter for the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board (ALAB), which is an independent statutory body.</p><p>Decisions in respect of aquaculture licence applications in Castlemaine Harbour were made in 2018.  A number of these decisions were subsequently appealed to ALAB. The Board has recently informed my Department that it has confirmed the decision of the Minister in respect of these applications. Queries in respect of ALAB decisions are a matter for the Board who can be contacted at info@alab.ie.  <b></b></p><p>In relation to a review of the relevant legislation, the Report of the Independent Aquaculture Licensing Review Group recommended that work commence on the preparation of new Aquaculture legislation. Since receiving the Report, my Department has prioritised the elimination of the shellfish licensing backlog, which has resulted in over 1,250 licence determinations being made since 2012. My Department is now focusing on the development of a web-based Aquaculture Application and Monitoring System. Phase 1 of this project is currently in development and due for completion by the end of 2021.</p><p>The Implementation of the Licensing Review Group Report forms an important part of the current Programme for Government. My Department is currently preparing an Implementation Programme in respect of the remaining recommendations of the Report with a view to their implementation both as they apply directly to my Department and to the Agencies of my Department, having regard to the legislative, environmental, technical and public interest issues that arise.</p></reply>

In making a decision regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically-connected European Sites. For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km.</p>  <p>  This was one of the reasons why 3km was not deemed appropriate. There were a number of factors influencing the Department's change to the radius of 15km, including advice from our environmental consultants, judgements form the Forestry Appeals Committee, guidance provided by the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service and established sector from other sectors.</p></reply>

For instance,  we are implementing internal changes to improve output including training, increased assistance to ecologists in the preparation of files, improved IT resources for ecologists and other system improvements. In addition, we are engaging intensively with the sector who also have a role to play by is focusing on improvement in the quality and consistency of applications and subsequent information including NISs.</p>  <p>  Overall, we have set ourselves a target to issue 4,500 licences in 2021 which is a 75% increase on 2020 and we fully intend to meet this target. I remain confident that the changes presented under the Project Woodland structure to processes within my Department will bear fruit, particularly to give confidence to all applicants that they can receive a timely decision on their forestry licence application.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of EU exceptional aid and Exchequer support.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme - Article 1 (3) of (EU) 2019/1132 refers. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the reduction period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the reference period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019.</p>  <p>  As set out in 7.1.1.1 of the Terms and Conditions of BEAM, "where an applicant's particpation in a pre-existing scheme or programme, administered by the Department, or where a pre-existing legal obligation requires a minimum number of bovine livestock, and where achieving such reduction would result in a failure to meet that requirement, an applicant must apply to the Department for a derogation prior to 30 September 2019".</p>  <p>  The farmer named previously submitted an appeal for animals that had to be slaughtered early due to a TB outbreak on his holding. He was unsuccessful in that appeal.</p>  <p>  A new and different appeal has now been lodged requesting a derogation from the 5% reduction requirement. This appeal has been unsuccessful and the farmer notified, including his right to appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.</p></reply>

The first National Implementation Plan (2018-2020), published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. An important element of this Plan is the SDG Policy Map and Matrix, which identified the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets and also mapped national sectoral policies against the 17 SDGs and all 169 related targets, in order to identify which policies were most relevant to which SDGs and their associated targets. </p><p>The SDG Policy Map and Matrix enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and Targets. This policy map has recently been updated and is available online at gov.ie. The Department is a lead on the following five SDGs:</p><p>- Goal 2: Zero Hunger</p><p>- Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</p><p>- Goal 14: Life below Water</p><p>- Goal 15: Life on Land</p><p>- Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals</p><p>Progress on these is published on .</p><p>As part of the National Implementation Plan 2018-2020, there was a commitment to include reference in all new Statements of Strategy to all SDG targets for which a Department has lead responsibility. This Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy includes the SDGs.</p><p>The draft agri-food strategy to 2030, drawn up by a stakeholder committee, has been published as part of a public consultation on its environmental assessment, and is open for submissions until 15th June.

These figures, of course, must be treated as an estimate of how output will break down across the licensing categories.</p><p>Our progress to date measured against these targets is set out below:</p><p>- Roads: the Department has already issued forest road licences for 100km so far this year which is 80% of the target of 125km set out in the Climate Action Plan 2019.  It is, therefore, expected that the road licences issued for the remainder of the year will exceed this target.</p><p>- Regarding afforestation, based on the above estimate,  we would expect to issue licences for over 5,000 new hectares. This allied to the 4,300 hectares already licensed and ready for use will give the sector sufficient volume to help meet the 8,000 ha target.  It is up to landowners to decide to plant, once they have received approval to do so, but arranging financial approval is a straightforward process completed by their registered forester, before proceeding to plant. It is a matter for all stakeholders to utilise the licences available and I would encourage all stakeholders to do so.</p><p>- Felling: We have issued just over 2million m3 year to date. I am confident that last year's output of 5million m3 can be exceeded and therefore the COFORD sectoral target for the year will also be exceeded.</p><p>In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has responsibility for forestry, has established Project Woodland, to work with stakeholders to examine all aspects of forestry, including developing a plan to reduce the backlog and undertaking an end to end review of licensing processes.</p><p>I remain hopeful that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will address our current difficulties and will result in a licensing system which meets the needs of forest owners and new applicants  and delivers on identified targets.</p></reply>

Answering the specific questions:</p>  <p>  1. The Commission have instructed that the value of payment entitlements must be calculated with reference to the current entitlement unit value plus greening and therefore the calculation method used here is reflective of that methodology. As the Deputy points out, farmers will be able to apply for the eco-scheme which will be a separate scheme to their BISS payment and entitlement value(s). It is important to note that the direct payments ceiling is a closed fund &ndash; every allocation within that ceiling affects all the other schemes within it.  Therefore, allocating funds to any measure means that the funding for other measures are affected.</p>  <p>  2. There is no mistake in table B in the document and the data in the document is explicitly clear. The current entitlement values will change to reflect the new BISS ceiling that will result after the funds for all other direct payment interventions are allocated (including eco-schemes) starting in 2023, and then will continue on their convergence path to 2026. So, in the example referenced, the initial value in 2023 is &euro;125.27, and this rises through convergence to &euro;160.71 in 2026. As the Deputy has pointed out, a farmer will also be able to apply for support under the eco-scheme measure.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-18a.1855.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051800103#WRHH06400"><p>The gamma interferon test (also referred to as the GIF test or IFN-gamma test) is a valuable tool for detecting TB infection in cattle. It has been widely used as a core part of the TB eradication programme in Ireland since 2015, following many years of it being researched and tested in specific problem herds. </p>  <p>  Like all such tools, it is important to use it in ways which maximise its utility. Each diagnostic test has strengths and weaknesses and the way in which a test is used must take these into account. The key measures of a diagnostic test&rsquo;s accuracy are sensitivity and specificity.  As is the case with diagnostic tests for other diseases, none of the tests currently available for the diagnosis of bovine TB (bTB) allow a perfectly accurate determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle. </p>  <p>  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin skin test (SICCT), often referred to as the skin test, which is used in Ireland is universally regarded as the best screening test in a general population of animals. However, in a group of animals where TB infection is known to be present, the gamma interferon test is used because it can detect infected cattle at an earlier stage of infection than the skin test. Therefore, it can detect a higher proportion of infected cattle; in other words, it has higher sensitivity than the skin test. When used in parallel to the skin test, the gamma interferon blood test can help to resolve TB problems in a herd more quickly by identifying cattle at an early stage of infection before they can spread infection onwards.   </p>  <p>  The gamma interferon test is used as standard in herds which have experienced a significant TB breakdown (for example, five or more reactors, 5% of the herd, or where the investigating veterinary inspector deems it necessary on epidemiological grounds). In addition, the gamma interferon test is used as a quality control measure on SICTT reactors, providing additional confidence in the quality of the skin testing process. </p>  <p>  Under the new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy a new strategy has been deployed whereby the gamma interferon test is used to reduce the risk posed by animals which test inconclusive to the skin test. Other new policies being developed under the TB Eradication Strategy, focussing on herds with chronic or recurrent TB problems, will also use the gamma interferon test as appropriate. </p>  <p>  However, the gamma interferon test is not suitable for use as a general screening test, in the way the SICCT test is used, because it has lower specificity than the skin test. That means the proportion of truly non-infected cattle identified as negative is lower with the gamma interferon test than with the skin test. Using it in herds not thought to be TB-infected would lead to non-infected cattle testing false positive.</p></reply>

The CSP provides an annual co-funding contribution of &euro;19,033 for each fulltime equivalent (FTE) position being supported, and, where warranted, provides &euro;32,000 towards the cost of employing a manager. Qualifying organisations must be social enterprises capable of generating income from their activities in order to meet the full salary costs of the supported posts, for example, from income received from the public use of facilities and services.</p>  <p>  In 2020, Indecon International Economic Consultants were engaged by my Department to carry out an independent review of CSP.  The final report was published in late September 2020 and is available on my Department's website. My Department and Pobal have now commenced work on the restructuring of the Programme.</p>  <p>  Pending the transition to the new restructured Programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the Expression Of Interest process. However, it is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery later in 2021.</p>  <p>  As a first step in that regard, on 28 April, my Department, in collaboration with the Department for Transport, launched a three-year pilot initiative for the provision of high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes for those on low incomes and/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged. Funding of &euro;3m is being provided by the Department of Transport for this initiative over a three-year period and will be made available through my Department's Community Services Programme.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the pilot will support up to 6 social enterprises in 2021. Organisations eligible to apply are those currently supported under the Community Services Programme or, alternatively, are in a Partnership/Consortium of which at least one member is currently a CSP supported organisation. The closing date for receipt of applications is noon on 28 May.</p></reply>

The programme is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.  Its mission is to provide funding to improve facilities available to communities. The funding is allocated to each Local Authority area by a methodology that reflects deprivation levels in each area. </p><p>The Community Services Programme currently supports 420 community organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model. CSP funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of employing staff in these organisations. It meets local service gaps and provides services and facilities that would not be available otherwise.  Some &euro;49million is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2021.</p><p>The Dormant Accounts Fund provides funding for community initiatives and supports, including support for Social Enterprises.</p><p>The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) provides funding for the development of new and existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural areas such as cycleways, walking trails, blueways and mountain access routes. </p><p>CL&Aacute;R is an investment programme for small-scale infrastructural projects in depopulated rural areas. CL&Aacute;R supports the development of identified areas by attracting people to live and work there<b>. </b></p><p>My Department provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their library services. Funding is provided, for example, as a contribution towards the cost of developing library buildings, technological capacity and resources, book-stock and other areas of activity that enhance local library services. Responsibility for the delivery of public library services is generally a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a library authority under the Local Government Act 2001.</p><p>Other funding streams available to communities from my Department.</p><p>The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund was established as part of Project Ireland 2040 and will support a coherent suite of capital investment schemes so that rural towns (with populations of less than 10,000), rural villages and outlying areas can benefit from investment over the coming years. The four headings funded through the Rural Regeneration and Development allocation are (i) RRDF major projects (ii) RRDF Seed Funding (iii) Town and Village Renewal and (iv)the Outdoor Recreational Infrastructure Scheme.</p><p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme<b></b>covers a range of projects to support and rejuvenate rural towns and villages. It is administered by Local Authorities on behalf of my Department and projects are developed in consultation with town/village community and business interests.</p><p>Funding can be provided for a wide range of interventions including public-realm projects, town centre enhancements, encouraging town centre living, and economic development projects. Applications for funding are submitted to DRCD by local authorities. The scheme has an annual budget of &euro;15m, with &euro;25m made available in 2020 due to an additional &euro;10m from the July Stimulus Package.</p><p><b></b>LEADER Programme: Under the LEADER Programme, &euro;250 million in grant aid is available to rural communities and businesses. This is provided to projects focused on economic and enterprise development, job creation, social inclusion and supporting the rural environment. Funding is allocated to 28 sub-regional areas based on administrative or county boundaries.</p><p>All schemes are open to applications from eligible groups during the application timeframes set for each scheme or programme.

For example, as referenced by the Deputy, my Department is providing funding of some &euro;190 million over five years towards the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, which is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a national programme that is delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need. The programme works with both individuals and groups to strengthen communities and improve the quality of life of those facing social exclusion and inequality. </p><p>SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports in the area and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their locality are responded to. The response in each area is and will differ as LDCs support local structures and needs rather than imposing general solutions. Where needed it covers work on the ground with local communities to help build their capacity, help improve the quality of life in these areas and identify opportunities for residents within these communities.</p><p>The current SICAP programme is due to end 31 December 2022. My Department is currently in the planning stages for the next programme which will include a wide stakeholder consultation and co-design process. This will ensure that the stakeholders at the heart of the programme have an input into the design of the new SICAP programme and that the learnings from this programme will feed into the design of the next iteration.</p><p>Separately, my Department is currently developing a Pilot Community Development Programme.<b></b>This involved a recent open call for applications and an assessment process is currently underway.</p><p>It is intended that up to eight projects will be selected promoting an autonomous approach to community work with marginalised communities by affording them the flexibility needed to build relationships with marginalised groups.  Initial funding of &euro;1m for 2021 has been secured, and it is expected that the programme will continue for three years.</p><p>My Department also funds the Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) which provides small grants to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas, including those formerly identified as RAPID areas. The 2021 CEP was launched recently with funding of &euro;4.5m.</p><p>I am hugely conscious of the important support that programmes such as these provide to disadvantaged communities, including those in areas formerly identified as RAPID areas, and I will continue to seek increased funding for all relevant programmes within my Department through the annual budgetary estimates process.</p></reply>

The Dormant Accounts funding was matched by Library Authorities to the value of &euro;83,722 giving a total investment of &euro;733,722. Full details of the initiatives supported are provided in the attached table. </p><p>Among the initiatives providing support for people with physical and learning needs was the Cork City LitBit -  Steps to Literacy and Inclusion programme which provided storytelling sessions for people with mild to profound intellectual disabilities. </p><p>Among the initiatives providing support for those with visual impairments were those delivered in Carlow where daily newspapers were recorded using podcasting equipment and uploaded to the Carlow Libraries website and in Donegal where a programme for visually impaired people was delivered with music and storytelling events. </p><p>In 2020, funding of &euro;713,500 was approved for 104 programmes with &euro;650,000 provided from the 2020 Dormant Accounts Action Plan and &euro;63,500 from the Department&rsquo;s Libraries funding. The funding contained two separate measures &ndash; one for programming and another for digital literacy supports. </p><p>Under the programming measure, 69 projects were approved Dormant Accounts funding of &euro;454,126 which was match funded by &euro;57,209 from Library Authorities. The programmes were diverse in nature and involved participation by a multiplicity of groups including the deaf and blind communities, and people with disabilities and learning needs. Full details are provided in the attached table. </p><p>Under the digital literacy supports element, 34 programmes were approved for Dormant Accounts funding of &euro;180,874, which was match funded by &euro;20,097 from the Library Authorities. This funding supported the delivery of a core element of the national Right to Read programme through the provision of literacy, numeracy and digital skills licences/apps (e.g. Lexia; Touch-Type, Read, Spell; Nessy etc) to assist adults or children with low literacy levels, those with learning difficulties or visually/hearing impaired.</p><p>DAF 2020</p><p>DAF 2019</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;152.73 million was spent within the rural development programme area and &euro;202.51 million within the community development area. The remaining &euro;4.17 million funded the Charities Regulatory Authority.</p><p>Core Funding is provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development for:</p><p>The Scheme to Support National Organisations  : In the Community and Voluntary Sector the Scheme to Support National Organisations is a key element of my Department's support for the role of the sector in contributing to the development of strong and vibrant civil society and in improving outcomes for those most disadvantaged. Funding has been allocated to 74 national community and voluntary organisations to cover the 36 month period of the scheme. </p><p>The Community Services Programme, or CSP  : Over 420 community organisations were assisted with funding through the CSP by my Department during 2020, to provide local services through a social enterprise model. The CSP provides an annual co-funding contribution of &euro;19,033 for each full-time equivalent (FTE) position being supported, and, where warranted, provides &euro;32,000 towards the cost of employing a manager. In response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a CSP Support Fund during 2020 totalling &euro;4.75m which assisted CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provided assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period, up to April 2021. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Supports &amp;amp; Programmesprovide a cohesive framework of support for the community and voluntary sector. The programme supports: 22 volunteer centres nationwide, Volunteer Information Services (VISs) in areas not served by a volunteer centre and a number of national volunteer-supporting organisations - Volunteer Ireland, Young Social Innovators, and Boardmatch.</p><p>The breakdown of core funding allocated to NGOs for 2020 under these programmes and other NGOs funded are listed in the appendix. It&rsquo;s not possible, within the timeframe provided, to supply the funding allocations for the full range of years sought by the Deputy.</p><p>31 Public Participation Networks(PPNs) are established nationally, funding of up to &euro;75,700 per annum has been allocated by the Department to each PPN. This funding supports the on- going support and development of the network nationally.</p><p>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) paymentsof &euro;39,168,430 are issued to Local Authorities for onward provision, for programme delivery, to 46 Local Development Companies.</p><p>All schemes are open to applications from eligible groups during the application timeframes set for each scheme or programme.
