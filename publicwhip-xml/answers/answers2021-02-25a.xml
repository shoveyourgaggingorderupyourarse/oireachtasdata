    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-25a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022500052#WRA00500"><p>Retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment remains fundamentally important to our economic model. The Government and IDA Ireland will continue to promote our country abroad, particularly in the face of international competition. Despite unprecedented challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s economy in 2020, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s end of year results for 2020 show that foreign direct investment was resilient even with the impact of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a number of key strengths that continue to make us a highly attractive destination for FDI. These include our highly skilled workers, excellent education system and positive demographics. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations here.   </p>  <p>  I recognise that global competition for new investment is intensifying. IDA Ireland has recently published its new strategy Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. The strategy prioritises regional development, building a sustainable enterprise base, driving productivity and increasing the spill-over effects from FDI to SMEs. </p>  <p>  I am confident that we can build on our strengths and continue to attract the highest quality of investment to all parts of Ireland.</p></reply>

We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the Credit Guarantee Scheme. Changes were made to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the EWSS, increasing the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. We have extended the EWSS to the end of June which will continue to benefit many businesses and employees in the hairdressing  and barbering sectors. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection announced the doubling of the PUP threshold to &euro;960 over an eight-week period. This will help people to restart their businesses when it is safe to do so and allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs.</p>  <p>  We have introduced a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% until the end of 2021 which will benefit the hairdressing sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners' COVID Restrictions Support Scheme offers a temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels by up to &euro;5,000 per week. This will be of benefit to hairdressing businesses and the Government has extended this scheme to the end of June for impacted businesses.  </p>  <p>  We are committed to helping businesses respond to the economic challenges arising from the pandemic with a particular focus on firms that do not qualify for the weekly CRSS grant from the Revenue Commissioners or existing sectoral schemes in areas such as the arts, transport and tourism. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my colleagues to identify practical actions and to monitor supports available to assist businesses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-25a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022500052#WRA01700"><p>I am acutely aware of the difficulties that the necessary ongoing Covid-19 restrictions are putting on businesses right across the country.  The hospitality sector has been one of the industries hardest hit.   </p>  <p>With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme, low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  The hospitality sector can avail of the supports outlined above, in particular the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme.  This scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Department of Finance. The Government has this week decided to extend the EWSS, the CRSS, the PUP and the rates waiver for impacted businesses to the end of June 2021.  </p>  <p>  Recently, I announced a new &euro;60m Scheme, called the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme that is being developed to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes and to help with fixed costs.  </p>  <p>  Businesses will be required to be in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority for their business in order to qualify for CBAS.  The intention behind this provision is that they assist businesses operating from fixed premises to meet some of the ongoing fixed costs of maintaining those premises.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to proposals as to how we can help businesses further. However, our schemes are there to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and to provide basic weekly income support up to maximum of &euro;350 per week. We are not providing compensation for loss of personal income above this level or compensation for loss of profits for any sector.</p></reply>

Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 15 February, 274 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCPs are installed at Streete Parish Park and Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre and Ballycomoyle GAA Club. Further details can be found at . </p><p>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride is connected by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at . </p></reply>

The knock-on implications for our airports have also been severe.</p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis, and Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the Aviation sector. The supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided for &euro;8.5 billion in funding for public services to address the challenges of COVID-19, and extended the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme into 2021. A Recovery Fund is also to be established to stimulate demand and employment and is to be funded to over &euro;3 billion.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. Both of these programmes have been created in line with EU State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s package for aviation also included a proposal for an airport charges rebate scheme, among other schemes, to be taken forward in 2021. A budget of &euro;26 million was earmarked for these schemes, which are subject to the approval of the European Commission. Good progress is being made in this respect and, if approved, these schemes will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we remain committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity, and to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  Government&rsquo;s priority remains to best protect the health and safety of all those living in Ireland.</p></reply>

As a consequence, the service is closed while Level 5 restrictions remain in place. Candidates who have a theory test scheduled up to 5th March will be contacted via email with a rescheduled appointment. </p>  <p>  The service will remain closed until at least the 05 March.  While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses, I am sure you will agree with me that the limiting of the spread of the virus and the safeguarding of public health takes priority. As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p>  <p>  The RSA has advised that it is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints, when services resume. In this regard, the aim is to double capacity over a three-month period. Subject to decisions on future Covid 19 restrictions, this will mean that additional capacity would be made available in April, May and June 2021.</p>  <p>  Given that normal capacity was approx. 25,000 tests per month, this initiative will provide an estimated 75,000 extra test appointments over the three-month period. This would make substantial inroads into numbers waiting over that time period.</p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time. It will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to return to a normal waiting time. Whether in-person services will be able to resume from the 05 March will be dependent on Covid-19 restrictions in place at that time. The position in relation to backlogs will be reviewed again when Level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-25a.108.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022500053#WRB04800"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020 to provide income support to eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme ended on 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). </p>  <p>  The transitional phase of TWSS operated until 3 May 2020 and provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees. The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates up to 85%, to a maximum subsidy payment of &euro;410. The operational phases also included a tapering mechanism that ensured the subsidy payment plus any additional payment by the employer did not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage (ARNWP).  This ARNWP, was calculated using the pay and tax details as reported to Revenue in the employer&rsquo;s payroll submission for each pay date in January and February 2020. </p>  <p>  Under the TWSS, the employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net income for the duration of the scheme. However, there was no legal requirement for an employer to pay an additional gross (top-up) payment that fully or partially made up the difference between the amount provided by the subsidy scheme and the employee&rsquo;s normal wage (ARNWP). The TWSS legislation also required employers to separately identify subsidy payments on employee payslips from any top-up payments made.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that based on payroll submissions received from the person&rsquo;s employer, her ARNWP was calculated at &euro;721.00 per week and the maximum subsidy payable to her under the TWSS was &euro;350.00 per week. According to Revenue records, the person received TWSS payments from 9 April 2020 to 27 August 2020, which were in accordance with her ARNWP and which took account of the various additional top-up payments received from her employer during this time. </p>  <p>  However, Revenue has previously publicly stated that for certain employees where their employer paid net weekly earnings of between &euro;586 and &euro;960 pre-COVID, the full amount of the subsidy due to such employees may not have been paid through the payroll process during the period the TWSS was in operation.  The process of identifying those employees who qualify for an additional subsidy is currently in progress.  Revenue intends to offset any additional amount against an individual&rsquo;s outstanding income tax/Universal Social Charge (USC) due for 2020, or by way of direct refund if the person has no 2020 arrears.  Based on the information available, it would appear that the person concerned may meet the relevant criteria and may be due an additional wage subsidy.  It is hoped that this process will be implemented by the middle of this year when all the relevant data from employers has been reconciled and the required IT systems developments have been completed.  It is not possible to quantify at this point how much additional subsidy amount each person would be entitled to.</p>  <p>  As already indicated, the EWSS replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020. The scheme is an economy-wide enterprise support that operates differently to the TWSS in that it provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers (rather than employees) based on the numbers of eligible employees on the payroll and on the level of weekly gross pay to those employees. The qualifying criteria for subsidy payments require that the employer pays gross weekly wages to the eligible employee of between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462. There is no subsidy payable where the gross weekly wage is less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462. The rates of subsidy payable to employers per employee are &euro;350, &euro;300, &euro;250 and &euro;203, based on the level of gross wages paid. The level of gross wages paid is a matter for the employer and employee to agree. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that taxpayer confidentiality prohibits the disclosure of any information regarding the specific employer&rsquo;s operation of the EWSS.   </p></reply>

At the outset, it should be noted that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or policy conditions attached to insurance products, as this is a commercial matter. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code requires insurers to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers and the integrity of the market. The Central Bank also requires insurers to make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer and not to recklessly, negligently or deliberately mislead a customer as to the real or perceived advantages or disadvantages of any product or service. Furthermore, the Central Bank considers that information regarding an insurance policy excess is relevant, material information and as such that insurers are obliged to disclose this to prospective policyholders.  </p>  <p>  I also understand that a policyholder may choose to pay a voluntary excess on top of an existing policy excess, and that choosing this option may lower the overall premium.  </p>  <p>  In a situation where a customer feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider in this regard, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

However, the responsibility for competition policy rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) which is an independent statutory body that is responsible for the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.</p>  <p>  NatWest has outlined that an orderly phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank from the Irish market is to take place over a number of years. There is no immediate change for customers with full banking services to continue across all channels for existing and new customers. While NatWest has confirmed that it is negotiation with Permanent TSB and other strategic banking counterparties in relation to certain retail and SME assets, liabilities and operations, these negotiations are at an early stage.  </p>  <p>  Ulster Bank&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Irish market must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s codes of conduct. The Central Bank of Ireland has clear requirements that apply when firms cease operations or transfer operations to another entity. Customers must be informed about these decisions and given at least two months&rsquo; notice to move to alternative providers. If their loans are transferred, they must be given full details of the arrangements. Where a loan is sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new owner.</p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated by international standards, with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, the wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new non-bank entities entering or expanding their operations in SME lending, including through loan guarantee schemes such as the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  Indecon&rsquo;s report also noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches across the country, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the provision of financial services is evolving rapidly.  These range from innovations in fintech to new initiatives from credit unions and the likes of An Post that are resulting in the provision of new services and products.</p></reply>

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Non-performing exposures (NPEs) remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the European banking supervisor. In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPEs since the financial crisis mainly through loan by loan restructuring in addition to a number of loan disposals.</p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the level of NPEs in the Irish system remains well above the European average and some time ago the supervisory authority tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. The banks have no choice but to respond.</p>  <p>  You will recall that in 2018 my Department brought forward legislation to ensure that the contractual rights and obligations of a customer are not altered by the sale of a loan and customers will continue to benefit from, and fall under the scope of applicable regulations, whether with their bank or a third party servicing entity. In this regard - the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act ensures that relevant borrowers whose loans are sold are afforded the regulatory protections they had prior to the sale. All of the customer's rights under their existing terms and conditions will remain in place post transfer.</p></reply>

PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP are provided for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). </p>  <p>  For 2021, the mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit, is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands.  In the case of jointly assessed couples, both of whom are receiving the PUP, the joint tax credits and rate bands are adjusted appropriately. Where one spouse returns to work, the personal tax credit of the remaining PUP recipient is not assigned to the working spouse in the usual manner. It is instead allocated to any excess PUP amount over and above the PUP recipient&rsquo;s PAYE tax credit and rate band.</p>  <p>  When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately inform the Department of Social Protection (DSP) who will cease the PUP claim and notify Revenue that the claim has stopped.  Revenue will then adjust the person&rsquo;s tax credits and rate band as appropriate. Any delay in issuing the revised instruction to the employer will delay the employee receiving his or her full tax credit entitlements, so prompt notification by the employee to the DSP is very important.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that both the person in question and his spouse, have had their tax credit and rate band allocations reduced to collect the tax due on their 2021 PUP payments. Revenue has also confirmed that no notification has been received from DSP confirming that the person&rsquo;s PUP claim has stopped, which is impacting on the amount of tax being deducted from his employment. Revenue has also assured me that, generally, there is no delay between receipt of DSP notifications that PUP payments have stopped, and the adjustment of the individual&rsquo;s tax credits. Revenue will make direct contact with the person to advise him on how PUP payments are managed for tax purposes and to ensure that DSP has been notified of his return to work. </p></reply>

The 2018 Act came into effect on 21 January 2019 and expanded the definition of &lsquo;credit servicing&rsquo; in the 2015 Act to also include the following activities:</p>  <p>  - holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement;</p>  <p>  - determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements; and</p>  <p>  - maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank published Authorisation Requirements and Standards (the Standards) in December 2015. These Standards require that Credit Servicing Firms must be able to demonstrate that they are in a position to conduct their affairs in a manner that ensures the best interests of their customers are protected. The Standards were imposed on Credit Servicing Firms as a condition of authorisation and must be complied with on an on-going basis. </p>  <p>  In advance of the 2018 legislation coming into effect on 21 January 2019, the Central Bank published and updated the Standards to reflect the fact that loan owners now fall to be directly regulated. The Standards provide that a Credit Servicing Firms must structure, organise and resource its business to ensure that it is in a position to demonstrate that it can comply with applicable regulatory requirements. This includes ensuring that adequate and effective control of the firm rests in the State, that all firm records are available to the Central Bank, and that the firm is not outsourcing activities to any extent that would impact on its ability to meet all applicable regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>  The Standards also contain additional requirements for Credit Servicing Firms which hold the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement and which engage in associated ownership activities. These requirements include that each Credit Servicing Firms must have effective processes for the development, implementation and oversight of the firm&rsquo;s overall strategy for the management and administration of its portfolios of credit agreements and the maintenance of control over key decisions relating to those portfolios. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision strategy for the credit-servicing sector has a number of elements, including:</p>  <p>  - Detailed data gathering and analysis, including mortgage arrears and repossession data, such as the pattern of arrears in the Irish mortgage market by entity type; mortgage arrears profile; restructuring activity in the Irish market; data on alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) and complaints etc. Additionally, obtaining direct evidence from consumers to provide first-hand information about their experiences in dealing with the credit-servicing sector.</p>  <p>  - Intensified risk and evidenced-based supervision, which includes both on-site and offsite inspections. The Central Bank will continue to assertively supervise credit servicing firms&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA, to ensure that a fair and transparent process is in place for all borrowers, including those whose loans have been sold.</p>  <p>  - Use of its full suite of supervisory powers as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s approach to supervision of the credit-servicing sector is underpinned by an expectation of high standards and a professional and consumer-focused approach to compliance. </p>  <p>  Beneficial owners were excluded from the scope of the 2018 Act as their inclusion could have had an impact on entities like passive securitisation vehicles. Irish and European banks use securitisation as a matter of course to raise funds for on-lending to the real economy, mortgage borrowers and SMEs who need access to credit. This is an important and ongoing aspect of the international financial system and passive securitisation vehicles do not have any implications for consumer protection.</p>  <p>  If securitisation vehicles needed to be authorised and regulated, a number of unintended consequences may arise. For example, such vehicles could find it impossible to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank and therefore could be forced out of the market completely. Alternatively, they would have to take on staff and premises and adopt structures in order to meet these requirements and the costs of this would be factored in the price that buyers would be willing to pay for securitisations thereby reducing the liquidity available to the lenders originating securitisations and increasing costs that are likely to be passed to consumer.</p>  <p>  As of Q3-2020, Retail Credit Firms and Credit Servicing Firms held 14% of all mortgage accounts, representing 120,341 accounts, with &euro;20.9 billion outstanding.</p>  <p>Investment Funds   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of investment funds established in Ireland. There are two categories of investment funds in Ireland: Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITs), and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) which may be sub divided into Retail and Qualifying Investor AIFs depending on the types of investors they will be marketed to. </p>  <p>  Property funds domiciled in Ireland are typically established as Qualifying Investor AIFs. These fall under the Central Bank&rsquo;s AIF Rulebook and are subject to the provisions of the EU&rsquo;s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. A Qualifying Investor AIF must appoint an Alternative Investment Fund Manager who will also be regulated under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.</p>  <p>  Section 110 companies are not subject to Central Bank authorisation. There are a number of conditions which a company must meet in order to be regarded as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;TCA 1997&rdquo;).</p>  <p>  One of those conditions is that the company notifies Revenue of their intention to be a qualifying company by completing a Form S.110 no later than 8 weeks from the date the company commences its business as a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 TCA 1997. As it is a requirement of section 110 TCA 1997, it is appropriate that the Form S.110 be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  However, in addition to the Revenue reporting requirements, under section 18 of the Central Bank Act 1971, all Irish qualifying companies are obliged to report quarterly data to the Central Bank. This is in addition to the reporting obligation which many such companies already have, where they are &ldquo;Financial Vehicle Corporations&rdquo;, to report quarterly data to the Central Bank under Regulation ECB/2013/40. This information is then reported to the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank statistics provide harmonised information on the securitisation market and can also be broken down by country.</p>  <p>  Further information on the reporting requirements of Special Purpose Vehicles and Financial Vehicle Corporations is available at the websites of the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank respectively.</p></reply>

However, the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of almost &euro;2 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;341m granted to over 46,800 employers in respect of over 526,800 employees.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021. </p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.  </p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.   </p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

The scale of the direct supports means that the Irish fiscal response has been at the upper-end of the distribution of advanced economy responses. </p><p>Supports will continue for as long as they are needed. There will be no cliff-edge in their removal.</p><p>However, the domestic tax base is not sufficient to cope with this amount of spending beyond the very short-term. Therefore, once the vaccine rollout has progressed and the economy re-opened, we will need to begin to roll back the once-off and emergency measures that were put in place in order to ensure fiscal sustainability. </p></reply>

For the purpose of prudent budgetary planning, it was also assumed that bilateral trade with the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. Based on these assumptions, my Department projected GDP growth of 1.7 per cent for the year. However, the public health and economic situation has evolved significantly since the Budget forecasts were published. The recent Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK and the earlier than anticipated rollout of vaccines are both positive developments that will improve the economic outlook for this year<b>. </b>On the other hand, the ongoing Level 5 restrictions will likely have a contractionary effect on the economy. </p><p>While the process of rolling out vaccines will undoubtedly take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, Covid related restrictions will gradually be eased and an economic recovery can then take hold. The speed of this recovery will depend on the pace at which we are able to safely re-open the economy and society. In the near-term after Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed, the recovery in the domestic economy should be supported by the release of pent-up demand financed by the unwinding of historically high levels of household savings. By continuing to support household incomes and thereby minimising the potential for longer lasting damage to the labour market, I am optimistic that a sustained economic recovery will take hold. </p><p>Nevertheless, there still remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as it will depend on many factors, including the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out and the time it takes to suppress the current wave of the virus. My Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse these economic and epidemiological developments and will publish updated forecasts as part of the Stability Programme Update in April.  </p></reply>

However, the new agreement still represents a break from the previously existing arrangements; i.e. a permanent shock to our economy.</p>  <p>  Therefore, even with the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy - particularly in the most exposed sectors in comparison to the previous trading relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  Joint research published by my Department and the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) in March 2019 on the macroeconomic implications of Brexit, captured a range of possible future relationships between the EU and the UK. This research included a limited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) scenario (based on a zero-tariffs and zero-quotas goods-only agreement), which is broadly in line with the recently concluded Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p>  <p>  Under this Free Trade Agreement scenario the level of GDP would be around 2 per cent lower over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) and 3 per cent lower over the long-term (i.e. 10 years), compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.</p>  <p>  The Government is also cognisant that while the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will protect Irish exporters from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario, Irish firms will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements.</p>  <p>  However, to prepare our economy for the impact of Brexit, the Government in Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures. When these measures are taken into account, Brexit related expenditure to date is over &euro;1 billion. </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to allocate &euro;1 billion from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve to Ireland is welcome. The 25 per cent share of the fund initially allocated to Ireland reflects the research undertaken by my Department which shows the disproportionate impact of Brexit on Ireland. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the Irish Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples livelihood&rsquo;s to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

Lockdown restrictions saw the Irish economy contract sharply by just over 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in Q2, followed by a recovery of 11 per cent in Q3 as restrictions eased. Ireland&rsquo;s quarterly GDP fall in Q2 was significantly less of a decline than that experienced by many EU Member States.</p>  <p>  The European Commission recently estimated Irish GDP to have grown by 3 per cent in 2020. This compares to an estimated contraction in EU and euro area GDP of -6.3 and almost -7 per cent, respectively, with Ireland the only Member State with positive growth. However, Ireland&rsquo;s GDP has been boosted by a surge in exports of pharmaceuticals, and this masks a very sharp hit to the domestic economy. In contrast, modified domestic demand declined by -6.3 per cent in the first three quarters of last year, figures which are more in line with the impact in other EU countries.</p>  <p>  More recently, the pandemic has tightened its grip on Ireland and this has continued to negatively affect the domestic economy. As of 22 February, approximately 1 million people were in receipt of some category of state income assistance, which is still below the peak of 1.2 million on 5 May 2020. This is by no means out of line with the experience of other European countries. The resurgence in infections since the autumn, along with the emergence of new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus, has seen the reintroduction of additional restrictions across the EU. On the other hand, Ireland and other EU Member States are also likely to see the beginnings of a recovery in the second half of the year as vaccine rollout reaches critical targets. As a result, the European Commission are forecasting both EU and euro area GDP to grow by almost 4 per cent in 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts with the Stability Programme Update in April.</p></reply>

The principal negative impact arises from the trade shock, mitigated somewhat by a positive Foreign Direct Investment impact resulting from a redirection to Ireland of investment from firms looking to relocate within the EU Single Market. Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector is expected to become broader and more diverse as a result of such relocations.</p>  <p>  In the face of Brexit, the Government has been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy by developing and expanding our economic and trade relationships, both with our EU partners and with other overseas markets. The Mission Network abroad, in partnership with the State Agencies, is playing an important role in terms of public and economic diplomacy.</p>  <p>  While we no longer share EU membership with the UK, Ireland continues  to share good, strong and enduring relationships with the other members of the EU27. This was most visibly demonstrated during the EU-UK negotiations on the future relationship, in respect of the Northern Ireland Protocol and work to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland; as well as in the recent publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, where Ireland is set to be the largest recipient, reflecting our close economic and trade relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  We look forward to continuing to work with our EU partners across the full range of policy areas, as well as working with like-minded Member States as we seek to promote Ireland&rsquo;s policy priorities. We will also continue to work closely with our EU partners as we navigate the common opportunities and challenges before us, such as ensuring a shared and even economic recovery as we overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. </p></reply>

However, the new agreement still represents a break from previously existing arrangements, and thus a permanent shock to the Irish economy. Therefore, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards compared to the previous relationship.</p>  <p>  For Irish exporters, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is positive, compared to a no-deal scenario, as it provides for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. However, it is important to note that the agreement does not completely mitigate against trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks and procedures. So, while tariffs and quotas have been avoided for qualifying goods, non-tariff measures or non-tariff barriers represent a change in trading relations and an increased cost to trade.  In addition, disturbances to retail and distribution supply chains could have a direct impact on Irish consumers through reduced competition and higher prices.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place extensive financial supports for sectors over recent years to assist businesses to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of Brexit, including various financial, advisory, and up-skilling supports. The Government has also invested heavily in port infrastructure, as well as working closely with businesses to navigate the new customs arrangements.</p>  <p>  In the weeks since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, a level of trade friction has been evident. Given the phased basis of the new import controls which must be applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. </p></reply>

Since July 2020, Ireland has taken every opportunity to make its position on the BAR known to the European Commission and to demonstrate the impact Brexit has on us, as the most affected Member State.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, the European Commission published its detailed proposal for the BAR, including an allocation key, setting out how the instrument would work and how much should be allocated to each Member State. Under the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, &euro;4 billion of the total &euro;5 billion instrument will be disbursed in 2021 using an allocation method based on the importance of trade in goods and services with the UK and the importance of fisheries in the UK waters. Under the initial &euro;4 billion tranche of funds, Ireland is set to receive approximately &euro;1 billion (&euro;991 million in 2018 prices, or &euro;1052 million when adjusted for inflation). This proposed allocation is significantly higher than any other Member State. Importantly, the instrument takes into account the high level of trade that Ireland has with the UK, as a result of our close geographical location to the UK. Other Member States geographically and economically close to the UK also see this relationship reflected in their proposed allocations. </p>  <p>  The Commission's proposal for the BAR is currently being negotiated at Council level by the Member States and then with the European Parliament. Therefore, the above-described proposal might not be exactly reflected in the final agreement. My Department, along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of the Taoiseach will continue to work hard to ensure that the final BAR outcome reflects the fact that Brexit has a greater impact on Ireland that on any other Member State. </p></reply>

The recent interest in this cryptocurrency, and its meteoric and highly volatile increase in value, may have been fuelled by a combination of factors:</p><p>-  Increased digitalisation and more time spent online &ndash; as a consequence of COVID-19 restrictions on business and personal lifestyles. </p><p>-  Declining cash usage &ndash; the pandemic has boosted not only the use of credit and debit cards, but contactless payments.</p><p>-  Investors<b></b>seeking new avenues, asset classes and transactions to earn financial yields.</p><p>This is not a new phenomenon that has emerged recently.  Indeed, the European Central Bank has been analysing the crypto-asset phenomenon (not only Bitcoin) with a view to identifying and monitoring potential implications for monetary policy and the risks that crypto-assets may pose to the smooth functioning of market infrastructures and payments, as well as for the stability of the Euro financial system as a whole. To that end, it established in 2018 the Internal Crypto-Assets Task Force with a mandate to deepen the analysis of crypto-assets.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2020, the European Commission and the European Central Bank announced that they were pursuing efforts towards ensuring a strong and vibrant European digital finance sector and a well-integrated payments sector to respond to new payment needs in Europe. The Digital Finance package, announced in September 2020, includes a draft regulation proposal for Markets in Crypto Assets. This proposal intends to regulate crypto-assets that may have a &ldquo;payment&rdquo; purpose and adequate supervision and consumer protection measures are included in this regulatory proposal.</p><p>Finally, in January 2021, the ECB and the EU Commission announced that they are collaborating in exploring the possibility of issuing a digital euro, as a complement to cash and payment solutions supplied by the private sector. The project will involve a review at technical level of a broad range of policy, legal and technical questions emerging from a possible introduction of a digital euro. </p></reply>

In February 2020, one Bitcoin could be purchased for $10,000. It is currently priced at c. $47,000, having reached a historical record price of c $57,500 on 21 February 2021. In other words, this represents a change in value of -2% from a few days ago and +465.2% from one year ago. In contrast, the Euro vs USD exchange has moved by little over 0.10% over the same year.</p>  <p>  Assuming that the question as to whether Bitcoin is gradually being recognised as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo; is meant to infer that Bitcoin may be accepted as &ldquo;money&rdquo;, I would like to recap on the three most basic functions of money:</p>  <p>  1. Medium of exchange. Money can be used for buying and selling goods and services. </p>  <p>  2. Unit of account: Money is the common standard for measuring relative worth of goods and service.</p>  <p>  3. Store of value: Money can be saved and used for future purchases with limited risk to its value depreciating</p>  <p>  4. These fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin, as evidenced in recent days and months, make its use and applicability as a trusted means of payment rather unreliable and inadequate. In other words, its volatility makes it hard to be used as a medium of exchange. There are other considerations as to why Bitcoin may not be accepted as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo;. For example, as a means of payment, it is slow when compared to credit card payment transactions or online SEPA payments. VISA for example, can process +1700 transactions per second. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain can process 3,000 transactions every 10 minutes. </p>  <p>  5. Bitcoin has been labelled a currency, a commodity and a new investment asset class. What may be happening is that Bitcoin is gradually being adopted not so much as a &ldquo;currency&rdquo; or means of payment, but as an investment. Buyers of Bitcoin tend to hold on to their purchases with the expectation that this &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;digital commodity&rdquo; will increase in value. This would mean that Bitcoin may be gradually recognised as a commodity, not a currency.</p>  <p>  6. It can be said that Covid-19 has had an effect in the wider acceptance of Bitcoin as a commodity. First, the pandemic has accelerated the move to transacting and living in a digital world: what might have taken 10 years (in technology adoption terms) has been achieved in 10 months. People were forced to drop the use of cash and become proficient in online payments. As people became more comfortable with making financial transactions online, access to cryptocurrencies (not only Bitcoin) have been made more accessible to the public. Bitcoin can be traded 24/7, unlike other traditional stocks. This availability, combined with the allure of its increasing value, may have attracted more investors into Bitcoin. </p>  <p>  7. Its scarcity cannot be ignored, however. The Bitcoin protocol was written with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins. There are already 18,623,718 BTC coins mined, or in circulation. As the reward for mining Bitcoin halves every 210,000 blocks, so does the reward, which makes the current Bitcoin in circulation increase in value. This programmed scarcity is why Bitcoin has been increasingly called &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  8. In fact, there are financial instruments based on Bitcoin available to purchase: exchange-traded funds, commonly known as an ETFs, a type of investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset, such as gold, oil, an index, or a basket of stocks. It is traded on exchanges in the same way as stocks. </p>  <p>  9. This would point to the fact that Bitcoin may be recognised globally more as a commodity than a currency.</p>  <p>  10. Finally, considering the current negative interest rates markets, it is possible that many investors are purchasing Bitcoin as an alternative avenue to earn investment returns. Recently, some financial institutions have publicly announced significant investments in Bitcoin, as a means to diversify the risk of their investment portfolios. While purchases of Bitcoin seem more &ldquo;main stream&rdquo;, its use a payment mechanism (and thus its use as a fiat currency) is rare. </p></reply>

As set out in NAMA&rsquo;s most recent Section 55 Quarterly Report and Accounts, NAMA&rsquo;s assets at 30 September 2020 included i) loans (primarily secured by properties) measured at fair value of &euro;1,039m; and ii) trading properties and investments in equity and properties  of &euro;469m. The majority of properties in NAMA&rsquo;s remaining secured portfolio comprise land and development assets, much of which is intended for residential development by NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers.   </p>  <p>  At acquisition, the properties securing NAMA&rsquo;s loans were valued at &euro;32 billion. From inception up to 30 September 2020, NAMA generated cash of &euro;39.3bn from the disposal of these properties and loans. An additional &euro;6.4bn was generated in non-disposal income, including rental income from secured properties. </p>  <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s expected lifetime contribution to the Exchequer, between the projected surplus of &euro;4 billion and projected total tax payments of &euro;400m, is &euro;4.4 billion. &euro;2 billion of this projected surplus was transferred to the Exchequer last year. </p></reply>

NAMA has been successful in achieving this mandate and has now entered into the final phase of this work. </p>  <p>  In relation to the delivery of residential housing, it is important to note that NAMA does not build houses itself, rather it works with its existing debtors  and receivers to agree development plans, secure/alter planning permission and fund the debtor's delivery of units.  Through these efforts NAMA is helping to increase the value of the security supporting the loans of its debtors and so improving NAMA's ultimate recovery on these loans.</p>  <p>  NAMA has a well-established overriding commercial mandate to recoup the best return for the Irish taxpayer and this has not changed and has been approved by the European Commission, therefore I have no intention utilising NAMA in a manner outside this commercial mandate. However, that does not mean that NAMA does not carry out objectives, such as facilitating the delivery of residential and social housing, which are entirely consistent with its existing purpose and objectives.</p>  <p>  NAMA has an objective of funding or facilitating the delivery of 20,000 residential units, subject to commercial viability, across NAMA-secured residential sites in Ireland. To end 2020, new residential units directly funded or facilitated by NAMA was 12,450 units; and new residential units delivered on land previously secured to NAMA for which NAMA funded planning permission, enabling works, legal or holding costs was 6,550 units.</p>  <p>  Looking at NAMA&rsquo;s residential pipeline at end-2020, 1,500 units were under construction or had funding approved for construction on NAMA-secured sites and 4,900 units had been granted planning permission and planning applications for a further 7,750 units had been lodged or were being prepared.</p>  <p>  Up to end 2020, NAMA had identified 7,094 residential units as potentially suitable for social housing. Demand was confirmed by local authorities for 2,770 units, of which 2,614 (94%) had been delivered or contracted by NAMA for social housing purposes at the end-September 2020. This is in excess of NAMA&rsquo;s social housing delivery target of 2,000.</p>  <p>  Under State aid rules a commitment has been provided to the European Commission that NAMA&rsquo;s operations shall continue for a limited period to the end of December 2025 at the latest and that NAMA shall submit to the Minister for Finance before the end of 2021 a detailed wind-down plan for its ultimate dissolution within this timeframe.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-25a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022500055#WRD03300"><p>I am aware that the general level of lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.  For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in December 2020. </p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income: cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with their lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

The outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks however, with the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in a sharp contraction in economic activity in the spring last year. However, in keeping with the pattern seen in other countries, the economy rebounded over the summer months as restrictions were eased. </p>  <p>  According to the European Commission&rsquo;s winter forecast, Ireland is now expected to be the only country in Europe to record positive GDP growth in 2020. However, we must be cognisant that GDP figures do not provide an accurate representation of domestic economic activity, given the size of our multinational sector. Indeed, the &lsquo;dual-nature&rsquo; of the Irish economy &ndash; characterised by highly productive and mainly foreign-owned MNCs on one side and domestic-SMEs on the other &ndash; has become even more pronounced during the pandemic. Parts of the multinational sector, most notably pharmaceuticals and ICT, have performed strongly throughout the pandemic. In contrast, the hit to the domestic economy has been severe, with domestic-facing sectors, such as hospitality, leisure and education, bearing the brunt of the economic impact. </p>  <p>  The impact of the pandemic on domestic economic activity is most evident in the labour market. The unemployment rate, which peaked at over 30 per cent in April last year, remains elevated and stood at around 25 per cent in January and there are currently over 1 million people in receipt of some form of State income support. While the impact on the labour market has undoubtedly been severe, government supports such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Wage Subsidy Schemes have helped cushion the impact on household incomes. </p>  <p>  With the vaccine programme now underway, there is light at the end of the tunnel. While this process will take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, as the vaccine programme picks up speed and the public health situation improves, these restrictions will gradually be eased and an economic recovery will take hold. In the meantime, as we continue to live with the virus and manage the public health threat posed by Covid-19, it is crucial that we continue to support households and firms and get people back to work as soon as it is safe to do so in order to minimise any potential long-term damage to the labour market, thereby aiding our economic recovery. More broadly, as a small, open and adaptable economy, our resilience and strength comes from being one that remains open to investment and facilitates trade across our borders. This has been proven to be the strength of the Irish economy over decades and is still the case today. </p></reply>

Compliance with relevant customs and other regulatory controls such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are now an integral part of trade with Great Britain. As a result, imports including online purchases from the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) may incur additional charges including Customs duties and VAT.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that VAT is chargeable on all imports from Great Britain that are greater than &euro;22. Customs duty may be chargeable on purchases over &euro;150, depending on the origin of the goods. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has eliminated Customs duties for goods imported from Great Britain where the goods are of UK origin. However, where the goods being imported from the UK are not of UK origin, then these are subject to Customs duties. The customs value on which Customs Duty is calculated is the cost of the goods plus the transport costs (including postage), any insurance fees and any handling charges to deliver the goods to the EU. VAT is calculated on the Customs Value, plus any Customs Duty applicable. </p><p>Consumers should carefully check the billing policy of the website from which they are purchasing to confirm if the price quoted includes VAT and Customs duty. If VAT and Customs duty is not included, then this will have to be paid when the goods are delivered. Carriers/delivery companies may also add their own charges, and these can vary depending on the carrier/delivery company used.  </p><p>Queries relating to the carrier/delivery company charges should be directed to the company who delivered the goods. Queries relating to the calculation of the import charges should be directed to the company that completed the customs formalities which, usually for online or personal shopping, will be the carrier/delivery company.</p><p>Finally, I am advised by Revenue that its website has a useful guide to import taxes for online shopping: .  There are detailed examples which show how the taxes are calculated, guidance on returning items and a section covering, &lsquo;How to claim a refund of Customs Duty and Value-Added Tax (VAT)&rsquo; where the goods have been returned to the seller. Useful information is also available under the &lsquo;Shopping online&rsquo; section of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website at .</p></reply>

As such, each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies and loan underwriting criteria and it will be a matter for each lender to decide how it treats different types of income in the context of considering individual applications for credit and it is not possible or appropriate for me as Minister for Finance to instruct lenders or seek to influence the decisions of lenders in that regard.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, regulated lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Central Bank Consumer Protection Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses credit the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested. </p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It is a basic principle of public procurement that competitive tendering should be used except in justifiably exceptional circumstances. The EU Directives acknowledge that there can be legitimate reasons for awarding contracts without the use of a competitive process, such as extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events or where there is a single supplier to perform the contract. Consequently, a procurement without a competitive process can be compliant with procurement rules.</p><p>Department of Finance Circular 40/2002 places the obligation on Government Departments and Offices to report all contracts above &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) awarded without a competitive process to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) by 31 March of the following year. The C&amp;amp;AG publishes this information in the Appropriation Accounts. These reports are copied to the Office of Government Procurement. </p><p>The justification for using non-competitive procurement is a matter for each contracting authority. Individual Accounting Officers in their 40/2002 returns certify that the appropriate national and EU procedures were followed and that contract prices were fair and reasonable and represented best value for money.  Circular 40/2002 further states that contracts awarded without a competitive process should be subject to an internal review, preferably by the Internal Audit Unit or alternatively by an appropriate senior officer who is not part of the procurement process.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for auditing and reporting on the accounts of Government Departments including procurement. The OGP does not have a regulatory function but supports public bodies by providing procurement solutions, advice, guidance and systems for public bodies, promoting good practice and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.</p><p>The number and value of contracts above &euro;25,000 awarded without a competitive process for 2019 as reported by Government Departments, in accordance with Circular 40/2002,  are set out in the following table. As previously stated, a procurement without a competitive process can be compliant with procurement rules.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Total No. of Contracts 2019</th>       <th>Total Value of Contracts 2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>729 </td>       <td>&euro;192,298,872</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department does not currently hold details for 2020 or 2021.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which sets the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland. This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector.</p>  <p>  Individual Accounting Officers are responsible for ensuring that their public procurement functions are discharged in line with the standard accounting and procurement rules and procedures and that contract prices are fair and reasonable and represent best value for money.</p>  <p>  The OGP has published the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services on its website www.ogp.gov.ie. The Guidelines provide a comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement regulations designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules to deliver best value for money. In addition, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and public bodies to assist and support them in fulfilling their obligations in relation to public procurement.</p>  <p>  With regard to eliminating delays and improved procedures, minimum time limits are set down in the Procurement Regulations for the different stages of a contact award procedure for tenders above EU Thresholds. The Regulations also provide for an accelerated procedure in certain circumstances.  For procurement below the EU Threshold, there are no prescribed time limits. However, sufficient time must be permitted for preparation and submission of responses by suppliers to allow for genuine competition and for SMEs to participate in the tender process. Contracting authorities are asked to consider the complexity of a contract when setting time limits for receipt of tenders. </p></reply>

Nearly &euro;82.4 billion of this has been allocated at a departmental level, with &euro;5.4 billion set aside in reserve to respond to the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19 as required. It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations. This is the case for all public expenditure, including core expenditure as well as additional expenditure allocated as part of the response to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  A range of budgetary reforms have been implemented in the last number of years to improve transparency and accountability around the Budget process and focus attention on achieving value for money.  This includes initiatives such as Performance Budgeting, which seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure and equality budgeting as a way of approaching and understanding the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation.</p>  <p>  These reforms also include publications such as the Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. Further to this, a new three year cycle of spending reviews began last year and my Department will continue to engage with a range of Departments on the Spending Review process to reinforce a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.  </p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.  In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.</p>  <p>  Adopting this approach will ensure stronger dialogue in this House on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.</p></reply>

It is based on predominately new build projects with values in excess of &euro;500,000 across all regions. The Index is therefore a measure of average price increases across differing project types and locations. </p>  <p>  In recent years there as been an elevated level of inflation in the Irish construction sector. In 2019 the construction tender price index surpassed its previous peak from 2007. The index was estimated to have increased by 6.6 percent over 2019. However, the rate of inflation slowed significantly in 2020 to 1.3 percent. This is an issue which is highly uncertain at present due to issues including Brexit and Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Continued monitoring of inflation and capacity constraints by the National Investment Office in conjunction with the Construction Sector Group will be necessary to inform any policy decisions in this area in the future. </p></reply>

A core goal of this Department is to continue to deliver reforms for Government through improved, cost-effective public services across a range of areas including governance, accountability, procurement, shared services, organisational redesign and property management. </p>  <p>  The existing framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020 (OPS2020), builds on earlier reforms, whilst expanding their scope in order to accelerate the digital delivery of public services, deliver better outcomes for citizens, drive innovation and help to develop our people and organisations. </p>  <p>  Notable examples of initiatives that have been delivered include:</p>  <p>- Digital  : transforming and driving digital delivery of services, such as, for example; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Active Mobility Service; passport on-line; the Library Service&rsquo;s My Open Library initiative; the Revenue Commissioners PAYE Modernisation programme</p>  <p>- Innovation:   the Public Service Innovation Strategy, Making Innovation Real, was launched in November 2020 to enable our public services become more effective and efficient for the citizen;   a Public Service Innovation Fund has been established to support innovation projects across the Public Service; the establishment of a central innovation support team; the creation of a Public Service-wide innovation network, and; the implementation of an annual Public Service-wide innovation week, amongst other initiatives  </p>  <p>- Emerging Technology  : driving the take-up of Robotic Process Automation through a dedicated procurement framework, facilitating swift and easy draw down of licences, supports and expertise to create efficiencies in back-office functions</p>  <p>- Strategic Human Resource Management:   a significant review of strategic workforce planning was undertaken in selected public service organisations. A range of support materials to enable greater use of this strategic resource management tool have also been published</p>  <p>- Diversity and Inclusion:   following a consultative process with Civil Society representing people covered by the nine grounds of equality legislation, a range of supports have been developed to  promote greater diversity and inclusion in our Public Service</p>  <p>- Governance:   creation of the Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) - at Secretary General and equivalent level- supported by the Public Service Management Group (PSMG) to oversee the governance of reform efforts.</p>  <p>  Innovations and reforms are also underway outside of the OPS2020 framework in organisations across the Civil and Public Service. For example, in this Department, a number of budgetary reforms have also been introduced in recent years including a renewed Public Spending Code and additional spending reviews. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware public service reform is also at the heart of the new public service pay agreement - Building Momentum 2021/2022.    Under the new Agreement, the parties will be working over the coming weeks to agree action plans to give effect to the reform commitments in the Agreement. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is currently in the process of preparing a successor framework to OPS2020. Similar work is also well-advanced in framing a further renewal plan for the Civil Service, in addition to an examination of the organisational structure and design of our Civil Service.  These agendas will focus on large-scale ambitious transformation to support greater cost-effectiveness through enhanced digital service delivery, the development of our data infrastructure, and by building the workforce and workplace of the future arising from the transformative effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>In terms of meeting annual targets, any forthcoming reform plan will seek to support priorities that have been articulated in the Programme for Government, in addition to other reform priorities that are identified across Government. Reform measures in Government&rsquo;s current and previous reform programmes are programme managed to achieve the required outcomes, with progress tracked against identified indicators. . Copies of progress reports in relation to the existing reform programme are available at www.ops2020.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The current epidemiological situation is such that it does not permit Government consideration at this time of the reopening of golf courses. The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations.</p>  <p>  The Government has this week published the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead and agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5th of April to review the level of restrictions. The focus of the assessment, based on the public health advice, will be on achieving the following before any significant easing of measures is contemplated:</p>  <p>  1. Disease prevalence (case numbers/incidence) is brought to much lower levels that can be managed and controlled by public health and that the reproduction number (&ldquo;R&rdquo; number) is such that we can be confident that we can continue to suppress the disease e.g. at or below 1.</p>  <p>  2. Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care.</p>  <p>  3. Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination.</p>  <p>  4. Emerging information on variants of concern.</p>  <p>  Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing. The Government has agreed that the following areas may be considered if the situation improves sufficiently:</p>  <p>  - Some easing of restrictions on outdoor activities and meetings beyond 1 other household.</p>  <p>  - Consideration of extending the current 5km limit.</p>  <p>  - Staggered start of easing of other areas of activity with a focus on outdoor activities including sport and some areas of construction.</p>  <p>  Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies with a view to bringing proposals at the appropriate time for consideration by Government, in consultation with NPHET and the public health authorities. </p></reply>

In regard to tourism these measures include:</p>  <p>  - The first phase of  the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme was launched on 11th February by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to help strategic tourism business survive the pandemic and drive recovery. The Scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses that are not eligible for CRSS to support their survival.  It will provide an equitable level of payment to the CRSS for qualifying businesses and the first phase will cover businesses such as tourism attractions, activity providers, and caravan and camping sites.</p>  <p>  - The  VAT rate for the Sector was reduced to 9% to help improve competitiveness and viability of businesses. </p>  <p>  - Two  separate funds of &euro;10million each were introduced for Coach Tourism Operators and Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme in the last quarter of 2020.  </p>  <p>  - Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p>  <p>  - A &euro;26m adaptation fund for the tourism sector to adapt their premises  to meet COVID-19 safety requirements. </p>  <p>  - In addition, the Government has introduced a number of horizontal measures that have been of assistance to the tourism sector including the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), tax warehousing, and the Commercial Rates waiver.  In regard to the CRSS, as at 25 February 2021, Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; data shows that &euro;329m was paid out under CRSS, of which approximately 63% (&euro;206m) was in respect of the tourism and hospitality sector.</p>  <p>  The measures introduced have been critical in assisting tourism businesses to survive the hugely challenging situation brought about by the pandemic. Unfortunately, the evolution of the pandemic in Ireland and elsewhere has meant that our tourism sector has remained in survival mode.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 23 February the Government published "COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 The Path Ahead".  The Government also decided to support businesses, including tourism businesses, by extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the current commercial rates waiver for a further three months.</p>  <p>  The Government has also committed to publishing a National Economic Recovery Plan.  As part of the Plan the Government will consider more targeted measures to help re-boot those sectors, such as tourism, who will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.</p></reply>

It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing. The Government has agreed that the following areas may be considered if the situation improves sufficiently:</p>  <p>  - Some easing of restrictions on outdoor activities and meetings beyond 1 other household.</p>  <p>  - Consideration of extending the current 5km limit.</p>  <p>  - Staggered start of easing of other areas of activity with a focus on outdoor activities including sport and some areas of construction.</p>  <p>  Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies with a view to bringing proposals at the appropriate time for consideration by Government, in consultation with NPHET and the public health authorities. </p></reply>

The review concludes that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network which entails:</p>  <p>  1. The cessation of turf-cutting on 36 natural heritage areas, which will remain designated - this includes 7 sites to be divided, with part to be conserved and part de-designated;</p>  <p>  2. The de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas - including the relevant areas of the 7 sites to be divided - where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal and/or restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved. Domestic turf-cutting may continue on these sites; and</p>  <p>  3. The designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure. These sites are to be proposed for designation to make up for the loss of habitat within the natural heritage area sites where domestic turf cutting may continue.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 is to give legislative effect to the outcome of the 2014 Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network. The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il on 13 December 2018. The Bill was passed by the Seanad on 6 November 2019.</p>  <p>  16 amendments to the Bill were made in the Seanad. The Bill has to be restored to the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il in order for these amendments to be considered by that House.</p>  <p>  The site referred to in the Deputy's Question is one of those scheduled for de-designation.</p></reply>

The position remains the same.</p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that could be raised in 2021 is not currently available in my Department. My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their own functional area. A recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas shows there are collectively over 320 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 300 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2020 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2021, unless development works were activated in the interim.</p>  <p>  Based on the information from the recent review of the online registers which showed that there were sites with market valuations of &euro;441.5m listed on local authority registers on 1 January 2020 and were liable to the levy in 2021, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally for 2021 could be of the order of &euro;30.9m based on the application of a site market valuation rate of 7%.</p>  <p>  The levy is not intended to be a revenue generating measure with the proceeds accruing to the relevant local authority rather than the Exchequer.  The levy proceeds generated are specifically intended to be used by local authorities for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their administration costs in collecting the levy.</p></reply>

It will help eligible purchasers to secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home that is suitable to meet their needs.  There is no borrowing requirement beyond that already permitted under the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro-prudential rules.</p>  <p>  Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage, involving detailed consideration of all aspects of the Scheme taking on board feedback and in consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to launch later this year and, once operational, it will target Exchequer resources to simultaneously address the key challenges of affordability and supply. It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks. Depending on the final design, this would allow support for in the region of 1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Affordable Housing Bill, which I published earlier this year, will facilitate affordable housing delivery by local authorities, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency and on the open market. This is a major step forward in providing much needed affordable housing to buy and rent to squeezed middle income earners in Ireland.  </p></reply>

The Green Committee oversaw the preparation of a detailed Action Plan that lists almost 60 sustainability measures under six separate headings that the Department began implementing in late 2019.</p><p>Among the Department&rsquo;s undertakings is to invest across the Mission network in cost-effective sustainability upgrades such as solar panels, additional insulation, thermal glazing, LED lighting and other appropriate energy-efficiency infrastructure. In 2020, solar energy technology was installed at premises owned by the Irish State in Dar-es-Salaam, Lilongwe and Mexico City. In the case of Lilongwe, for example, the project has almost completely removed the need to use the diesel-powered back-up generator that the Embassy had relied on during regular local power outages. Further solar energy projects will be undertaken in future years, including this year at premises also owned by the State in The Hague and Lusaka.  Details of costs to date are provided in table 1 below.</p><p>The Department purchases motor vehicles in order to facilitate the functioning and operations of its HQ units and Missions. It is committed to procuring vehicles with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life-cycle. Under the Department&rsquo;s official vehicle management policy, and in line with our Green Foreign Ministry initiative, vehicle purchases must comply with the Department&rsquo;s policy of minimising its carbon footprint. Factors such as pollutant emissions, fuel efficiency and noise levels are taken into account in our vehicle specifications, which therefore favour electric and hybrid vehicles. However, it should be noted that some our Missions operate in difficult environments, where security and health and safety can be deciding factors. Details of vehicle purchases and costs in 2020 are provided in table 2 below.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; solar energy systems installed in 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Location</th>       <th>Premises</th>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Cost in Euro </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dar-es-Salaam</td>       <td>Chancery</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>56,650</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lilongwe</td>       <td>Official Residence plus a mobile unit for a rented premises</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>42,203</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mexico</td>       <td>Official Residence</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>9,502</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; vehicle purchases in 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Mission </th>       <th>Type</th>       <th>Make &amp;amp; Model</th>       <th>Costs in euro<br /><br />(precise net costs to be finalised in some cases)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Berlin</td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Mercedes E300e</td>       <td>19,317</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Los Angeles </td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Lexus NX300H </td>       <td>38,078</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Austin</td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Toyota Highlander H</td>       <td>40,738</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jordan</td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Toyota Corolla </td>       <td>18,995</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jakarta </td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Toyota CHR</td>       <td>25,674</td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Brasilia </th>       <th>Hybrid</th>       <th>BMW X3 3e</th>       <th>35,432</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Abu Dhabi</td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>Lexus ES300H </td>       <td>39,090</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Berne </td>       <td>Hybrid</td>       <td>BMW 530e</td>       <td>34,438</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Our Embassy in Ankara has been closely monitoring the situation and is collaborating closely with other EU and like-minded Embassies, including in monitoring the ongoing trial of other LGTBQ+ students arrested for seeking to organise a pride parade in 2019. The branding of the student protesters as &lsquo;terrorists&rsquo; and the arrests of over 500 students and protesters for exercising their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly is unacceptable.  Turkey needs to respect its national and international obligations and to release all of those arbitrarily detained for exercising their right to peaceful assembly over the past few weeks. </p>  <p>  I equally condemn the rhetoric of senior Turkish officials against LGBTQI+ groups and the closing down of Bogazi&ccedil;i University&rsquo;s LGBTQI+ Association. This is unfortunately part of a wider pattern in Turkey, with LGBTQI+ NGOs facing restrictions on their freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, as well as facing smear campaigns and hate speech from senior officials. </p>  <p>  The actions against the students and the targeting of LGBTQI+ groups also run counter to Turkey&rsquo;s stated commitment of pursuing a closer relationship with the EU. The EU is built on adherence to fundamental values, including defence of human rights, freedom of expression, and strict respect for the rule of law. For any meaningful progress on Turkey&rsquo;s relationship with the EU to occur, Turkey needs to change course and show sustained commitment to the rule of law.</p>  <p>  Ireland ascribes the greatest importance to the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and advancing human rights is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. We are committed to promoting the rights of LGBTQI+ people, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination around the world. Ireland continues to support initiatives in the EU and other international fora which promote and protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people, and which condemn violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. </p></reply>

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, we are concerned by ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders.</p>  <p>  I note with concern reports regarding the recent arrest and detention of children in Bahrain. Bahrain has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of child prisoners and detainees as set out in Articles 9 and 14 of the ICCPR and Articles 37 and 40 CRC. For example, Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that &ldquo;The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland has raised the human rights issues in Bahrain at the Human Rights Council in the form of national statements and through support to EU Statements.</p>  <p>  Ireland also engages on the issue of human rights in Bahrain through the European Union, including through the EU Delegation in Riyadh which is accredited to Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. </p></reply>

The MSPC owes its origins to the decision of the Oireachtas of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann in June 1923 to recognise and compensate wounded members, and the widows, children and dependents of deceased members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, including the National Forces, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Republican Army and the Irish Citizen Army through the payment of allowances and gratuities.  Over time, provision was enhanced and broadened to include members of the Hibernian Rifles, Cumann na mBan, Fianna &Eacute;ireann and certain members of the Connaught Rangers.  Two streams of legislation are relevant to the material in the collection:</p>  <p>  - The Army Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1953</p>  <p>  - The Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949. </p>  <p>  The MSPC project is mandated to preserve and make available the files and records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of qualifying members of these organisations from the period April 1916 to the 30th of September 1923. This involves cataloguing and digitising in excess of 275,000 files </p>  <p>  Public release of material from the collection is made available online through the Military Archives website www.militaryarchives.ie.  To date there have been nine online releases of material, the most recent release was in October 2020.  Since its first release of material, over 100,000 files have been processed with approximately 40,000 files scanned.  Over 2 million individual pages have been digitised since the commencement of the project. </p>  <p>  The latest release of material, along with previous releases, provides an invaluable source of information that continues to greatly facilitate research around this defining period in Irish history, and captures first-hand accounts of individuals that participated in events of that period. </p>  <p>  The digitisation of the file, which is performed for both preservation and for access, is only one small aspect of the process in making files available to the public.  In order to follow international standards for archival cataloguing and before a file is scanned it must be examined physically, repaired and cleaned. Information is also extracted for database retrieval online and any GDPR issues are examined. The file may then need to be flattened to ensure that it is safe to be handled for scanning. It is only after this process has been completed that the file may be scanned. Each scanned file is then linked to its archival description and following this process, files are ready to be released online. </p>  <p>  For files held in the Military Services Pension Collection, on average one single claimant may have 3 files under their name.  In addition, and to note, files can vary in size from a couple of pages up to several hundred pages.  To date, the project team have scanned the files of circa 15,000 applicants, which represent around 40,000 files.  It is estimated that the collection encompasses the claims of approx 80,000 applicants.  There has been a focus on prioritising the digitisation of files of successful claimants which generally are larger in size than files of unsuccessful claimants and therefore take longer to process.  </p>  <p>  The aim of the Military Services Pensions Collection project during 2021 is to continue to make additional files available through planned releases, adding to the substantial corpus of digitised primary sources already available online. </p></reply>

Single-Living-In accommodation is provided for operational and transient use.  As such, military personnel can use accommodation for overnight stays during operations, training and courses. The occupancy of SLI accommodation therefore can fluctuate on a daily basis, depending on location, activities and the number of courses being held in a location and the duration of the course.</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year. </p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. </p>  <p>  These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. </p>  <p>  In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p>  <p>  It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p>  <p>  An allowance has been made for 2nd year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2nd year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4weeks). 2nd year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2nd year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work. </p>  <p>  The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p>  <p>  In relation to other grant schemes, this is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. </p></reply>

This remains unchanged. </p>  <p>  While many SNAs have qualifications above the entry requirement, there are no plans to change the qualifications required for appointment.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) was published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs. While SNAs are very much valued in the provision of care support, the Review recommended that a more broadly based set of supports was required including therapeutic supports.  </p>  <p>  The Review also referenced SNA training. Among the recommendations was the introduction of a national training programme for SNAs currently employed in our schools. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. </p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the</p>  <p>  theory and research based best practice underlying their role. Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education.  </p>  <p>  There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools.

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p><p>There are currently 3 special classes providing placements for students in the wider Greystones area at Post Primary level. The school referred to by the Deputy has received sanction for 2 special classes over the next two school years, with 6 students in each class. I can assure the Deputy that where schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places. </p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p><p>NCSE has advised that they are aware of an identified need for additional special classes in the Bray/Greystones area. I also understand NCSE is in ongoing consultation with post primary schools in the area with a view to establishing additional special classes in this and in the North Wicklow area generally to meet the identified need.</p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: .  Information on the list of schools with special classes is available at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, if rigorously adhered to, will keep the school community safe during this period.

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  My Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within the particular area and its ability to meet increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and work on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years, including those which may arise in the Waterford school planning areas, is at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  A separate patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies, including Educate Together, and prospective patrons.  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.  </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Well-being Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting well-being in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of well-being and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the well-being, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS also provides training to schools in programmes to reduce anxiety and promote coping and resilience in children and young people. </p>  <p>  The curriculum also plays an important role in teaching students about managing their well-being. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Well-being. Well-being crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; well-being. When planning a Well-being Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. In particular the SPHE short course Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Well-being is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the schools Junior Cycle programme.  </p>  <p>  Well-being is mandatory in all primary schools as part of the SPHE curriculum. At primary level the SPHE curriculum is designed to foster children&rsquo;s well-being, self-confidence and sense of belonging develops children&rsquo;s sense of personal responsibility for their own behaviour and actions. It promotes children&rsquo;s self-awareness and understanding by helping them to manage their own feelings, to recognise and appreciate individual abilities, and to cope with change of various kinds as well as supporting children to become active and responsible citizens.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each school, at local level to arrive at its own homework policy. In keeping with good practice, the process of drafting a homework policy, should involve consultation with teachers, parents and students</p>  <p>  Although schools are not obliged to have a published policy on homework the Department does acknowledge that homework can play an important part in helping pupils prepare for forthcoming class work and in reinforcing work already covered during class time.</p>  <p>  During this period of teaching and learning remotely, teachers should ensure that pupils are given opportunities to make real progress in developing their knowledge, skills and understanding across the curriculum. Guidance from the Department states that it is important that all teachers provide specific teaching input to their pupils to support them as they continue their learning engagement from home, this will vary between the work that the teacher will ask pupils to do independently and direct teaching by the teacher. </p>  <p>  Where there is less frequent engagement throughout the week, perhaps due to broadband issues, a clear daily and manageable allocation of work should be provided for pupils. In all cases, engagement with pupils should ensure that direct instruction is provided using a variety of approaches including video, audio, presentation software and written instructions. There should be a balance of guided and independent learning tasks assigned across the curriculum and teachers should ensure that the learning tasks chosen give pupils an opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a clear and concise manner.</p>  <p>  In relation to research on homework, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in consultation with the National Parents Council, commissioned some research in 2018 on Parental Involvement, Engagement and Partnership in their Children&rsquo;s Education during the Primary School Years and Homework was a significant theme in this work. This research was published in 2019 and is available on the NCCA website www.mie.ie/en/research/parental_involvement_engagement_and_partnership_in_their_children%E2%80%99s_education_during_the_primary_school_years/.</p>  <p>  In relation to homework the research asked how is homework designed to promote a partnership between school, child and parents? In this regard, it found that parental and teacher views on the role of homework in a child&rsquo;s education differ greatly; homework is found to be a source of stress for parents, regardless of their child&rsquo;s academic ability; many parents are concerned about the amount of homework that is received ; while a key purpose of homework is understood as supporting parental involvement in learning, the fact that it is described as a stressful experience does not support positive involvement in children&rsquo;s learning; and that choice&rsquo; emerged as particularly important for children, in choosing what homework, when and how to undertake it.</p>  <p>  In terms of recommendations related to homework, the following are detailed:</p>  <p>  -  Additional opportunities could be provided for parents and teachers to discuss how to support children&rsquo;s language development in the home. This could begin with a conversation about homework</p>  <p>  -  Although there is evidence of good homework practice in schools, there is a need for national guidance on homework in relation to time, content and method that suits children best, according to research in the field</p>  <p>  -  Schools need to review homework policies and to ensure a whole-school approach is applied in relation to homework</p>  <p>  -  Entertaining and interactive oral language games and activities should be incorporated into children&rsquo;s homework</p>  <p>  -  In planning homework, schools might take into consideration the demands on children's time to do planned activities outside of school and the importance of outdoor free play opportunities for young children</p>  <p>  -  Schools might consider removing homework from junior infant classes with the exception of story-time/reading to/with children.</p></reply>

Measures include all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are also in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible which reduces interaction on school transport services. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of services and the geographic location of the children travelling to schools throughout the country it is not logistically possible to provide separate services for each school.  As schools return on a phased basis, transport services are fully operational with continued additional hygiene and other measures that were introduced on school transport services at the start of the school year. All services for children attending special schools and special classes are now fully operational with these additional measures in place.  </p>  <p>  Public health guidelines are being implemented on the SEN transport scheme, however where parents would prefer not to use the service during this interim period, the Department will make temporary grants available for transport until schools reopen fully. </p></reply>

Currently 107 credit unions at some 281 locations are participating in the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  An Post facilitates the repayment of these loans for social welfare recipients who receive their payment through a Post Office, by utilising the Department of Social Protection's Household Budgeting Facility. As part of a pilot scheme since Q1 2020, the Department has funded the weekly administrative cost for access to the Household Budgeting Facility. </p>  <p>  The Department does not have access to the overall number of It Makes Sense loans. Data from the Household Budgeting Facility is a proxy indicator, although the overall number of borrowers is likely to be greater given that some borrowers repay these loans by direct debit, while others qualify for and receive standard loans.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 990,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel to include those with long-term health conditions such as epilepsy, who are not allowed to drive due to their diagnosis, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, would have significant implications for the free travel scheme.  It would be expected that any such decision would immediately lead to calls for all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues to be eligible for a free travel pass.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

These services are engaged to supplement the provision of employment services to those most distant from the labour market.</p>  <p>  This year, the company in question is one of 22 different contractors providing Local Employment Services (LES) in a network of offices and outreach clinics in designated areas to provide career/vocational guidance and support to job seeking clients. The value of this contract this year is almost &euro;967,000 to that LES.  In addition, the company is also one of 37 contractors who provides Job Club services to clients in its local catchment to assist job-ready jobseekers to obtain employment in the open labour market, to facilitate the exploration and follow-up of employment opportunities as well as meeting the labour market requirements of employers.  The company provides this service locally to nearly 700 clients at a value of over &euro;100,000 this year. </p>  <p>  The new proposal is seeking significant additional funds towards the development of simulated IT work experience for unemployed young people.  While 60% of the costs are being met by a private company as part of their commitment to corporate social responsibility, significant additional funding is being requested from this Department for a programme which will last 30 months.   While the Department is appreciative of the innovation involved, there is no scope to fund this programme at this stage at the level requested.  </p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in a range of new measures under the July Jobs Stimulus.  This encompasses a commitment of &euro;200m investment in training, education, skill development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies and jobs search and assistance measures aimed to help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.  </p>  <p>  Included in this is provision of &euro;135.7m for a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months, regardless of age. A particular objective is to provide a mechanism for those with recent work experience or with sector specific skills to pivot into new employment/jobs through additional learning with new and relevant work experience.  </p>  <p>  The Department would be willing to consider whether there are options for the retention of jobseekers payments for the 20 weeks of the programme under the Education, Training and Development Option for short duration training.  However, more information on the proposal will be required and even if approved, it will not cover all the costs being sought from this Department.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department does, however, provide funding to mainstream pre-school services, including through the universal, free, two-year Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM). </p>  <p>  AIM is a programme of supports to enable children with a disability to access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme. It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted. AIM supports are available through all mainstream pre-school settings that are funded through the ECCE Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the supports provided through AIM in mainstream settings, pre-school services are also offered in a limited number of specialist pre-schools and early intervention classes which cater exclusively for children with disabilities, which fall within the remit of the HSE or the Department of Education.</p>  <p>  The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. The levels of support are:</p>  <p>- Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.</p>  <p>- Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County/City Childcare Committees. </p>  <p>- Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).</p>  <p>- Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early years education (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>- Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early years settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service.</p>  <p>- Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable the child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE Programme. </p>  <p>- Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room   involves additional capitation for service  providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff / child ratio, supporting the Pre-School Leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p>  <p>  Local County Childcare Committees (CCC) help provide information on pre-school settings in their locality that may have capacity for children, including those with physical and intellectual disabilities, to attend.

Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and such education activities cannot be held remotely.

Local assessment will focus on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means, and are time-critical for students and learners during this period. Reflecting the scale and diversity of third-level provision, further and higher education institutions are best equipped to determine where onsite presence is required.</p></reply>

At this point I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review to indicate when any proposed changes will come into effect. </p>  <p>  Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student. </p>  <p>  Students on graduate entry medicine courses may be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding.</p></reply>

That is reflected in the Programme for Government itself and in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform which was launched last December. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan sets out 66 actions designed to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations. The Action Plan includes actions to be taken by my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The implementation of the Action Plan is being overseen by the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of personal injuries guidelines, the Deputy will be aware that the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  Last October, the Government amended the Judicial Council Act 2019, to ensure that the personal injuries guidelines would be adopted and published by, at the latest, 31 July 2021, three months earlier than originally required under the Act.  Draft Guidelines were furnished to the Board of the Judicial Council last December and I understand that they are currently under consideration.  I should add that, under the Judicial Council Act 2019, the Council is independent in the performance of its functions and I do not have a role in its operation or that of its committees.</p>  <p>  In addition to the adoption and publication of the personal injury guidelines, my Department is developing proposals in relation to:</p>  <p>  - the Occupiers' Liability Act 2005,</p>  <p>  - the discount rate applied to awards in cases of catastrophic injury, and</p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission Report on the Capping Damages in Personal Injury Actions.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the final draft of the Garda Reserve Strategy is currently being reviewed within the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to further note that in its latest report on policing during the COVID-19 pandemic, published on 23 February 2021, the Policing Authority noted that the Garda Commissioner is now seeking to use the Garda Reserve to leverage the maximum capacity of the organisation. The extended utilisation of the Garda Reserve is a positive step, which the Authority has welcomed.</p></reply>

However, a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 15 months. A High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, resulted in significant delays. </p>  <p>  As well as this, a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in-person ceremonies during Covid-19 and the restrictions on staff attending the office. The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time. As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months. </p>  <p>  In order to help in dealing with the backlog, and in particular those applicants that were ceremony ready, I was pleased to announce last month that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty to the State. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and the Citizenship Division will communicate directly with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence. As of this week, 2,000 applicants have been communicated with, of whom 900 have reverted and 600 certificates of naturalisation have issued. Its intended that in total 4,000 applicants will be communicated with by the end of March.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to continuing to fund Abhaile, and to introducing the necessary reforms to our personal insolvency legislation to ensure that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties. This also reflects the Government&rsquo;s ongoing prioritisation of more vulnerable citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the period of national recovery which will follow. There is, in addition,  a commitment to reviewing the scheme this year.</p><p>An important component of Abhaile relates to the provision of legal aid for proceedings under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended). This legislation provides for a process where a proposal for personal insolvency arrangement can be implemented by a court even if rejected by creditors at a creditors meeting.  </p><p>The legal aid available includes the services of a solicitor from the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Abhaile Solicitors&rsquo; Panel and payment to the personal insolvency practitioner with respect to the expenses they occur in making the section 115A application. Prior to 1 March 2019, the services of Junior Counsel were funded in all s115A applications. Since that date the services of Counsel may be sought on a case-by-case basis as is the case in other civil legal aid matters. </p><p>These Panels and supports are administered independently by the Legal Aid Board under the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions. They are also subject to statutory audit and certification by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and subject to the relevant Internal Audit and corporate governance procedures. The following information has been provided in the form of three Schedules by the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>Schedule A sets out the amounts spent by the Legal Aid Board on solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 during the year 2020. </p><p>Schedule B sets out the amount paid by the Legal Aid Board to each individual solicitor, barrister and personal insolvency practitioner for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 during the year 2020. </p><p>Schedule C sets out the total amounts incurred but not yet paid by the Legal Aid Board in connection with solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 as at 1 January 2021, and the amount of those liabilities which were accrued during 2020. It is assumed that the accrued fee will be invoiced in full.</p><p>I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board and am informed that the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide information as to individual amounts accrued into the future by individual service providers. This is because the legal aid recipients concerned engage their own solicitor from the panel on foot of a legal aid certificate and it is for that solicitor (if authorised to do so) to instruct Counsel.  The Legal Aid Board does not therefore become aware of which solicitor and barrister has been so engaged until the relevant claim is later submitted to it for that purpose. </p><p>Schedule A</p><p>Fees actually paid (inc VAT) to personal insolvency practitioners, solicitors, and barristers in respect of legally aided applications under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended) <table>    <tr>       <th>Financial Year</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to barristers </td>       <td>&euro;194,881 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to personal insolvency   practitioners</td>       <td>&euro;890,239 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fees to solicitors </td>       <td>&euro;1,700,176 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>&euro;2,785,296 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Schedule B</p><p>Part 1 &ndash; Fees paid to solicitors <table>    <tr>       <th>Payee</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Anthony Joyce &amp;amp; Co </td>       <td>&euro;282,817 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Catherine Allison &amp;amp; Co </td>       <td>&euro;269,881 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Elizabeth Howard &amp;amp; Co Solicitors </td>       <td>&euro;250,055 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hanlon &amp;amp; Company Solicitors </td>       <td>&euro;179,400 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ashtown Gate Solicitors </td>       <td>&euro;179,174 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Alan McGee &amp;amp; Co Solicitors </td>       <td>&euro;139,427 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louisa C.

I understand that the current interest in catalytic converter theft may be directly associated with the current high price of palladium available on the market. </p><p>The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for offences of theft, the handling of stolen property and the possession of stolen property. The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of scrap metal and catalytic converters. A maximum sentence of 10 years in prison is provided for in the case of convictions for offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison is provided for convictions for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p><p>Irish law relating to the sale and purchase of scrap metal is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and arises under the Waste Management Act 1996. The Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 apply to the sale and purchase of scrap metals and were designed to improve the traceability of such scrap metal sales. The regulations impose an obligation on businesses to apply due diligence measures to ensure the traceability of any waste purchased. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a search of the PULSE database was conducted on the 23 February 2021 for records associated with incidents of theft or attempted theft of catalytic converters.  </p><p>Based on numbers returned, the table below which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of arrests which occurred during the period 2019,  2020 and to date in 2021. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service does not typically report on details where there are less than 10 incidents in a given period.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>at 23 February 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Count of Arrests</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>* Less than 10 arrests to date in 2021.</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Please note that the incident data is based upon operational data from the PULSE system and is liable to change.</p><p>I am informed by the Courts Service that it is not be possible to run a query specifically relating to convictions for theft of catalytic converters as offences may have been prosecuted under Theft and Fraud Offences Act  which relates to general theft. Furthermore, some offences could have been prosecuted using uncoded free text code. </p></reply>

The programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.</p><p>Successful applicants under the IIP and their nominated family members may be granted a residence permission in Ireland under Stamp 4 conditions. Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland. Therefore, given the significant immigration benefits accruing it is essential that all applications are subject to a robust due diligence process in respect of both personal and financial checks to protect the State's interests. In this regard, a number of enhanced control mechanisms have been introduced to the Programme within the past 12 months. </p><p>The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years. Following a tender process, a contract to carry out an external review was signed in June 2019. This review was to be carried out in two phases. The Terms of Reference for the review are published on the Immigration Service website at: <i></i>. </p><p>The second phase of the review has recently been completed and is being considered by my Department.

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p><p>On 23<sup></sup>February, 2021, the Government published COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead which sets out how in-school education and childcare services will be reinstated in a phased manner from 1 March, with staggered return throughout March to be concluded after the Easter break on 12 April. Information on the revised plan is available here &ndash; </p><p>At Level 5, 6 guests may attend the wedding  and wedding ceremony irrespective of venue.  This does not include the persons getting married or persons attending in a professional capacity.  The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  Under the current public health measures in place for Covid-19 live music is not permitted at weddings. </p><p>It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET),  by my Department and by the Government. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Details of the public health measures currently in place for weddings can be found at:- </p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - </p></reply>

Over the last number of months, my Department and the HSE have, in close collaboration, developed numerous public health information campaigns that covering these behaviours in depth, for radio, TV, digital and print media. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Department of Health has held press briefings from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure that experts in public health are to the fore when informing the public about the disease&rsquo;s pattern and progression within Ireland and the restrictions required at any given time to prevent the spread of the disease. This gives journalists from a broad cross section of the media the opportunity to ask key figures such as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer questions on a regular and consistent basis, in order to counter the potential spread of misinformation. </p>  <p>  In a media relations sense, representatives of the NPHET are also regularly available for media interview across all major media outlets such as RTE, Newstalk and Virgin Media News, to answer questions and provide responses to any concerns posed to them by media or the general public in relation to the pandemic and Ireland&rsquo;s response to it.</p>  <p>  In terms of online resources, each daily press release issued by the Department of Health, specific links are provided to the COVID-19 dashboard, where detailed information on the spread of COVID-19 and key indicators in the community are available. This includes information such as the number of hospitalisations, ICU figures, tests carried out, and information on case numbers given at LEA level. </p>  <p>  Consistently, the Department of Health has directed followers on social media to official sources of information, such as the Government website, the COVID-19 Data Hub and the HSE&rsquo;s website. The HSE also undertakes considerable social media advertising campaigns in order to promote public health guidelines and advice across platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. </p>  <p>  All of this work is supported by regular opinion polling carried out by Am&aacute;rach. This is published weekly on my Department&rsquo;s website and shows the commitment to assessing how the general public are feeling, not only about the COVID-19 measures, but on a range of issues related to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Underpinning all of the above activity (in terms of advertising, media relations, digital communications, research and online resources) is the consistent yellow look and feel of the Department of Health and HSE public health advice. The distinctive yellow posters and public health logos were a strategic choice. This branding has become synonymous with trusted public health advice and has been consistently used across all of the above crucial communications work. </p></reply>

Minimum benefit is one of the four key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, provided for under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly underinsure. In the absence of the Regulations there is a risk that consumers could be sold policies that do not provide a sufficiently comprehensive level of cover.</p>  <p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women. By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).</p>  <p>  The health services and procedures provided by minimum benefit should be viewed as a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population, and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

Minimum benefit is one of the four key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, provided for under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly underinsure. In the absence of the Regulations there is a risk that consumers could be sold policies that do not provide a sufficiently comprehensive level of cover.</p>  <p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women. By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).</p>  <p>  The health services and procedures provided by minimum benefit should be viewed as a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population, and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

Clinical placement learning makes up 50% of these programmes. Placements, where students are immersed in the care environments, enables students to develop the practical knowledge, clinical skills and professional behaviours required to qualify and be eligible to join the professional register. Supernumerary clinical student placements ensure learning takes place on the front line and that the experience is gained under the supervision of a registered nurse or midwife. I want to protect their status as students and protect their graduate programme which has delivered so many benefits.</p>  <p>  When the pandemic was declared in March 2020 our healthcare system had to re-configure quickly. This resulted in many staff being redeployed, including some staff required for the supervision and support of students in the clinical setting. Following redeployment, the student support infrastructure was impacted significantly and all clinical placements were suspended by the HSE on 10 April 2020. Redeployment, sick leave and COVID 19 related absence also led to a workforce crisis at that time.  One measure used in responding to the workforce demand at the time was that student nurses and midwifes were offered a 3-month contract as Healthcare Assistants (HCAs). This initiative was on a voluntary basis and 1,200 (approx. 30%) took up a contract.  As we moved into 2021 the HSE, despite the continuing challenges associated with the pandemic, was in a much stronger position in terms of staffing.  The HSE hired an additional 1,158 Health Care Assistants in 2020 as well as 1,712 Nurses and Midwives to respond to the additional challenges faced on the front line. At the end of the December 2020, the health sector workforce had a total of 126,174 WTE. This is an increase of 6,357 WTE since the end of December 2019.</p>  <p>  To further assist student nurses and midwives on clinical placements, I appointed Profes­sor Tom Collins to carry out an independent review of the clinical placement allowance spe­cifically during COVID-19, a more stressful time of which we are all aware. Professor Collins reported back to me on 31 December, 2020 and made several recommendations which I have accepted. One of which was his recommendation to implement a pandemic placement grant, which is the non-taxable &euro;100 per week for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic. He provided an option for me to backdate this to the start of September. Therefore, the recommendation is that the 12 weeks of placement essentially would be subject to a non-taxable payment of &euro;1,200. As stated I have accepted the recommendations and work is ongoing to implement Professor Collins&rsquo;s recommendation for   a pandemic placement grant by making the associated payments. We continue the engagements with the representative bodies on this matter and the long term review. </p>  <p>  The long-term review of the placements and allowances to be carried out, I believe this is very important. This will go some way to addressing some of the issues that have been raised  by Deputies and others around supporting students to be students and assisting with some of the financial barriers that can impact students while they are undertaking their placements particularly when the placements are away from the base hospital.   </p>  <p>  That is one of the points that is going to be examined in the long-term review. The work has commenced and I have asked that I receive a report in June. That will give us some time to work with the students themselves, the representative bodies, the educators and all the stake­holders and work to implement any recommendations from the start of the academic year this coming September.</p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the difficulties that student nurses and midwives have had over the past year. Without question, it continues to be a difficult time. My Department and I, in conjunction with the HSE, higher education institutes, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, our clinical partners and representative organisations, will continue to focus on sup­porting our students, keeping them safe and ensuring they have the best possible education that they can have.</p>  <p>As the Deputy is aware, supernumerary clinical placements for 1-3rd year nursing and midwifery students were temporarily suspended from 18 January to support the HSE request to release senior, qualified staff employed to support student placements who had the necessary experience to help directly with the COVID-19 response.   However, placements with the necessary supports in place, have been gradually resuming and  this week  99%  of the nursing and midwifery students who were due to be on clinical placement were on placement. Intern and 4th year supernumerary placements have continued uninterrupted during this time. </p></reply>

In the European Union, there are two main routes for authorising medicines:  a centralised route and a national route.</p>  <p>  Under the centralised authorisation procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorisation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This allows the marketing authorisation holder to market the medicine and make it available to patients and healthcare professionals throughout the EU on the basis of a single marketing authorisation.</p>  <p>  While the majority of new, innovative medicines are evaluated by the EMA and authorised by the European Commission in order to be marketed in the EU, most generic medicines and medicines available without a prescription are assessed and authorised at national level in the EU. In addition, many older medicines available today were authorised at national level because they were marketed before the EMA was created.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have already been granted marketing authorisation by the EMA or the Health Products Regulatory Authority. In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I have no role in decisions relating to either the authorisation or reimbursement of medicines.</p></reply>

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  </p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated, and the AHR legislation is commenced. Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p></reply>

At that time, emergency legislation was introduced which amended all the regulatory acts to provide for a COVID-19 specific register to which no fees would be attached.  The Act provided that the COVID-19 registration would end on 31 July 2020, but that this could be extended by means of Ministerial order.  Orders were  made in July, 2020 extending the temporary registrations to 31 December 2020, and again in December further extending to 30 June 2021 the temporary registration provisions relating to medical practitioners, pharmacists and CORU registrants.  </p><p>Given that nursing and midwifery registration is based on a calendar year, an Order was not needed in July extending these to end December 2020, but rather the Irish Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) was able to deal with such registrations  ( including any new applications ) under its existing legislation. This continues to be the position and I can confirm that retired nurses who wish to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response, including the vaccination programme, can avail of temporary restoration to the NMBI register free of charge. The NMBI has informed my Department that it is currently working with the HSE and other employers to facilitate speedy restoration in these cases. As part of this, the NMBI is currently updating the registration system MyNMBI so that, from Monday next, 1 March 2021, fees will be waived automatically upon restoration - . Those wishing to restore on MyNMBI and who need support with the process can contact the NMBI directly at IEReg@nmbi.ie.</p><p>In addition, the NMBI is also now making arrangements to refund fees paid by some registrants who may not have been aware of the availability of free temporary restoration for purposes of assisting with the COVID-19 pandemic response. </p><p>I very much welcome the offer of the association referred to by the Deputy and its members, to return to the NMBI register to assist with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To expedite this the NMBI has contacted the association in recent days. </p><p>Finally, to clarify the general position applying to restoration to the Register. It is open to a nurse or midwife  to apply at  any time to be removed from the Register of the NMBI, for example on retirement. This is categorised as a voluntary removal and such registrants who later wish to be restored need only to pay the annual  renewal fee of &euro;100, which is the same amount as all other current registrants.  Those registrants who have been removed from the register following non-payment of the renewal fee of &euro;100, and who later wish to be restored, incur an additional administration charge of &euro;250 in addition to the annual fee of &euro;100.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department , endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department  and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link: </p><p>Family carers are a diverse group, therefore, each individual will be vaccinated in the group that is appropriate to them.  </p></reply>

No. 53/2020 - Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 which amended the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 (S.I. No. 390 of 1981), all medical practitioners, including clinical directors of diagnostic laboratories, are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health / Director of Public Health of certain diseases, including COVID-19. </p><p>The Medical Officer of Health also reports such cases onwards to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This is to ensure that test results are reported to relevant stakeholders for monitoring and surveillance purposes and to investigate cases, thus preventing spread of infection and further cases. This requirement also applies to all private testing services who are, therefore, legally obliged to report positive Covid-19 case to the relevant authorities. </p><p>Persons who test positive from an antigen test from a private company will not be reported to the HSE. These are unvalidated tests taken outside of the national testing strategy or without appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. In my answer to Parliamentary Questions 682, 683 and 684 of the same date from the same Deputy, I drew attention to the factual, up to date and accessible public facing information on private testing published on the HSE website . The HSE advises that if you test positive in this case, you should self-isolate and call your GP. They will arrange for you to get a free PCR test within the public testing system. </p><p>The NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) considers the use of Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) on an ongoing basis and has endorsed recommendations on the use of ADTs that have been validated as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited.</p><p>The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p></reply>

They are also being asked to undertake administrative functions with regard to patient identification and consent. As with other types of vaccinations, the fees reflect the amount of time required, administrative complexity, and the level of post-vaccination care likely required. Furthermore, as Ireland has a blend of public and private GP-care provision, the fees have been agreed in consideration that GPs will be providing this service to both private and public patients on an equal basis without charge.</p></reply>

The NPHET agreed that at present, there is insufficient high-quality evidence with respect to vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and noted that ongoing developments, particularly Randomised Control Trials, in this area be monitored by the NPHET with guidance reviewed accordingly. </p><p>The NPHET agreed that efforts should be made to increase awareness of existing guidance. Adults spending increased time indoors or those who are housebound or in long-term residential care or have dark skin pigmentation are also recommended to take a daily vitamin D supplement. </p><p>These recommendations for the use of vitamin D are being incorporated into wider messaging, and additionally are being communicated across the health service, including nursing homes and social care settings, as necessary. </p><p>The Department of Health has recently written to the HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland to encourage implementation of guidance on vitamin D in nursing homes. </p><p>The Government will continue to look to the NPHET to provide recommendations with regard to Vitamin D and COVID-19.  </p><p>Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin </p><p>The Deputy is advised that, at the request of the NPHET, HIQA conducted a rapid evidence review to identify studies on the effectiveness of (i) pharmaceutical and (ii) non-pharmaceutical interventions, in the ambulatory setting, aimed at reducing progression to severe disease in individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.</p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. The HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 unless as part of an ongoing monitored clinical trial. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting.  </p><p>As confirmed by the HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. </p><p>The HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. The HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4th February 2021 published a statement including the following: </p><p>&ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: </p><p>- No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; </p><p>- No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;</p><p>- A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies. </p><p>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; </p><p>I trust that the above information satisfactorily addresses your question. </p></reply>

The 2018 and 2019 Access Plans resulted in positive improvements in Inpatient and Daycase (IPDC) waiting lists which saw a reduction of 18% from 2017 to 2019, and some broader trends in improvement for GI Scopes and Outpatient (OPD) lists. The 2020 Access Plan had not been finalised for publication by March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of routine elective scheduled care for a number of months. </p>  <p>  In the context of addressing the impact of Covid-19 on scheduled care, the Government has allocated an additional &euro;210m to the HSE for access to care, which includes funding to help address the shortfall in acute hospital capacity, due to measures introduced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, and address waiting lists. An additional &euro;30m has also been given to the NTPF to help to address backlogs in waiting lists. This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving access to care including reducing waiting times for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, HSE and NTPF are working together to agree targets in relation to waiting list focused activity for 2021. It is expected that this work will conclude shortly. </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department , endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department  and further information is available here: . </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.  </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February. </p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. </p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.  </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. </p><p>Residents of long-term care facilities aged 18-64 will be vaccinated in Group 9. </p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>Provisional vaccine allocation groups are found here: </p><p> </p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session. The Bill will be enacted upon completion of all stages in the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President. </p></reply>

This includes a specific commitment to supporting &quot;the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland&quot;. A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls. </p><p>The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports such as the establishment of a centre of excellence for endometriosis surgery and optional access to psychologists in women&rsquo;s health settings, and enhanced information including a clear patient flow for period/pelvic pain and excessive bleeding and<b></b>a communications and education strategy to raise awareness of endometriosis and the supports and treatments available.</p><p>Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo; to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. Following confirmation of the fund, discussions with the Department and the HSE took place to identify activity under the proposals which may be implemented in 2021 and funded through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund. A number of proposals are currently being finalised with stakeholders. Following final internal review and approval, it is anticipated that actions supported by the fund will be announced in the coming weeks. Regular updates are provided on the official Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce webpage: </p><p>In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that the  HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p><p>The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care commenced in 2020, and the first three clinics were established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway, with a more limited clinic in Waterford. The clinics in Cork and Galway are currently providing services, while it is anticipated that the Rotunda clinic will be operational in 2021, once the necessary refurbishment works have been completed. It is also anticipated that the Waterford service will commence in 2021.

The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its ninth meeting held on February 19th 2021 and with regular updates provided through a dedicated webpage on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website at gov.ie/en/campaigns/-Womens-Health/</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo; to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This funding complements the additional significant investment delivered across women&rsquo;s health services in Budget 2021, including 12m investment in delivering the National Maternity Strategy and improving gynaecology and fertility services and 10m investment in Screening Services including Breast Check and Cervical Check.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has listened to, engaged with and worked with more than 1,000 individuals, and organisations representing women and girls across the country. Based on this consultation, and review of the evidence, the Taskforce has developed proposals to improve supports for gynaecological health, engagement with physical activity and supports for menopause which were chosen as initial priority areas. In 2021, the &euro;5m Women&rsquo;s Health Fund will deliver a programme of actions arising from this work, along with additional priority areas, including improving mental health supports for women and girls. A national awareness and education campaign will also be delivered to provide a trusted source of information and help normalise discussions about women&rsquo;s health.</p>  <p>  Following confirmation of the fund, discussions with the Department and the HSE took place to identify activity under the proposals which may be implemented in 2021 and funded through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund. A number of proposals are currently being finalised with stakeholders. Following final internal review and approval, it is anticipated that actions supported by the fund will be announced in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

In addition, the NWIHP was mandated to drive and lead the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. </p>  <p>  The NWIHP, therefore, provides strategic direction and leadership, drives improvement, and fosters a learning culture in maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services. The NWIHP also aims to ensure that learning from adverse incidents is disseminated and applied in a comprehensive and consistent manner, promoting a national approach to consistent, evidenced-based practice in maternity care. </p>  <p>  The NWIHP is intended to act as the single central authority on maternity care and as a reference point and resource for women&rsquo;s health issues within the HSE. The NWIHP is also tasked with the appropriate allocation of all new development funding for maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services, which includes the &euro;12m funding provided under Budget 2021 for new developments in maternity and gynaecology services. </p>  <p>  With regard to the status of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care, the roll out of Phase One commenced in 2020, with the establishment of the first three clinics under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Maternity Hospital and University Hospital Galway.

The Programme supports a wide variety of measures, including capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services, marketing and training, among others.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the EU EMFF Regulation was amended to facilitate Member States in providing COVID supports to seafood enterprises. The EMFF supports that could be provided to the fishing sector were quite specific, either a temporary fleet tie-up scheme or a storage aid market support scheme. The Regulation did not permit a more general financial support scheme similar to Restart Plus. Representatives of the fishing sector expressed a strong preference for a tie-up scheme, rather than storage aid, and thus a COVID-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme was implemented over the June to August period. The COVID supports under the EMFF Regulation ceased to be permitted after 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that an EU Regulation establishing a new fund for the 2021-27 period, the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, will be enacted in April 2021. My Department has been working for some time on developing Ireland's Seafood Development Programme 2021-27 under the new EU Regulation, and I anticipate that it will be in place later this year.</p></reply>

Charges for the use of the facilities at each of the six Fishery Harbour Centres are set out in secondary legislation by means of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates and Charges) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 214 of 2012) which came into effect on the 1st July 2012. Income from these charges pay for the day to day operational costs of the Fishery Harbour Centres.</p>  <p>  The crisis emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for Government from both public health and economic perspectives. The economic challenges are wide ranging and have impacted across all sectors. The Government response continues to be reviewed and will evolve in order to best meet current and future challenges as they arise. </p>  <p>  The fishing industry, unlike many other industries, has continued to operate throughout the pandemic, and while I am very conscious of the impact the pandemic has had on the industry, overall the level of activity has remained robust.</p>  <p>  Fishers operate from a wide range of Harbours around the State and the majority of these are owned and managed by the relevant local authority. It is a matter for each local authority to consider the position in relation to charges in those local authority harbours.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Fishery Harbour Centres fees for the landing of fish are only incurred by the fishers when catches are landed. As the operational costs of the Fishery Harbour Centres are dependent on monies from harbour dues, there are no current plans to waive these charges in the six Fishery Harbour Centres. However, I will continue to review the situation taking account of the evolving situation and the range of horizontal Government supports available.</p>  <p>  To date, a broad range of supports have been made available to the fisheries and aquaculture sectors through my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and more generally from Government. Fishing vessel owners and aquaculture producers whose trading income ceased due to the COIVID-19 pandemic, or crew members who lost their job or were temporarily laid off, were eligible to avail of income supports under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, while vessel owners with salaried crew members who instead maintained those crew members on the payroll were eligible for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. Further details on current horizontal measures are available from the Department of Social Protection, Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and from the Revenue Commissioners respectively.</p>  <p>  Between June and August 2020, supports were available from BIM through the EMFF Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme to fishers who choose to tie-up their vessel for up to two months. The Scheme supported the fixed costs of these vessels based on official data held by BIM. Supports of &euro;500 to &euro;6,000 per month were available depending on vessel size. Separately, an EMFF COVID-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme provided supports to aquaculture producers for lost sales and production, with payments of &euro;6,800 to &euro;16,300 for oyster producers and &euro;1,300 to &euro;9,000 for rope mussel producers, depending on previous production levels. </p>  <p>  These supports complemented the income supports separately provided by Government.</p></reply>

The relevant CFP Control Regulations do not define "supertrawler" or "factory trawler". However, "factory ship" is referred to in Annex XXIII of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 404/2011 (the Fisheries Control Implementing Regulation) in the context of the type of vessel to be recorded as part the information included in surveillance reports regarding sightings and detection of fishing vessels. Similarly, Annex XB of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1010/2009 (the Implementing Regulation for rules on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing) refers to "factory ship" in the context of the type of vessel recorded in reports of sighted vessels.</p>  <p>  These terms are sometimes used to describe large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring. In particular, "factory trawler" usually refers to vessels which process and freeze fish on board the vessel. As the Deputy will be aware, while the Irish fleet does not have "factory vessels", it does include very large fishing vessels which could be termed "supertrawlers".</p>  <p>  Under the CFP, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas. Fishing vessels, irrespective of size, must comply with the rules of the CFP, including rules on access and catch limits/quota.</p>  <p>  In relation to access to Ireland's coastal waters, I would point out that all foreign fishing vessels, on the north-west coast, are excluded from Ireland's 12 mile fishing zone, other than for transit purposes. All foreign pelagic fishing vessels are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12 mile fishing zone on the west coast. Irish fishing vessels greater than or equal to 36.58m (120 feet) in length are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12 mile zone.</p>  <p>  Ireland's control authorities, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service, are responsible for the monitoring and control of fishing vessels, including large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks, in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP.</p></reply>

This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 miles zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway. There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna. The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s. At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.</p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch. In this regard, the UK also had a share of the Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota and, under the EU/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a share of the EU&rsquo;s Bluefin Tuna quota (0.25%) has been transferred to UK. We are seeking that this transfer to the UK is taken from the overall EU quota and is not taken from the by-catch quota available to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data. A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters.</p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU. The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive. At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.</p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.</p></reply>

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone. </p>  <p>  While the outcome on fisheries was a difficult compromise, this Government is working to ensure that the fisheries sector, and the coastal communities that depend on it, are supported. I advised the EU Fisheries Council in January and again at the meeting earlier this week  that we consider that the quota transfers that fall to us in Ireland are disproportionate in terms of burden sharing. I have also made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly and Ireland will continue to push for a mechanism to be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions. Ireland intends to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Hague preferences, there are based on commitments made in Annex VII of Council Resolution of 3 November 1976 (the Hague Resolution) to take account of the vital needs of communities which were especially dependent on fishing when allocating fishing quotas to each of the Member States. This commitment was later quantified as specified minimum quantities of quota for certain fish stocks to be allocated to certain fisheries dependent communities. The regions to which they applied were Ireland, northern parts of the UK. </p>  <p>  The Hague Resolution passed on 3 November 1976 introduced the 200nm Exclusive Fisheries Zone for all the Member States of the European Community as well as laying down a series of guidelines for the development of the Common Fisheries Policy and obtaining a mandate to begin negotiations with third countries with regards to obtaining access rights to their newly claimed territorial waters. Ireland did not have a long distance fleet at that time and could only support these measures on the basis of commitments that allowed it to develop its fishing fleet. The Hague Resolution was also intended to recognise the considerable burden placed on Ireland to control the large fishing grounds in its 200 zone.</p>  <p>  There is strong opposition each year from some Member states to the application of the Hague Preferences, which provide Ireland (and previously the UK) with additional quota for key fish stocks. These Member States argue that the Hague Preferences were taken into account when allocations keys were first established in 1983.</p>  <p>Within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)  Regulation 1380/2013, the Hague Preferences are recognised as forming part of relative stability in the allocation of fish stocks between Member States. Ireland has consistently, and successfully, argued each year since that  when quotas are set at EU level, the Hague preference must be applied. It is important to be aware that the matter was the subject of a European Court of Justice Judgment which found that the application of the Hague Preferences is not a legal entitlement and that its application is at the discretion of the EU Fisheries Council.</p>  <p>  The EU/ UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets down in Annex Fish.1 the UK shares of fish stocks which are shared with the EU for the period 2021 to 2026 onwards. The share of the stocks set for the EU will be allocated within the EU under relative stability. In that regard, I can fully assure the Deputy that I will be requiring that the Hague Preferences are applied to relevant stocks, after the completion of the current consultations with the UK for establishing TACs for shared stocks, when the EU Council adopts EU Total Allowable Catches and quotas, which is expected at the March Fisheries Council.</p>  <p>  As I have already advised, I am finalising plans to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and other stakeholders to provide recommendations on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities. I intend to set out in the arrangements and the terms of reference for this Task Force very shortly. I will ask the Task Force to focus immediately on possible arrangements for a temporary fleet tie-up scheme to counter the impacts of the reduction in quotas which will impact our fishing industry from the beginning of April. The Task Force will, I hope, also provide recommendations on a range of other actions and measures that will allow the sector and the coastal communities to adjust and develop so that both the direct and downstream future impacts on the wider seafood sector can be taken into account.</p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations within the EU would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive. At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.</p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.</p></reply>

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone.</p>  <p>  The Agreement sets out new arrangements for the joint management of more than 100 shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters. Under the Agreement, EU fishing vessels will continue to have the current level of access to UK waters until 2026, but with a reduction of EU quotas in UK waters over that time. The changes in shares of stocks between the EU and the UK are set out in the Annexes to the Agreement from 2021-2026 (onwards). The share of the stocks set for the EU will be allocated within the EU by the Fisheries Council under relative stability and I will be working to ensure that this includes the application of the Hague Preferences.   </p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record). The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels reduce below a specified level.</p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.

I advised the EU Fisheries Council in January and again at the meeting earlier this week that we consider that the quota transfers that fall to us in Ireland are disproportionate in terms of burden sharing. I have also made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly and Ireland will continue to push for a mechanism to be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions. Ireland intends to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.</p>  <p>  The European Commission Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) will provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in Member States, regions and sectors, in particular those that are worst affected by that withdrawal, and to mitigate the related impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion. I have listened carefully to the representatives of the fishing industry and I am reflecting on how to ensure that the funding made available to the sector is focused to meet the challenges of the sector and of the coastal communities most impacted. </p>  <p>  I am finalising plans to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and other stakeholders to provide recommendations on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities. I intend to set out in the arrangements and the terms of reference for this Task Force very shortly.

I was heartened to read about the organisations&rsquo; work with younger farmers and I am in agreement that this is an area that should be expanded in the future.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the impact the current forestry licensing delays are having on private timber growers. Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett who is responsible for forestry, it is my immediate priority to deal with this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed to continue to contribute to our rural economy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system, which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. In 2020, we invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added this year. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year.  In addition, January saw the highest number of licences issued in any one month since July 2019. So far this year, 568 licences have issued, which is well ahead of what we had delivered at the same time last year. We intend to build on this momentum and have committed to issuing 4,500 licences in 2021.</p>  <p>  As regards the issues raised in relation to my Department&rsquo;s Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme, I would like to emphasise that this is a new Scheme which was opened for applications in June 2020. Two hundred and fifty applications have been received to date and decisions have been issued since the start of this year. No changes to the scheme are planned at this stage and I would like to point out that my Department has invested heavily since 2013 on breeding ash for resistance and there are many projects at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  I expect the implementation plan for the recommendations of the Mackinnon Report will be published this week and it will no doubt provide a framework for addressing the wide ranging issues faced by  the forestry sector, including the way forward for forestry in Ireland, in terms of a new Forestry Strategy and Programme.</p>  <p>  We look forward to active and constructive engagement from all interested parties across society to help shape this new vision.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that it is long-standing DAFM policy to encourage all forest producer groups to come together and have one collective, strong voice as part of this process.</p></reply>

Our Customer Charter and Customer Action plan commits us to treating everyone properly, fairly, impartially and with courtesy. We expect that our staff are engaged with in a similar way. Criticism of policy is, of course, not unusual and may at times be robust, but the norm is that there are respectful exchanges between the parties in the course of engagement with our sectors. A constructive working engagement between DAFM and our stakeholders is essential even if we do not always agree on some things. However, any approach that involves targeted personal abuse is a hindrance to this working relationship.</p>  <p>  In cases where personal abuse is reported by a member of staff, the staff member concerned is entitled to inform the person that the abuse is unacceptable. Where this abuse is personalised and targeted and/or extended over a period of time, the staff member&rsquo;s manager is entitled to take action out of a duty care for the staff member. This is particularly true where the person engaging in abuse has been informed that their interaction is unacceptable but continues with it. It would be remiss of the manager not to undertake such action in response in order to protect staff.</p>  <p>  Thankfully, the vast majority of stakeholders engage in a positive and constructive manner and instances of abuse are rare. Similarly, the need for the Department to take action in such instances is also rare but must, on occasion, be undertaken.</p></reply>
