As projects progress towards delivery, funds will be allocated to Departments in a process overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Disbursement from the Fund will proceed in accordance with Public Financial Procedures. As is normal, the Secretary General of the Government Department to which funding is allocated will be the Accounting Officer. </p><p>Funding allocated from the Shared Island Fund will foster new investment and development opportunities on a North/South basis and support the delivery of key cross-border infrastructure initiatives and commitment on Shared Island as set out in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Relevant Programme for Government commitments include those to:</p><p>- Enhance, develop and deepen all aspects of north-south cooperation and the all-island economy. </p><p>- Work with the Executive to deliver key cross-border infrastructure initiatives, including the A5, the Ulster Canal connection, the Narrow Water Bridge, and cross-border greenways, in particular the</p><p>Sligo-Enniskillen greenway. </p><p>- Work with the Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on the island of Ireland.</p><p>- Work with the Executive and the UK Government to commit to investment and development opportunities in the North West and Border communities, including third level opportunities for young people from</p><p>across the region at University of Ulster Magee Campus in Derry. </p><p>- Support a north/south programme of research and innovation, including an all-island research hub.</p><p>- Continue to deepen north-south health links. </p><p>- Explore how bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement can ensure there is a joined-up approach to environmental issues on an all-island basis and seek to develop an all-island strategy to tackle</p><p>climate breakdown and the biodiversity crisis.  </p><p>The Government is working in partnership with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council, including to progress key cross-border investment projects, which are part of our Shared Island commitments in the Programme for Government. These were discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Plenary in Dublin on 31 July, and an update on progress will be provided to the next NSMC Plenary meeting in December.</p></reply>

The ODCE will require further time to allow it to compile and tabulate the relevant data. Information for 2019 and up to 27 November 2020 is provided in tabular form below. The remaining information as requested is being collated and I will provide this information to the Deputy no later than 15th December 2020.</p><p>Information on cases investigated, number of cases closed without prosecution, number of cases closed with a successful prosecution and the number of cases that remain active and open in the years 2019 and to 27 November 2020 are as set out in tabular form below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>to 27 November 2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases investigated</td>       <td>402 </td>       <td>262 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases closed without prosecution</td>       <td>430 </td>       <td>209 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases successfully prosecuted</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases active and open at end of year </td>       <td>194</td>       <td>247 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Cases for the purposes of this question exclude liquidators&rsquo; reports and include:</p><p>- All files opened in response to the receipt of a mandatory or voluntary report;</p><p>- All complaints;</p><p>- All issues identified internally.</p><p>It is important to note that the number of investigations per se does not represent the totality of the work of the ODCE, firstly because of the volume of liquidation cases and secondly because not all investigations result in a prosecution.  As will be seen from the ODCE&rsquo;s Annual Reports, complaints are not always relevant to the remit of the Office but where they are, the matter is investigated. Only a small subset become investigations for the purposes of enforcement by prosecution.</p><p>Not all investigations are of a criminal nature and the ODCE policy is to seek rectification of breaches in the first instance, where the matter is appropriate for such action.  Not all enforcement actions taken by the ODCE result in Court applications. Rather, the ODCE operates a graduated approach towards enforcement. Where it is deemed an appropriate response, many issues can be addressed by exercise of powers without the necessity of bringing issues to the Courts for determination. This might include for example, production of registers and regularising breaches for the director loan provisions, which in 2019 secured the rectification on a non-statutory basis, of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014, in relation to Directors&rsquo; loans in 23 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;27.2m approximately. </p><p>The ODCE took a decision in recent years to concentrate its resources on more serious and complex investigations, the result of which is usually the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration, as opposed to a summary prosecution. It is important to appreciate that the purpose of a criminal investigation is not to secure a conviction. Rather, the purpose is to establish the facts. Thereafter, it is a matter for the DPP to determine, having regard to the facts and to potentially relevant offences, whether the direction of charges is appropriate and in the public interest.</p><p>In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions (i.e. prosecutions of relatively minor offences in the District Court). In 2020 the ODCE had two such cases which were closed without prosecution and one case which received directions to prosecute.</p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.</p><p>Section 949(3) of the Companies Act 2014 provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall be independent in the performance of his statutory functions. I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have no direct function in such matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I am progressing legislation in this area as part of the Government's work on white collar crime. Establishing the ODCE as the Corporate Enforcement Agency will give the Director greater autonomy and flexibility in terms of the ability to recruit staff with the necessary skills mix and depth of experience and will provide the Director with greater flexibility to adapt if the workload expands.</p></reply>

It is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee Scheme in Ireland.  </p><p>The Scheme was originally scheduled to run until 31 December 2020 in line with the requirements of the Temporary Framework on State Aid.  Following the extension of the terms of the Temporary Framework, Government approved on 24 November, the extension of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to run until 30 June 2021.</p><p>The Scheme provides an 80% State guarantee on lending for terms between 3 months and five and a half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million including working capital and term loan facilities.  Loans up to &euro;250,000 are unsecured.  It is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers.</p><p>As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans.  This low-cost funding along with other grants which are available provides ready access to funding for businesses during this unprecedented time.</p><p>As at 20 November, 2,301 applications were received for a value of &euro;135m and 1,140 loans with a value of &euro;54m were approved and drawn.The table below provides a breakdown of the number and value of loan applications received and the number and value of loans drawn down under the Scheme.</p><p><b>Table of loan applications received and loans drawn </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Number of loan applications received</th>       <th>Value of loan applications received</th>       <th>Number of loans drawn down</th>       <th>Value of loans drawn down</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>From 7 Sept - 2 Oct</td>       <td>616</td>       <td>&euro;33.5m</td>       <td>128</td>       <td>&euro;5.8m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>From 3 Oct - 30 Oct</td>       <td>983</td>       <td>&euro;58.9m</td>       <td>523</td>       <td>&euro;25.0m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>From 31 Oct &ndash; 20 Nov</td>       <td>702</td>       <td>&euro;42.5m</td>       <td>489</td>       <td>&euro;23.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total up to 20 Nov</td>       <td>2,301</td>       <td>&euro;134.9m</td>       <td>1,140</td>       <td>&euro;54.4m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Applications to access the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme are subject to eligibility criteria which are assessed by the credit departments of the individual lenders.  Decisions to refuse applications for loans and the reasons for doing so, are confidential matters between the applicant and the lender.  The Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process, which is fully delegated to the participating lenders. </p><p>Where a loan application has been refused it can be appealed through the bank's internal appeal system or to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. </p><p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is currently available through Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.  In recognition of the need to make this Scheme as widely available as possible an open-call for new on-lenders has been completed and proposals are being reviewed by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in respect of potential new lenders.  I therefore expect to confirm a number of new lenders will be joining the Scheme in the coming weeks which will increase access to the Scheme and make a wider range of products available to businesses.</p></reply>

While my Department is waiting for final data for Q3 2020, it is known that there has been little additional uptake of the Brexit Loan Scheme in Q3 of this year as businesses have diverted their attention to dealing with the impacts of COVID-19.</p><p>It should be noted that a proportion of the eligibility applications are reapplications from businesses that have previously been approved. Repeat applications typically arise where an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility approval has expired (six months after issuing) and the applicant applies for eligibility renewal.</p><p>To date, only 23 (2%) of the 1,175 applicants have been deemed ineligible for the scheme. Generally, this has been because they failed to meet either the Brexit-exposure criteria or the Innovation criteria under the scheme, because their sector is ineligible for the scheme, or because of an error in the application form (businesses may reapply to correct an error). </p><p>Loan approvals under the scheme are subject to the participating finance providers' own credit policies and procedures. </p><p>I am conscious that the delays to the Brexit process may have caused businesses to defer their Brexit preparations, and that the added disruption of the pandemic has meant that many businesses have had to focus their efforts on successfully navigating an unforeseeable crisis.</p><p>However, Brexit will mean change for Irish businesses. I am encouraging businesses to carefully consider their exposure to Brexit-related impacts, to take the necessary steps to insulate themselves from those impacts, and to ensure they continue to trade after 1 January.

It provides much-needed funding to help microenterprises meet payments for stock, working capital requirements and other overhead expenses through the provision of low-cost lending facilities.</p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  </p>  <p>  The new Microfinance Ireland (MFI) Brexit Business Loan which was launched on 23 November, will provide up to &euro;25,000 to businesses whose turnover already is or is likely to fall 15% or more or if the business has a short term cashflow need as a result of Brexit.  Loans are available for between 6 months and 3 years with an Interest rate of 4.5% available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The rate for direct applications to Microfinance Ireland is 5.5%.</p>  <p>  As this scheme has only been in operation for a week it is not yet possible to determine the potential uptake by year end.  There are indications that small businesses in particular are still waiting for a clearer picture of the terms that will apply to the UK&rsquo;s exit agreement before making their own commitments.  Microenterprises have a number of supports available to them through the LEO network and MFI in relation to dealing with the impacts of both COVID-19 and Brexit.  Their business decisions to avail of these loans and other supports will depend on the market conditions experienced in the months ahead.  For the clients of MFI, it is expected that this loan will be primarily used to avoid supply chain disruption and importations as opposed to exporting companies. MFI will have adequate funding to support micro businesses affected by Brexit as a result of increased allocations of Exchequer funding throughout 2020. </p>  <p>  This scheme has been made available as an additional support to business to help reduce the negative impacts of Brexit and will continue to be available into 2021.  I can assure the Deputy that officials from my Department will continue to work with MFI to ensure promotion of the Scheme to a wide variety of audiences. </p></reply>

It is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee Scheme in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme provides an 80% State guarantee on lending for terms between 3 months and five and a half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million including working capital and term loan facilities.  Loans up to &euro;250,000 are unsecured.  It is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers.</p>  <p>  As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans.  This low-cost funding along with other grants which are available provides ready access to funding for businesses during this unprecedented time.</p>  <p>  As at 20 November, 2,301 applications were received for a value of &euro;135m and 1,140 loans with a value of &euro;54m were approved and drawn (1,382 loans with a value of &euro;66m were approved and drawn up to 26 November).  </p>  <p>  The Scheme was developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework to take advantage of the relaxation of State Aid rules and required approval from the European Commission.  The Scheme was originally scheduled to run until 31 December 2020 in line with the requirements of the Temporary Framework.  Following the extension of the terms of the Temporary Framework, Government approved on 24 November, the extension of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to run until 30 June 2021.  Thereby making lending facilities available until that date.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is currently available through Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.  In recognition of the need to make this Scheme as widely available as possible an open-call for new on-lenders has been completed and proposals are being reviewed by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in respect of potential new lenders.  I therefore expect to confirm a number of new lenders will be joining the Scheme in the coming weeks which will increase access to the Scheme.  These new lenders will also provide an opportunity for SMEs to avail of a wider range of products in 2021.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy Government will continue to work with lenders to increase the visibility and accessibility of the Scheme and to ensure it continues to be promoted to a wide variety of audiences.</p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.  </p><p>I am advised by NBI that as of 23 November 2020, over 136,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Of this figure, over 16,000 premises have been surveyed to date in Cork including in the areas of Carrigaline and Midelton, which includes Cobh, and network designs completed to deliver the new Fibre to the Home (FTTH) network there. The first fibre to the home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline and  will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. </p><p>  Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 November, 149 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI, with 59 already connected to high speed broadband service. The remaining locations will be connected through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development in the coming months. In Cork, BCPs at Ballindangan Community Centre,<font color="#212121"> </font>Aghabullogue Community Centre<font color="#212121">, </font>Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre<font color="#212121">, </font>Whitechurch Community Centre<font color="#212121"> and </font>T.O. Park Labbamollaga have been connected.  Further BCPs  at Bere Island Heritage Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre and Ballydaly Community Hall have had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Some 52 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 22 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Cork, a number of schools including Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School Schools will be connected as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. Further details can be found at   .</p></reply>

As a demand led scheme, it is difficult to forecast the cost to the Exchequer in 2021 and 2022 of the measure.  When it was announced in late July, it was tentatively estimated that the scheme could involve an Exchequer cost of about &euro;270 million.  This was an outside estimate based on 2.15 million individual taxpayers fully availing of a tax credit of &euro;125. </p>  <p>  The scheme is due to operate until 30 April next year but I do have the flexibility to extend it beyond that date.   </p>  <p>  However, much will depend on how matters unfold in the weeks and months ahead both in terms of the impact on take up and on associated costs.  I will be monitoring the scheme, to see how it&rsquo;s working and if any changes need to be made. We need to keep policies that are working, and change ones that might not be working as planned, but at all times, ensuring they are affordable.</p>  <p>  However, to the extent that spending on the scheme may be less than the original cost estimate, this of course means that we need to borrow less and accumulate less debt.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to recall that the Stay and Spend tax credit should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures I have put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. The VAT reductions; the extension of the wage support scheme until next year and its extension to new or seasonal staff; and other Government measures all play a part in helping the sector cope with the challenges it faces.</p></reply>

This provides for a number of temporary income tax measures to assist self-employed individuals. Section 395A TCA 1997 provides for income tax relief for losses incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 by individuals carrying on a trade or profession, either as sole traders or in partnerships. The section provides that where, in a tax year, an individual carrying on a trade or profession:</p><p>- incurs a loss which would be available to carry forward to the following tax year, and</p><p>- all or part of the loss is incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020,</p><p>then the individual may claim to have any part of the loss that is incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 carried back and set off against the profits of the same trade or profession for the tax year 2019. Subject to meeting certain conditions, self-employed individuals may make an interim claim for relief in respect of an estimated amount of the relief that will be due to them under section 395A TCA 1997. Similar provisions apply in respect of unused capital allowances relating to the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The maximum amount of relief that an individual may claim in respect of losses and capital allowances is capped at &euro;25,000.</p><p>Where a self-employed individual incurs losses in the tax year 2020 and the tax year 2021, relief will be available where, in the tax year, part of those losses were incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. Therefore, the loss relief will be available to a self-employed individual who prepares their annual accounts on the basis of the period 1 April to 31 March each year. Examples setting out the operation of this relief are contained in Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty Manual Part 12-01-03, which is published on Revenue&rsquo;s website. </p><p>Turning now to <b>corporation tax</b>, section 11 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 introduced a new section 396D in the TCA 1997. The provision allows companies, subject to certain conditions, to make a claim to carry back up to 50% of their estimated trading losses incurred in an accounting period which contains some or all of the period 1 March to 31 December 2020, against their profits of the preceding accounting period. </p><p>Under normal rules, this carry back would not take place until up to nine months after the end of the loss-making accounting period, when the corporation tax return is filed. The accelerated corporation tax loss relief allows claims to be made (and revised if necessary) at any time from four months into the loss-making accounting period and up to five months after the end of that accounting period. This significantly accelerates the tax repayments to companies that can be generated from the offset of these losses against previously taxed profits. The balance of the loss will be available for carry back in due course under normal rules, when accounts have been prepared after the end of the company&rsquo;s accounting period and a corporation tax return has been filed. Therefore, provided it satisfies the relevant conditions, a company with a 12-month accounting period ending in March 2021 will be allowed to project the trading loss that it expects to suffer in its 2021 tax year and to lodge an early claim for carry-back of some of that expected loss against taxable profits of the prior year, being the accounting period ended 31 March 2020.  </p><p>Income tax example</p><p>A self-employed trader prepares his tax returns on the basis of the period ended 31 March each year. </p><p>For the tax year 2020, the basis period is: 1 April 2019 &ndash; 31 March 2020. If the trader incurs a loss in the tax year 2020 (i.e. in the period 1 April 2019 &ndash; 31 March 2020), the loss relief will be available for that part of the loss that was incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2020.</p><p>For the tax year 2021, the basis period is: 1 April 2020 &ndash; 31 March 2021. If the trader incurs a loss in the tax year 2021 (i.e. in the period 1 April 2020 &ndash; 31 March 2021, the loss relief will be available for that part of the loss that was incurred in the period 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2020.</p><p>However, regardless of whether the loss was incurred in the tax year 2020 or the tax year 2021, where relief is available the loss is to be carried back and set off against the profits of the same trade or profession for the tax year 2019. The rationale for this is that it was, and is, considered that it would be more beneficial to businesses to have the losses set back to a period during which the COVID-19 restrictions were not in place and normal trading conditions applied.</p></reply>

Furthermore, if Irish tax legislation was amended to provide for a minimum withholding tax on all royalty payments leaving the State for a non-EU country, this would also be subject to the rules for the taxation of such payments as agreed in double taxation treaties with the counties of receipt.  For this reason, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the revenue to be generated by applying a withholding tax on such payments.</p>  <p>  Regarding Question 40712/20, the primary purpose of Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) is to collect tax at source from dividend payments and other distributions made by Irish resident companies to resident individuals who are chargeable to income tax on such distributions.  A credit is then allowed against the individual's income tax liability for the DWT deducted on the distributions. Non-resident persons, who are not chargeable to tax in respect of the dividend income concerned, are generally exempt from DWT.  There are certain exceptions to this general treatment, such as REIT dividends in respect of which foreign shareholders may be subject to DWT. </p>  <p>  Deducting DWT in cases where there is no ultimate liability to Irish tax on the dividend income would result in any DWT deducted being refunded, creating an additional administrative burden for the recipient of the dividend and for Revenue, with no net additional yield to the Exchequer. Also, as with royalty payments, if the Irish legislation was amended to provide for a minimum withholding tax on all dividend payments leaving the State for a non-EU country, any amounts withheld would be subject to the relevant tax treaty rules on such payments. </p></reply>

This review is being led by the Nitrates Expert Group, which includes scientific experts from my own Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Nitrates Expert Group will assess the available information, including public submissions, water quality monitoring data and the most up to date scientific evidence, and will advise my Department on the measures that should be included in the next NAP. A comprehensive list of topics for consideration has been included in the current public consultation document and these will form the basis for the review. </p><p>At this early stage of the review process, no decisions have been made on any measures that may be included in the next NAP, including placing any limits on grazing platform stocking rates.</p><p>A copy of the public consultation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.housing.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic. </p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.</p>  <p>  Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. </p>  <p>  This is not a blanket ban. Local authorities can use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  There are further exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income. For applicants whose post-TWSS/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  </p>  <p>  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.</p>  <p>  In relation to proof required to support applications, local authorities have been advised to request confirmation from applicants as to whether their wages are currently supported by the EWSS.  Furthermore, as the EWSS is operationally paid to the employer and does not neccessarily appear on employee pay slips; local authorities have also been advised to take the necessary steps to secure appropriate written confirmation from the employer on whether an applicant&rsquo;s wages are supported by the EWSS and to advise applicants of this requirement.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school received an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of the Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, was not necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools would review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <i></i>.</p></reply>

I have met with F&oacute;rsa, who represent many of the secretaries working in schools.</p>  <p>  In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with with F&oacute;rsa on the claim, most recently on 27th of October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  At that meeting it was agreed that further discussions would be held under the auspices of the WRC with a view to assessing the individual elements comprising the totality of the union&rsquo;s claims.  It is noted that these WRC discussions are taking place within the context of recent D&aacute;il comments concerning the regularisation of pay, conditions of employment and pension provision of School Secretaries and Caretakers.  </p>  <p>  I welcome and support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching an agreed outcome.</p></reply>

In the 2019/2020 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy, my Department understands that this service is a privately operated service which is not part of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p>  <p>Health advice received from NPHET on the 18th August impacted on the operation of post-primary school transport services.

Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  </p>  <p>  Commercial contractors who provide transport for schools on a private hire or commercial basis but who are not contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate on the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme do not fall under the remit of the Department of Education.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Qualifying payments for fuel allowance are those payments that are considered long term payments and an applicant must also satisfy a means test.  The PUP was introduced by my Department in March 2020 and is available to all employees and the self-employed who have lost employment due to a downturn in economic activity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  When introduced the scheme was expected to be a short term measure and applicants do not have to satisfy a means test to qualify for the payment. </p>  <p>  Any decision to include the PUP as a qualifying payment for fuel allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations taking into consideration the resources available to my Department.</p>  <p>  While the PUP is not a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance, similar to the short-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, it does not prevent an otherwise qualified household from receiving the payment. Periods spent in receipt of PUP immediately before receipt of a Jobseeker's payment can be considered towards the 390 days necessary to qualify for fuel allowance on that payment.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

Consequently, there are over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. To date, over 13 million individual payments have issued over a 36 week period. </p>  <p>   Arrears in respect of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will arise under two broad headings. Firstly, there may have been an initial time lag in the commencement of payments. During the month of March, the Department of Social Protection received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. Almost 59,000 people were paid in the first week of the scheme, increasing to 283,000 people in the following week and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. The focus was on putting claims into payment as quickly as possible was and it was not possible to generate arrears payments at the time.  Secondly, arrears may also arise in respect of individual weeks where claims could not be processed due to incomplete applications or data mismatches. </p>  <p>  The Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department has developed an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date). </p>  <p>  As PUP claim processing was prioritised in the Department with most claims being paid within a week the majority of PUP claimants (about 66%) are not due any arrears. However in cases where there were delays in issuing the payment or where claims were submitted late (about 34% of cases) some arrears may be due.</p>  <p>   I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this week, in addition to the normal weekly PUP payments, the Department of Social Protection has started the process of paying arrears of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment with payments valued at &euro;129.2m issuing to approximately 286,000 people.  </p>  <p>  The vast majority  of arrears cases are being paid today. However, there are a smaller number of cases, and numbering less than 6,000,  where the Department is continuing to examine records and any arrears that may be due in these cases will be paid as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The company is aware of this process and are working on the individual requests as they get them. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to a casual jobseeker's or short-time work support payment for any day during that period depends, among other things, on whether or not a person received remuneration from their employer for that day.  Each case needs to be examined individually to determine if the remuneration paid by the company concerned was in respect of a complete period or only specific days within a period.  This will determine if a person may be entitled to a casual jobseeker's payment in respect of the days on which a person did not work.</p>  <p>  Because of the volume and complexity of claims involved and the need to go back to individual claimants, the process will take some time.</p>  <p>  Once a decision is made on a particular claim, my Department will notify that claimant of the outcome and it will be open to any person who is not satisfied with this decision to seek a review or to appeal that decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy</p></reply>

These regulations stipulate that all staff working directly with children must hold a minimum of a Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education on the National Framework of Qualifications or a qualification deemed equivalent.</p><p>The introduction of the minimum Level 5 Major Award requirement had been initially announced in 2013, and my Department provided extensive financial investment to support staff to achieve the relevant qualification in the form of multiple Learner Fund bursary rounds between 2014 and 2016. Great strides were made by the sector and over 96% of staff in 2019 held the necessary qualification. To accommodate staff who were due to retire, the Department made available an option for unqualified staff who were planning to retire over the coming years, to sign a grandfather declaration that enabled them to work without qualification for a 5-year period up to September 2021.</p><p>The minimum qualification requirement was introduced to raise the quality of provision for children and improve child outcomes. <i>First 5,</i>the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care. The evidence is irrefutable about the importance of the first five years of life for children's learning. Children achieve better outcomes when staff are qualified. This is undisputed internationally.  <i>First 5 </i>seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce&rsquo;. In line with <i>First 5</i>, my Department is currently leading on a Workforce Development Plan which will set out actions to support professionalisation of the workforce, including achieving a graduate-led workforce and raising the profile of careers in the sector by 2028 (A First 5 objective is that 50% of the workforce will have degrees by 2028). </p><p>Any decision to extend the grandfathering arrangement or to lower qualification requirements - even temporarily - would run counter to the direction of Government and international policy in this area and would require a strong evidence base. My Department is continuing to monitor workforce developments in the sector and gather data on recruitment difficulties. New data will be available in the coming weeks as part of the annual Pobal Early Years Sector Profile. It is understood that there is a sufficient supply of qualified workers into the sector -  the challenge is that they are not being retained, primarily due to poor working terms and conditions. It is the latter issue that needs to be addressed, and other measures will seek to do this. My Department is committed to continuing to work with the sector to find solutions to problems that meet the needs of children, families and providers.</p></reply>

Progress is monitored by a Steering Committee which includes both Traveller and Roma representatives and Civil Society organisations. On 12 November last,  I chaired a meeting of the Steering Group. </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy, funding has been made available to Traveller and Roma organisations to support their core activities, and to progress specific commitments in the Strategy. This funding includes special initiatives to promote Traveller and Roma employment and a new pilot programme working with Traveller and Roma families to support children&rsquo;s education. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the specific nature and extent of the needs of the Roma community in Ireland, the unique challenges in ensuring that Roma individuals and families can access services and supports, and the particular infrastructure and approach required to secure the inclusion of Roma in mainstream provision. In light of this, a subgroup was convened to identify the specific needs of Roma and to foster discussion on developing responses which are culturally sensitive.</p>  <p>  During the current pandemic the Health Service Executive (HSE) operates a self-isolation centre in Dublin.  It manages a Roma Covid-19 resource site which includes material in relevant languages.  It also funds a Roma helpline and my Department has funded associated interpretation costs.

It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted. The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending:</p><p><b>- Level 1</b>, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services,<b></b>includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.</p><p><b>- Level 2</b>involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County/City Childcare Committees.</p><p><b>- Level 3 </b>recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).</p><p><b>- Level 4 </b>addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early years education (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.</p><p><b>- Level 5 </b>recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early years settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service.</p><p><b>- Level 6 </b>provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable the child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE Programme.</p><p><b>- Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room </b>involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff / child ratio, supporting the Pre-School Leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p><p>The Early Years Services Regulations require that all staff who are employed by an early learning and care provider to work directly with children of pre-school age - including staff funded through AIM Level 7 funding for additional assistance - must hold, at a minimum, a major award at level 5 on the NFQ in Early Childhood Care and Education or a qualification deemed equivalent by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>The December 2016 amendment to the Regulations (S.I. no.632 of 2016) provided for exceptional cases in which an exemption from the Level 5 requirement may be made in the context of AIM. This provision allows, for example, for employment of a nurse to support a child with complex healthcare needs who requires specialised nursing support to attend the pre-school setting. Such an exemption requires specific approval from Pobal, as specified in the Quality and Regulatory Framework published by Tusla, the independent statutory regulator, and in the Funding Agreement for the ECCE pre-school programme.</p><p>The above provisions are in place to ensure that the needs of the child are central to the delivery of the supports provided by quality early learning and care services through the Access and Inclusion Model.</p></reply>

A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and some would also be categorised as being in the at-risk groups identified by public health authorities.</p>  <p>  From experience to date, it is evident that remote meetings based on the use of technology present additional challenges for an engagement process as sensitive as this one. However, throughout 2020, the members of the Forum have been appraised of developments and updated on any matters related to the Commission of Investigation by the Secretariat to the group. It is the practice and policy of my Department to issue updates and announcements to the Forum and other relevant stakeholders before they are issued more generally.</p>  <p>  I have acknowledged the recent shortcomings in our communications and engagement in relation to the Records legislation, and I have voiced my commitment to renewed engagement with survivors and their advocates, including members of the Collaborative Forum. As an important first step in meeting this commitment, I have personally engaged directly with members of the Collaborative Forum, and other stakeholders. I have given them my commitment to convening a meeting of the Collaborative Forum in whatever manner is possible following the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are being advanced to seek approval from Government to publish the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. In responding to the Commission's findings, I recognise that dialogue with those who have lived experiences of these institutions is essential. I want to take a survivor-centred approach, characterised by consistent engagement with former residents and their representative groups on matters of concern to them and their families. An enhanced model of engagement will be established, following consultation with the Collaborative Forum, and building on the learning from the Forum's significant work to date. I am conscious of broadening direct participation in our structured dialogue with former residents and I will consult beyond the current Forum membership in this regard. </p>  <p>  As part of my deliberations, I am considering how best to facilitate the administration and leadership of a renewed engagement process.  I am mindful of the importance of establishing a consultation process that is inclusive and which seeks to capture the diverse voices and perspectives on these deeply personal and sensitive issues. </p></reply>

Parents now apply to the Scheme directly, and only approach childcare providers once they have completed their application and have a CHICK to register. </p>  <p>  The NCS pays subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent. Childcare providers are not required to change their policies or operations.</p>  <p>  When a subsidy award is generated under the NCS, all elements of the award are visible.

The rate to which the Deputy refers is the maximum subsidy rate available for school age children.</p>  <p>  Higher subsidies are available for younger children, to reflect the higher cost of providing childcare for them because of the higher adult-child ratios required by Regulations.</p>  <p>  Subsidies range from a maximum of &euro;5.10 per hour for babies, &euro;4.35 for 1 and 2 year olds, &euro;3.95 for 3, 4 or 5 year olds prior to school entry, and &euro;3.75 for school age children. These reflect ratios of 1 adult to 3,5,6,8 and 12 children respectively. So, for example, in school age childcare services, 12 children can be looked after by one adult. 12 children being charged &euro;3.75 per hour would generate income of &euro;45 per hour. The average pay in the sector in &euro;12.55 per hour and staff costs are estimated to make up approximately 70% of overall costs. It is recognised that staff may be paid for non-contact time with children, and annual leave and other costs accrue for providers. Additionally many services use more profitable parts of their business to cross subsidise those less profitable.</p>  <p>  Based on data collected for the Independent Review of the Costs published by Crowe in recent weeks, the average hourly unit cost for delivering childcare across all services was found to be &euro;4.14. This tallies with the work done to identify the appropriate rate for NCS subsidies when the scheme was launched last year. While this data give us some confidence in our levels of State subvention, it is acknowledged that these figures vary across service type and geographical location. Also they represent current costs, and were cost to increase to pay higher wages, subsidies may have to rise accordingly if the additional cost is not to be passed on to parents.</p>  <p>  Outputs from the Independent Review of the Costs will form a key input into the setting of capitation and subvention rates for future funding schemes. The development of a cost calculator as part of Crowe's work will assist the Department to accurately estimate the impacts of potential future policy changes on the cost of delivering a service. </p>  <p>  Any service providers experiencing financial challenges can seek to access sustainability funding via the Pobal Case Management system. Amongst other benefits, the case management system supports providers in adjusting their business model away from being centred on older legacy schemes. This service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance, but financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges, following an assessment. </p>  <p>  As part of the monitoring, review and evaluation of the National Childcare Scheme, section 26 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 requires that a formal review of the NCS takes place after 12 months. The rationale for the review is to identify, in a timely way, any key issues or challenges which need to be addressed. The DECDIY will be seeking input to this review in the coming months from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

To the extent that the issues in question fall within my Department's remit, they are being reviewed and considered by both myself and my officials.</p>  <p>  Certain other cross-cutting issues will be referred to the relevant Departments and, where appropriate, to the Attorney General for consideration. I know that the Taoiseach shares with me the desire to ensure that we take a coherent whole-of-Government approach to the matter of institutional records.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I am open to engagement with independent experts in the area of GDPR, and will pursue this, whilst respecting the ultimate role of the Office of the Attorney General as the Government&rsquo;s legal adviser as prescribed in Article 30 of the Constitution.</p></reply>

This &lsquo;Raising Amazing&rsquo; foster care week has led to enquiries from people interested in becoming foster carers and following due process it is anticipated will lead to new foster carers. </p><p>Tusla is also engaged in recruiting carers who can be an appropriate match  for children from  Traveller and Roma communities. Dedicated project workers with links to these communities will be recruited to work alongside the Tusla fostering teams.  </p><p>Tusla, in conjunction with my Department,  is also working on recruiting additional foster carers to care for unaccompanied minors under an  enhanced specialised service called Failte Care.  This foster care service  will focus on providing placements for unaccompanied children  seeking asylum and unaccompanied refugee children and will provide key supports to them and their foster carers.</p><p>Issues that impact on the need for ongoing recruitment of foster carers include the number of young adults that are remaining with carers when they leave care. In the middle of this year, Tusla reported that  47% of young people availing of an aftercare service remained living with their carers. This trend, whilst highly desirable, contributes to the  of availability of foster carers.</p><p>Another interesting trend is the growing stability of placements of children in foster care.  Tusla publish data on the number of children in care in their third or greater placement within the previous 12 months. This metric is considered a proxy for placement stability.  At the end of December 2019, there were 137 children in their third or greater placement within the previous 12 months, which accounts for 2.3% of the care population only. This percentage has remained relatively stable over the last five years (Table 1).</p><p>Table 1 Children in the third or greater placement within the previous 12 months, 2015-2019 <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td># children in care </td>       <td>6,364 </td>       <td>6,267 </td>       <td>6,116 </td>       <td>5,974 </td>       <td>5,916 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td># in 3rd placement </td>       <td>132 </td>       <td>169 </td>       <td>142 </td>       <td>114 </td>       <td>137 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>% in 3rd placement </td>       <td>2.1% </td>       <td>2.7% </td>       <td>2.3% </td>       <td>1.9% </td>       <td>2.3% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Source: Review of Adequacy report, 2019, p.66)</p><p>This data does not include children in care under the Social Work Team for Separated Children Seeking Asylum</p><p>At the end of December 2019, there were 137 children in their third or greater placement within the previous 12 months. This amounts to 2.3% of all children in care, up slightly from 1.9% (114/5,974) in 2018 when the lowest percentage for the period 2015 &ndash; 2018 was reported, but similar to that for 2017 (2.3%)  </p><p>While the percentage compares favorably with percentages reported in other jurisdictions including England 10%; Wales 10% and Scotland 5.1% (2017/2018 data), interpretation needs to be considered in the context of differing processes and procedures and definitions that may exist in other jurisdictions. </p><p>The achievement of this level of stability requires Tusla to have an ongoing stream of new foster carers available and while there is a small downward trend in the number of children in care this does not impact significantly on the need of new carers. </p><p>In 2021, my Department intends to bring enhanced policy and strategic focus to the critically important area of Children in Care. This work will be advanced in collaboration with Tusla and a key component of this will be the support and development of foster care.</p></reply>

I had signalled previously that there would be a short time interval between receipt of the report and the separate arrangements for its publication. The necessary considerations are being expedited to enable this to happen as soon as possible. It is essential that this is done in the right way, with former residents being given the priority and support they deserve.  </p>  <p>  I expect to confirm publication arrangements shortly as I believe this could provide some reassurance to those most centrally involved. Former residents will be notified by my Department, through established channels, before any details are confirmed to media. Unfortunately, information appearing in media over recent days is speculative and not accurate. </p>  <p>  It is important to be as clear as possible on the matter of the Commission's records. The archive of the Commission of Investigation is still in the Commission&rsquo;s possession. The transfer of the archive to my Department, and the question of access to personal information within these records, are completely separate matters to the arrangements for publication of the final report.   </p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020 provides for the deposit of the Commission's database with Tusla, in addition to transferring a copy of this data, together with the Commission's entire archive of records, to me as the prescribed Minister. The archive will be transferred to my Department by 28 February next. Thereafter, my Department will be able to process subject access requests from people who wish to seek access to personal information that may be contained within these records. </p>  <p>  The database compiled by the Commission during the course of its investigation is a digital record of the mothers and children who spent time in 15 of the 18 institutions which were under investigation. This system will be an invaluable resource for Tusla now, and for whatever statutory body will be charged with information and tracing services into the future. The legislation also outlines the current restrictions placed on Tusla for the use of the database in delivering its services. </p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt, section 5 of the 2020 Act refers to the obligation on the Commission to deposit its records in accordance with section 43 of Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. The existing legal framework of the 2004 Act provides that this information will be retained by my Department for a period of 30 years prior to its transfer to the National Archives. </p>  <p>  My Department is working intensively to ensure that it is prepared to appropriately manage subject access requests in respect of records within the archive and to provide people with as much personal data as possible. In that regard, my officials are also liaising with the Office of the Attorney General to clarify the nature of the balancing tests which must apply to the release of personal information, both under the GDPR itself as transposed by the Data Protection Act 2018, and under section 39 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, as amended by the Data Protection Act 2018. As certain records may contain mixed personal data, it is vital that my Department, in processing subject access requests, ensures that the rights of all parties are protected in accordance with law.  </p>  <p>  These issues underline the importance of enacting a robust legal regime to underpin access to birth information and tracing services. I have given a commitment in this regard, and I will bring forward fresh proposals on information and tracing next year. </p></reply>

Since 2015 an average of 30 new painting and decorating apprentices have registered each year.  This represents roughly 10-20% of pre-recession numbers and as of 30th October 2020, only 16 new apprentices had registered to the trade this year. Consequently, existing Phase 2 training provision for the Painting and Decorating National Apprenticeship is undertaken by the City of Dublin ETB, in its Training Centre in Ballyfermot, Dublin. Phase 4 &amp;amp; 6 training is delivered within TU Dublin's City Campus. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in situations where apprentices are required to move from their current place of residence in order to take up an offer of a training place they are entitled to make an application for an accommodation allowance, in addition to their weekly training allowance, for the duration of the off-the-job training.</p>  <p>  Cork Education and Training Board have advised that it still maintains a Painting and Decorating workshop, which has been converted for the delivery of signwriting training for the unemployed following the decline of painting and decorating apprenticeship training ten years ago.

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  The university sector is already engaging with these issues, and all seven universities have confirmed that students who choose to vacate their university-owned accommodation early will receive pro-rata refunds. The exact details of these refunds vary by institution, and students are encouraged to engage with their university directly on this manner. I will continue to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation. </p>  <p>  For students in the private rental market, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p></reply>

Safe Pass, Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) and Quarrying Skills Certification Scheme (QSCS) courses were included in Phase 2 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business alongside the re-opening of the construction sector.  The courses were permitted to restart under strictly controlled Covid-19 precaution measures which were reviewed by the Department&rsquo;s scientific advisor prior to finalisation.</p>  <p>  These measures include restrictions in relation to maximum class sizes reducing the maximum number of participants from twenty to ten participants. All SOLAS approved Safe Pass providers are independent commercial entities and course fees are determined by these Approved Training Organisations. SOLAS has no role in the setting of fees for Safe Pass courses apart from a charge of &euro;32 for the processing, manufacturing and distribution of Safe Pass cards, which is generally included in the overall price for attending a course.</p>  <p>  The strict control measures have allowed the courses to remain open during fluctuating Covid-19 control measures, providing some certainty to workers seeking access to sites and occupations for which Safe Pass is required. By the end of October over 10,000 Safe Pass cards had issued to first-time holders, with an additional 23,700 renewal cards issued.</p>  <p>  Holders of Safe Pass cards with an expiry date after 1st March 2020 have had the period of validity extended to the end of the Covid-19 emergency period. This legislative provision introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) remains in force at the current time, however workers with expired cards are advised to renew their cards as soon as possible to prevent a significant backlog accruing.   SOLAS is actively examining alternative delivery methods to identify a solution that is equitable with existing Safe Pass course delivery, in being accessible to all eligible workers, providing real time course participant supports and ensuring assessment integrity.</p></reply>

Any such request would, however, need to be founded on some material change in the person&rsquo;s circumstances which has arisen since the original decision to deport was made. Where such a request is made, the outcome of that request will be that the existing deportation order will either be 'affirmed' or 'revoked'.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

However, this arrangement is kept under review, having regard to emerging pressures, planned retirements, etc.  </p>  <p>  The vacancies in the Circuit and District Courts will be filled as soon as possible.  The Government is committed to ensuring adequate resources for the Courts to provide access to justice for all citizens and to filling judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity generally. </p>  <p>  Judicial appointments are made in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government.  As with all judicial vacancies, a request is made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) for a list of suitable candidates for appointment and the names of all those who applied. The JAAB recommendations, along with any expressions of interest from serving judges, and all eligible judges for appointment, are considered.  I then, as Minister for Justice, submit a Memorandum for Government to the Cabinet Agenda at which point Cabinet agrees on a nominee for appointment by the President. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the judicial appointments process and I intend to bring forward new legislation to do this very quickly.  I will shortly seek the approval of the Government for a new General Scheme of a Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2020 to provide for the establishment of a new Commission to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to establish a working group to consider the numbers and types of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years.  Preparatory work within my Department is under way and I anticipate that this group will be established soon. </p></reply>

Where the place of commission cannot be determined the offence should be recorded against the Garda Sub-district in which it was reported. Criminal offences under Irish law that are committed abroad (such as those under the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996) should be recorded against the Garda Sub-district in which it was reported.&rdquo;</i></p></reply>

Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) is working with the HSE and the NTPF to improve access to treatment and reduce waiting times for children, including access to diagnostics such as MRI scans.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The initial funding sanction has been increased accordingly and a total of &euro;92.5m is being made available in 2020 and a further &euro;42m is available for 2021. As of 1 December 2020, there have been 4,110 claims processed and 3,833 paid. The total value of the TAPS payments is &euro;57,070,864.</p><p>The Scheme's guidelines and associated documentation are publicly available at <i></i>.</p><p>The core concept of the scheme is that the State will provide additional funding to those nursing homes that require it, to contribute towards support measures associated with COVID-19 preparedness, mitigation and outbreak management. There is an overall monthly funding cap, which is the maximum amount that may be paid in respect of each month to a Nursing Home under the scheme. </p><p>Where a nursing home applies for an assistance payment through the scheme, the nursing home may only claim for those additional allowable costs, as set out in the Scheme details. The nursing home must vouch that all amounts claimed are  in relation to those allowable costs arising as a result of the impact of COVID-19. In some cases, where an outbreak has been experienced and a claim is made under the outbreak assistance component of the scheme, the claim requires independently certified verification.</p><p>The HSE administers the scheme and makes payments to nursing homes. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) administers the application process and provides support and advice to the HSE. Regular reports of Scheme activity, including claims and payments, are produced and monitored by the HSE and submitted to the Department. External Auditors were appointed in April 2020 to perform audits of a sample of TAPS claims submitted each month by nursing homes to assess compliance with the scheme guidelines. </p><p>The scheme is under continuous review and engagement with the sector is ongoing.</p></reply>

There is a range of supports in place including specific agri-taxation measures to incentivise this generational change. The agri-taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers include 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers and stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers.</p>  <p>  Under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, there is also an enhanced capital investment Scheme for young trained farmers under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. This Scheme provides them with grant aid at a rate of 60% of the cost of the investment, compared to the standard grant rate of 40%, and I believe it is an important support and encouragement to young farmers starting in agriculture for the first time.</p>  <p>  Generational renewal continues to be a priority for my Department and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  My Department and I are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU on these issues during the current negotiations on new CAP proposals. We can then consider in more detail when we have the final EU Regulations as part of the wider consideration of all proposals for the next CAP.</p></reply>

My Department is furthermore working to develop a National Secure Veterinary Digital Prescription System which will address this knowledge gap and provide granular sector specific data to identify where the antibiotics are being used in line with requirements of Regulation EU 2019/6. </p>  <p>  The Department does, however, have access to reports from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) which collates data on overall antibiotic sales for the previous year - data is provided to the HPRA by the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) that market the various veterinary antibiotics. This provides a high level overview of antibiotic usage in animals in Ireland. The data provided covers both the farmed animal and companion animal sectors. The most recent HPRA report relates to sales of veterinary antibiotics in Ireland in 2019. The sales figures for 2020 will not be available until Q4 2021 due to a lag period between sales occurring and reporting of sales data to the HPRA from MAHs. </p>  <p>  These reports detail the total amount of veterinary antibiotics sold in Ireland - in 2018, total sales were 99.4 tons, of which premixes incorporated into compound feed accounted for 29 tons which represents 29.2% of overall sales. Premixes describe those antibiotics that are presented for incorporation into feed. </p>  <p>  In 2019, 88.8 tons of veterinary antibiotics were sold and premixes accounted for 32 tons or 37% of the overall total. Although there was an increase in the tonnage of premixes sold in 2019 overall, the 2019 HPRA report showed a significant reduction in sales of antibiotics on the previous year. The data available provides the overall volume of veterinary antibiotics sold in Ireland in a given year, but not sector specific usage data.  </p>  <p>  One of the key factors in reducing antibiotic use is improvement in animal health. My Department continues to fund research that focuses on disease prevention and other ways of reducing the overall usage of antibiotics in the pig sector. Farming and veterinary stakeholders on the iNAP Animal Health Sector Committee have worked together to develop a &ldquo;Code of Good Practice for the Responsible use of Antibiotics' guidelines for various sectors. These guidelines provide a valuable reference for farmers as they work with their veterinary practitioner to reduce their overall level of antibiotic use.  </p>  <p>  My Department had adopted a &ldquo;One Health One Welfare&rdquo; approach and the recently launched National Farmed Animal Bio security Strategy outlines key measures in the overall approach to reducing the use of antibiotics through improved animal health thereby address the public health threat of AMR.</p></reply>

This worklist of approximately 2,000 files is being dealt with by means of a dedicated project plan which was shared with the stakeholders on its publication in July.</p>  <p>  Generally, the remainder of licence applications that do not require an appropriate assessment are not subject to the delays currently being experienced with licences requiring ecology input. </p>  <p>  To date this year, my Department has issued 2,042 licences. 550 of these licences have issued since the introduction of the new Forestry legislation at the beginning of October. </p>  <p>  My Department's overall approach to tackling the backlog of applications is subject to continuous improvement and review with the aim of increasing the output of licences on a weekly basis.  At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on the backlog of applications referred to ecology but this figure is now sixteen.  Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.  This delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year. While this still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week.   </p></reply>

The Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) launched in June this year focuses on ash plantation management. This approach categorises plantations in to three groups based on the plantation age and tree size. Different support options are available, depending on the category into which the ash plantation may fall.</p><p>The objectives of the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) are to encourage the active management of ash plantations in the context of the control and spread of the disease.  The scheme aims to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning to realise as much potential value of the crop as possible and where appropriate in young plantations and in cases of high disease infection, to support the removal of the affected ash crop and replacement with alternative species.</p><p>Depending on the age and tree size of the ash plantation, the reconstitution option allows for the entire site to be cleared and replanted with an alternative species. Support available for this option covers the cost of establishment and includes a site clearance grant. The underplanting option is also available where a percentage of the crop is retained while the remainder is cleared to make way for planting a new crop of trees.  The Woodland Improvement Scheme may also be an option for some forest owners impacted by ash dieback.  This scheme supports two thinning interventions. Transitioning to Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) is also available which consists of three separate interventions. </p><p>My Department has received around 200 applications and there are no plans to amend it or to introduce additional supports.</p><p>As regards the background to the assessment and monitoring of the disease, following the first confirmed finding of  Ash Dieback disease in October 2012, on imported trees used in forestry plantations, intensive surveys for the disease have been conducted year on year since. The surveys conducted in 2019 included a targeted survey of forestry plantations and a systematic survey of National Forest Inventory points across the country. </p><p>By the end of 2019, there had been findings in ash in over 650 locations in various settings &ndash; forests, nurseries and garden centres, on farm planting, roadside planting, hedgerows and private gardens in all 26 counties. In 2019, due to the wide distribution of Chalara Ash Dieback Disease reports of the disease from the general public in non-grant aided ash trees, for example garden trees and hedgerow trees, were not routinely sampled for laboratory analysis and are not accounted for in the figure of 650. Systematic surveys for ash dieback have continued during 2020.</p><p>The Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into the control and management of Ash Dieback disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance. In this regard, a five-year project was begun in 2013, the aim of which has been to identify individual trees of ash which show tolerance to Ash Dieback and to use them for possible future breeding work and DNA screening by other institutes. </p><p>The project, which was part funded by the Department, was carried out by Forest Research, an agency of the Forestry Commission in the UK. The project involves 48 hectares of trial plantings over fourteen sites in the east of England and the mass screening of some 155,000 ash trees with fifteen different provenances from continental Europe, the UK and Ireland.  Over 14,000 Irish ash plants from two distinct seed lots were included in the trials. These trials continue to be monitored by Forest Research, while scion material showing early signs of tolerance has been repatriated back to Ireland and incorporated into the Teagasc research effort.  </p><p>The Department continues to closely follow similar work in Europe. Teagasc has collaborated with a number of European research agencies and has acquired and propagated ash genotypes which have been selected as putatively tolerant to ash dieback disease, having been observed as healthy over several years in infected locations with high tree mortality.</p><p>In 2020, with support from this Department under the Forest Genetic Resources Reproductive Material: Seed Stand &amp;amp; Seed Orchard, a collaboration between Teagasc and Coillte resulted in the establishment of the first conservation collection of putatively tolerant ash plants at a forest site in Co. Kilkenny. This planting will be monitored over the coming years in order to assess how tolerance of each genotype holds up.</p><p>Also in 2020, officials in this Department contributed to a COFORD Connect Note on ash dieback disease. This note provides a comprehensive background on the state of the disease in Ireland,  and a strategy for generating sources of tolerant ash seeds and plants, and for mobilising this material for field planting.

Even though a fungus causes the disease, it spreads due to the action of bark beetles, which carry fungal spores allowing the fungus to infect new trees.</p><p>Wych elm (<i>Ulmus glabra</i>) is the only native elm species in Ireland and is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease.  Once a very abundant tree in the Irish landscape, it is uncommon to find living mature elm trees nowadays. Even though there is natural resistance to the disease within elm populations, it is extremely rare. Most living elms are thought to have been able to &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; the insect rather than being resistant to the disease and those that have survived occur mainly in semi-natural woodland and in hedges in a range of localities around the island. A significant percentage of the mature elm trees in Ireland occur in urban areas where pollution, traffic, buildings and management of parks and gardens protect elm trees from getting in contact with the bark beetles that carry Dutch elm disease.</p><p>Teagasc samples of mature elm trees growing in Ireland with a view to propagating them vegetatively as a first step to creating a collection of candidate elm genotypes for screening for resistance to Dutch elm disease. The candidate elms must be older than 40 years or have a diameter larger than 45 cm. In addition, neighbouring elms must show recent signs of the disease. These requirements are used to confirm that the trees are old enough to get infected and that the disease is active in the area.  Teagasc continues to ask the public to notify them when an elm tree fulfilling these requirements is identified.  Elm is not on the Department&rsquo;s list of accepted tree species for the afforestation scheme but the Department is supportive of actions that can lead to the conservation of elm under its Native Woodland Conservation scheme.  </p></reply>

This plan will be developed in partnership between the Department of Health and my Department. </p><p>From my Department's perspective, this will see an increased focus on capturing usage data, seeking to influence human behavioural changes needed to reduce AMU and interrupting those usage patterns which are the main drivers of antibiotic usage (AMU)  on farms in Ireland. </p><p>My Department is focused on  developing a National Secure Veterinary Digital Prescription System to collect prescription level usage data. As well as meeting a strategic objective under <i>i</i>NAP, this project reflects the requirements of EU Regulations 2019/6. It is currently envisaged that the usage data will be gathered from prescribing vets, with the plan to allow for real time recording of all medicines being used in food producing animals. </p><p>The recently published HPRA report on sales of veterinary antibiotics in Ireland in 2019 (published last week)  shows a noteworthy reduction in the overall sales of veterinary antibiotics, with reductions in several classes of antibiotics noted. Most importantly, sales of the highest priority critically important antibiotics were also reduced. This report is a tangible sign that the collaborative efforts of the farming and veterinary stakeholders who sit on the <i>i</i>NAP Animal Health Sector Committee are having the desired effect of reducing the level of antibiotics being used in our animals.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on AMR, in common with the current plan, will, in addition to a range of issues in the human medicine field, have as a primary objective the improvement of animal health, thus reducing the need for antimicrobial use.

The actions will also be extended to include the companion animal and equine sector as well as further work on awareness raising, farm biosecurity and animal health programmes. This second One Health national action plan will build on the strong platform created through collaborative actions already taken to sustainably address the issue of AMR.</p></reply>

The President of the European Commission has made the European Green Deal a priority for her mandate from the start and it includes raising the EU's ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 and is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2&deg;C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5&deg;C.  </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s focus is on overhauling relevant climate and energy legislation to align with the newly proposed target to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels.  The 'step-up' in ambition at national level will be subject to agreement through a revision to the 'Effort Sharing regulation' which will not be concluded until the middle of 2021.</p><p>At national level, it is not yet clear what this will mean for individual sectors.  However, it is clear that, as a result of the Green Deal and the Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies, there is an increasing focus on achieving positive environmental outcomes in Agriculture.</p><p>Ireland's farmers are well placed to deliver on this objective giver our reputation as a source of high quality food produced to the highest environmental standards. Farmers can also embrace these changes in the knowledge that much of what is being asked of them can contribute to improving overall farm profitability, and that there are strong synergies between environmental performance and market dynamics  <b>.</b></p></reply>

These delays have arisen because of  significant changes introduced in the Department's appropriate assessment process, as a result of European Court of Justice cases and their subsequent interpretation by the courts and the Forestry Appeals Committee.  </p>  <p>  My Department's overall approach to tackling the backlog of applications is subject to continuous improvement and review with the aim of increasing the output of licences on a weekly basis.  At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on the backlog of applications referred to ecology but this figure is now sixteen.  Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.  </p>  <p>  This delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year. While this still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week.   </p>  <p>  I am taking the current issues in the forestry sector extremely seriously.

CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution towards the wages cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and a manager, where warranted. It does not provide funding towards capital costs as outlined in the Deputy's question. In addition, the organisation in question is not currently supported under the CSP. </p>  <p>  Funding may be available for the project referenced by the Deputy, through the LEADER Programme. LEADER is delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country. Funding is provided under a broad range of themes.  The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the LAG which administers the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partner to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups.</p>  <p>  The project may also be eligible for funding under the Community Enhancement Programme.  The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m providing small capital grants to community organisations was launched in June.  Separately, under the July stimulus package my Department launched a &euro;5m fund for repairs or upgrades to community centres and community buildings.  While it is now closed for 2020, it is hoped to run the CEP again in 2021.  Full details of the 2021 Scheme will issue to all Local Authorities when finalised.  </p></reply>
