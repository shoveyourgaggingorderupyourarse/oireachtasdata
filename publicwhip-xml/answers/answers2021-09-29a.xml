Progress includes:</p>  <p>  - The launch in April of Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration and commencement of development work on Phase 3, enabled by an allocation of &euro;7 million from the Shared Island Fund and &euro;5.8 million from the Rural Regeneration Development Fund; </p>  <p>  - The launch in April of the all-island strategic rail review jointly by the Minister for Transport and the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure; </p>  <p>  - In June, I was joined by the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, as I announced &euro;3m in funding from the Shared Island Fund to progress the Narrow Water Bridge to tender stage; and,</p>  <p>  - In July, I and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science announced the new North-South Research programme, with Government investing &euro;40 million from the Shared Island Fund over five years, to support the deepening of links between higher education institutions, researchers and research communities on the island. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to develop investment, policy and cooperation initiatives that enhance our shared island. The reviewed National Development Plan, to be published shortly, will set out a new level of ambition for collaborative cross-border investment out to 2030 with the goal of building a more connected, sustainable, and prosperous shared island for all.</p>  <p>  To support the Government&rsquo;s agenda for cooperation and connection on the island, the Shared Island unit in my Department has commissioned a comprehensive research programme, working with the ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council and other partners. Research will be published in the final quarter of this year and through 2022, focused on opportunities to deepen cooperation across a range of economic, social and environmental domains.</p>  <p>  In July, at the Labour Employer Economic Forum it was agreed to commence a workstream on Shared Island issues of interest for trade unions and employers within LEEFs remit of economic and employment issues relevant to the labour market.</p>  <p>  Finally, I initiated the Shared Island Dialogue series to foster inclusive civic dialogue, that engages all communities on the island, on our shared future. </p>  <p>  I addressed the first Shared Island Dialogue with young people in November. Dialogues on Climate and Environment; Civil Society engagement; Equality; Economic recovery on the island; and Health have been held this year, with participation by Government Ministers. </p>  <p>  The next Dialogue is on the future of Education on the island, taking place on 1 October with Ministerial participation and over 100 education stakeholders from North and South. </p>  <p>  The Dialogues are bringing together more than 1,000 civic representatives this year in different sectors and across all regions, communities and traditions, to discuss how we work together for a shared future on this island, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. </p></reply>

The EU has consistently said it is ready to find flexible, practical approaches to address the difficulties citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland are experiencing as regards the implementation of the Protocol.</p><p>However, any solutions must take place within the framework of the Protocol and the principles that underpin it.</p><p>We also exchanged views on the Covid-19 situation, especially in regard to the Delta variant.</p><p>I also raised legacy issues, including serious concerns at the British Government&rsquo;s proposals and the impact they would have on victims and families. I emphasised that there can be no pre-determined outcome to the consultation process currently underway.</p><p>We both looked forward to an opportunity to meet in person in the future.</p><p>Previously, I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Chequers on Friday 14th May.</p><p>On that occasion, our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North/South and East/West basis. We also discussed issues around implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p><p>The Prime Minister and I spoke about legacy issues, and of how best to secure progress and answers for the many families who have been pursuing truth and justice now for far too many years.</p><p>I was clear with the Prime Minister that every family bereaved in the conflict should have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement framework allows for the crucial elements we need &ndash; investigations, truth recovery, oral history, reconciliation and acknowledgement.</p></reply>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists. These lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.</p>  <p>  With effect from 2017, the occupation of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver has been eligible for a General Employment Permit, subject to a quota initially of 120 employment permits. In January 2020, this quota was increased to 320 in anticipation of the impact of Brexit on the sector and evidence of EEA-wide labour shortages. To date ,175 employment permits have issued to HGV drivers, leaving 145 permits remaining and available.</p>  <p>  My Department, working with the Department of Transport is keeping this matter under review. A review of the Occupation Lists is currently underway, with submissions received, including submissions from the HGV sector, under consideration.

Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, a pilot quota-based scheme was introduced to remove certain agri-food occupations from the ineligible occupations list. The scheme provided for 2,500 General Employment Permits for the meat processing industry, 500 for horticulture and 150 for the dairy sector to address the immediate needs of the sectors in sourcing labour. In addition, a quota of 300 permits was granted in respect of meat deboners. To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector. All quotas expired in December 2019. </p>  <p>  A review is currently underway with 26 submissions received, including from the meat and pig processing sectors, under consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised in early Autumn.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.</p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 17 September, over 257,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Kildare in Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown, Donaghcumper, Athy, Coneyboro, Aughaboura, Ballinapark, Castlemitchell, Bert, Kilberry, Kilkea, Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth. Areas which are close to the Wicklow border have commenced build works as part of the Blessington Deployment Area.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 September, 373 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Crookstown Further Education and Training and Community Centre (4.8km from premises), Bigstone Community Hall, and Lullymore Heritage Park. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-map/. </p>  <p>  Saint David's National School, Piper's Hill Campus, and Rathmore National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meeting increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres. This may include potential geographic restrictions or incentives to locate large demand customers closer to the generation of power, potentially giving a more regional balance of locations. Publication of the outcome of the consultation is expected this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, in June 2021, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a proposed Direction to the electricity system operators related to Data Centre grid connection, for consultation. This included a number of options for managing data centre connection demand. A final decision will be issued by the Regulator in due course.</p></reply>

This includes parcels/packages coming from the UK. While goods valued at less than &euro;150 may not be liable to a customs duty charge, since July 1st all goods imported to the Union, regardless of their value, are liable to VAT. It is important to emphasise that the rules apply to all non-EU country imports by economic operators in Ireland whether postal authority or otherwise. This is important in terms of ensuring a level competitive playing field between all economic operators. It is important to note that without a customs declaration, goods cannot be imported in compliance with the Union Customs Code.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that in the context of parcels and packages, while customs declarations are often submitted by the courier business or postal operator on behalf of the recipient (importer) in Ireland, the information required to complete the declaration is generally supplied by the exporting party although the importer (the recipient in Ireland) may also provide information to the postal operator or courier business that is needed to complete the declaration. Where the postal operator or courier business does not have the necessary information, it may contact the exporting party or the importer to gather the necessary information to enable them to complete the declaration. This highlights the challenge for each economic operator and the importance of each economic operator considering and examining their supply chain to ensure that they are in possession of the necessary information to enable timely and accurate completion of the customs declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the customs declaration in not available, the postal operator or courier business may choose to return the goods to the sender. It is a matter for the relevant postal operator or courier business to determine, based on its business model, how to deal with instances where they do not have the data needed to complete the necessary customs declaration. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Revenue provided extensive guidance and assistance on the customs rules and requirements, particularly leading up to and after 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, to both businesses and consumers and also followed this up with relevant advice and information relating to the changes that came into effect from the 1st of July last. I know that Revenue works very closely with individual businesses that may be experiencing particular challenges in meeting their customs obligations in order to assist the businesses in understanding what is required and I know that Revenue is fully committed to continuing that collaborative and positive engagement with affected businesses.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.844 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;769 million have been granted to 51,400 employers in respect of 660,400 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government decided on 1 June to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>  Further, as announced yesterday, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the scheme beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

This arrangement, which is included under &lsquo;payment options&rsquo; on both the paper and online versions of the LPT Return, clearly references the three approved providers and is available to more than 1.2 million (87%) of the 1.4 million property owners listed on the LPT Register. </p>  <p>  The arrangements are slightly different for approximately 180,000 (13%) owners of more than one residential property in that they are required to meet their LPT filing and payment obligations electronically, in accordance with Section 44 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended). As such, use of the third-party service providers is not an option for them. However, they can still avail of a wide variety of payment options, which are set out on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

Separately, the Level II Regulatory Technical Standards were approved by Council and published in March 2021. Accordingly, the Regulation will enter into application in Quarter 1 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department had domestic responsibility for negotiating this file and has engaged with key domestic stakeholders such as the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Authority, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as part of the negotiation process. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing within my Department on the necessary transposition work with a view to completing the work within the time-frame. The first PEPP products may be expected to come to the market in 2022. Providers and distributors will follow the normal approval process through the relevant national authorities to ensure they  and their products comply with the necessary requirements. </p>  <p>  The objective of the PEPP is to lay the foundations for a safer, more cost-efficient and transparent market in affordable and voluntary personal pension savings that can be managed on a pan-European scale. It is envisaged that the PEPP framework will constitute a complementary voluntary scheme alongside national regimes. </p>  <p>  It is far too early to say what the impact of the PEPP will have on the pensions market but the PEPP may introduce greater competition in the pension market if European providers offer the PEPP to Irish savers on a cross-border basis. This in turn should help lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers.</p></reply>

Payments made from the traveller specific accommodation budget over the last 24 months in respect of construction projects would not give a reliable indication of average costs as they may not include all payments from initiation to completion in respect of a sufficient quantity of projects to provide a reliable average cost. </p>  <p>  Average costs can however be provided for the last 24 months in respect of the acquisition of homes and the provision of mobiles and caravans. In 2019 the average cost for completed acquisitions was &euro;339,750 and in 2020 it was &euro;228,833. It should be borne in mind that the number of acquisitions is relatively small and the average can vary widely from year to year depending upon the number of acquisitions and the size and location of the homes acquired.</p>  <p>  In respect of the provision of emergency mobiles/caravans the average cost to my Department was &euro;9,947 in 2019 and &euro;12,662 in 2020. This however only represents 50% of the actual average cost as local authorities fund 50% of the cost under the emergency replacement scheme. In respect of mobiles/caravans provided during the Covid emergency response, my Department funded 100% of the costs of the provision of mobiles/caravans (including associated costs) and the average cost was &euro;22,180.</p></reply>

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, buying and leasing new social housing units. </p><p>The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the establishment of the Housing Agency Acquisition Fund and the Mortgage to Rent scheme. My Department can provide CALF funding of up to 30% or up to 40% in the case of the Mortgage to Rent scheme for eligible projects, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings to which the local authorities are not party.  All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available. </p><p>My Department does not hold information on the loan agreements under CALF, as the loan agreement, is between the local authority and the relevant AHB.  Accordingly, information on the number and value of CALF loans, including the balance owning, is held by the relevant local authorities. The value and term of each loan varies by project.</p><p>The following table shows the 2020 delivery and expenditure to Local Authorities by my Department.</p><p><b>2020 delivery supported by CALF Funding</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Delivery Stream</b></th>       <th><b>Units</b></th>       <th><b> Expenditure</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b> AHB -MTR</b></td>       <td>117</td>       <td>&euro;6.697m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>AHB CALF(incl HAA)</b></td>       <td>2549</td>       <td>&euro;190.22m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The total budgetary allocation for CALF for 2021 is &euro;220m of which &euro;137.8m had been administered to Local Authorities by the end of August. In addition the 2021 budgetary allocation for the Mortgage to Rent scheme is &euro;23m which also includes provision for the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that owing to the nature of the CALF, delivery of new housing does not always arise in the same year as expenditure and projects delivered under phased programmes may cross a number of payment periods. </p><p>Details of the 2021 funding provision for CALF and MTR and related output target are set out in the 2021 Revised Estimates (REV) which is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/e20037-revised-estimates/#2021  </p><p>Accelerating the delivery of social housing, with an increased emphasis on direct build is a key objective for my Department, and the Housing For All strategy contains an ambitious target of delivering more than 90,000 social homes to 2030.</p></reply>

The annual targets include the delivery of 88,400 new social homes and 53,800 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030.   </p>  <p>  Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) will have a significant role in the delivery of new housing under Housing for All.  Under Housing for All, local authorities are required to prepare Housing Delivery Action Plans, to set out details of social and affordable housing to be delivered in the five-year period 2022-2026.  AHBs will be key delivery partners in the delivery of new homes under these action plans.   </p>  <p>  A new strengthened regulatory regime for AHBs has also been put in place. The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) was formally established on 1 February 2021. A key role of AHBRA is to encourage and facilitate the better governance, administration and management including corporate governance and financial management, of AHBs.</p></reply>

We will continue to proactively raise these issues at EU level, in national and EU statements, at the UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council, and in our bilateral contacts. </p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process remains a key priority for Ireland during our term on the Security Council. Ireland engages actively in monthly meetings on the situation in the Middle East. I addressed meetings of the Council on this issue in January and May this year. As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council this month, I chaired a dialogue between the Security Council and the League of Arab States on 22 September, during which I underlined the need for strong regional engagement on the MEPP and a reinvigoration of the political track, which is vital to advance peace. I had further discussions on the MEPP in my bilateral meetings with Foreign Ministers last week at the UN. </p>  <p>  This week, Ireland is chairing the Council&rsquo;s monthly meeting on the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question. This meeting will focus on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which includes the issue of illegal settlements, violence against civilians and de-escalation and reversal of negative trends on the ground. </p>  <p>  I have been clear in my engagement with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the commitment of this Government to advancing a two-State solution for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.</p></reply>

In my address to the Council on 16 May, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at the plight of children in the occupied Palestinian territory. I stressed that all violations against children must end, including and in particular attacks on schools. In the Council's meeting on 30 August, Ireland called for an end to attacks against civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory and for those responsible to be held to account. Ireland has repeatedly emphasised that the rights of children to protection, safety, and well-being must be upheld at all times.</p>  <p>  I fully endorse the statement of 9 September 2021 by European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, on the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, which underlined that attacks on education constitute violations of International Humanitarian Law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of education for Palestinian youth, which is crucial for the long-term viability of a Palestinian state. Ireland is a longstanding supporter of UNRWA&rsquo;s delivery of services, including quality education, to 5.7 million registered Palestine refugees.</p>  <p>  This year, Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million to UNRWA, including &euro;1 million in additional emergency support in response to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip in May. Ireland also provided &euro;500,000 to UNICEF for the provision of essential supplies and services to thousands of children in acute need in the West Bank and in Gaza and &euro;300,000 to the oPt Humanitarian Fund, which can be drawn upon to respond to humanitarian emergencies and has been utilised for the education sector.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the Palestinian Ministry of Education in providing equitable access to quality education for children.  </p>  <p>  Irish officials will continue to engage actively on the ground and by supporting Israeli and Palestinian civil society partners who play a critical role on this issue.</p></reply>

In addition to the Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard and private air ambulance operators also provide air transport services for the HSE. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Government Decision, which established on a permanent basis, the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service approved an additional annual provision of &euro;2.2 million to the Defence Vote for reimbursement of Air Corps&rsquo; costs incurred in the provision of the service. The Health Vote is reduced accordingly. This sum is based on 480 flying hours per annum and is subject to periodic costs review. This sum also takes into consideration average fuel and Air Corps personnel costs. Any annual flying hours in excess of 480 hours are charged to the HSE separately by the Department of Defence at a rate of &euro;3,180 per hour. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost of ancillary costs directly related to the operation of the EAS service since July 2015 is approximately &euro;700,000. These costs include items such as maintenance of the hangar in Custume Barracks and have been borne between the Defence Vote and the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Personnel costs associated with NAS personnel are borne by the HSE and are not reflected in the &euro;2.2 million figure. </p></reply>

All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students are also in place.  However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Department of Education website has guidelines (including checklists) and FAQs on exemptions from the study of Irish which can be accessed here: www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Irish-Exemption  </p>  <p>  The Primary Language Curriculum (PLC), which encompasses Irish and English, is for children of all abilities in all school contexts. This is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils that underpin curricular provision for Irish in the PLC, the Framework for Junior Cycle and in Senior Cycle.  The PLC recognises and supports pupils&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. It builds on the language knowledge and experience that pupils bring to the school. The Progression Continua in the PLC provide a framework for teachers to identify the pupil&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages.   </p>  <p>  Any pupil who does not meet the criteria for an exemption from the study of Irish should be provided with a differentiated approach to language learning and any other supports in accordance with Guidelines for supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools and with Special Educational Needs: A continuum of Support.    Schools are required to address a wide diversity of needs by providing a differentiated learning experience for pupils/students in an inclusive school environment. </p>  <p>  All pupils/students should be encouraged to study the language and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their ability.  </p>  <p>  As set out in Section 2.4 of the Circular, an appeal will &ldquo;focus solely on the process the school engaged in reaching its decision. The Irish Exemptions Appeal Committee will consider how the school followed the process as prescribed in this Circular and the accompanying Guidelines for Primary Schools&rdquo;.   </p>  <p>  The closure of schools in response to the risk to health caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of the entire cohort of children attending school, it is a matter which schools should take into account in planning the education provision for students over the next few years.  The Department has provided guidance in relation to pupils who enrolled from abroad for the first time into 5th and 6th class during 2019/20 and into 6th class during 2020 and who are applying for an exemption from the study of Irish under Section 2.2.a. of Circular 0053/2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to stress and anxiety, schools can best promote the wellbeing of pupils through a multi-component, preventative, whole school approach. In line with best practice, The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) encourages schools to adopt a whole school, continuum of support  approach to provide for children and young people&rsquo;s wellbeing needs. This involves three levels: Support for All, Support for Some and Support for Few. </p>  <p>  The area of wellbeing and the promotion of positive mental health is one to which the Department of Education affords particular priority. In this regard the department is committed to responding to the challenges our young people face today and their need for education in the area of wellbeing and stress. The department has published a Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools to promote student wellbeing using a holistic and integrated approach. It is important to point out that schools are already doing a lot to equip children with the knowledge, skills and competencies to enhance their wellbeing and deal with challenges. The Wellbeing Policy builds on this good work.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the Circulars, the Department is currently planning an initial review of the Circulars following two years of implementation.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management receive an application for admission and they make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  Where a parent has been refused admission to a school and wishes to appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 the appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if admission has been refused due to the school being oversubscribed, and a parent wishes to appeal this decision she or he must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  If the parent has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, she or he may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.  Where admission has been refused for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and the parent does not wish to seek a review by the board of management she or he may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals processes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/  </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/  </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), the Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

The draft plan contains information concerning projected populations in the various settlements of the county.  The Department&rsquo;s submission assessed projected future school place requirements at each settlement and how they can best be met. It took account of planned school capacity increases as well as underlying demographic trends at both primary and post-primary levels Based on all factors, a view was formed concerning projected future requirements and how they can best be met at each settlement.  The Department&rsquo;s submission is in the public domain on the website of Dun-Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p></reply>

Separately, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility in terms of capital provision for the development of new refuges.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) sets out signatory obligations but does not set out a standard or recommended number of refuges. A policy document "Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services", published by the Council of Europe, references two possible standards depending on the types of service provision in place. Tusla has applied the standard of one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population, with specific mechanisms for measuring population and calculation of shelter spaces. This standard applied by Tusla, reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; has been completed. Minister Naughton and I brought an Information Memorandum to the Government in July, outlining that this Review will present recommendations on the future configuration of accommodation and services that may be required to holistically meet the needs of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  We agreed that the recommendations of the Review will be discussed and actions agreed towards future investment in refuge provision as part of the Third National Strategy on DSGBV, which is due to be published later this year. </p>  <p>  The Review was also presented to the Monitoring Committee for the National Strategy on the 23rd September, with a view to achieving a national consensus with the NGO sector on Ireland&rsquo;s response to these needs. Any decisions with regard to developing or funding new services will be made in accordance with the findings of the Review and these engagements.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible. I remain committed to working with all stakeholders to develop the required infrastructure for DSGBV policy and services to be dealt with in as efficient a manner as possible.</p></reply>

The primary requirement is that room leaders in the ECCE programme should have a relevant Bachelor&rsquo;s degree (level 7 or higher on the National Framework of Qualifications). A Focused Policy Assessment of the ECCE Higher Capitation Payment published in 2020 noted the positive impact of this financial incentive in promoting professionalisation. For example, the overall proportion of staff working in early learning and care (ELC) services with a qualification at Level 7 or higher more than doubled from 13% at end 2013 to almost 27% by May 2020.</p>  <p>  The Focused Policy Assessment also identified challenges of the Higher Capitation payment, including its limitation to staff delivering the ECCE programme. First 5 (the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families) commits to a graduate-led ELC workforce, with graduates in room leader roles with young children of all ages, not just in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. Nevertheless, I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in early learning and childcare services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. </p>  <p>  In December 2020, I began a short process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the sector, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, and on foot of the recommendation of the report by the independent chair of the &ldquo;Pre-JLC&rdquo; process, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and this recommendation in turn was accepted by the Minister for Business, Employment and Retail. The Establishment Order came in to effect on 1 July. A JLC could lead to an Employment Regulation Order, which would establish binding rates of pay and conditions for the sector.</p>  <p>  Work is also progressing on a new funding model. The recommendations of a dedicated Expert Group are due later in 2021 and will be central to addressing both affordability and quality issues. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services.</p>  <p>  Finally, work on the Workforce Development Plan continues, with a final report expected by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The broader skills ecosystem also encompasses entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU, hosted in SOLAS), the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) and the National Training Fund Advisory Group (NTFAG, DFHERIS). While DFHERIS has responsibility for skills policy, this broader skills ecosystem informs and drives responsive, flexible forecasting, planning, and provision. </p>  <p>  In terms of supporting learners to develop skills and achieve relevant qualifications to support the industries set out below, there are a wide range of programmes available across the further education and training and the higher education sectors to support the agri-machinery field.  Examples include work based learning through traineeship (HGV Professional Driver Traineeship, Welding Fabrication Traineeship) or apprenticeship (see below) and the general further and higher education programmes from welding and motor technology to electronic engineering.  </p>  <p>  Eight of the ten occupations listed are craft apprentice occupations. Apprenticeship is a demand driven, employer-led offering based on a contract of employment between the apprentice and their respective employer. Therefore the number of apprentices in any specific sector is determined directly by employer provision.  Recognising the importance of these occupations to the economy and the opportunity offered by apprenticeship to support economic recovery, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme (AIS) was launched in March 2020 to support employers to continue to recruit apprentices during the COVID-19 period.  The establishment, funding and success of the scheme is a strong demonstration of  the Government's commitment to the development and growth of apprenticeship in Ireland, which will be sustained and intensified through the implementation of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship.  In addition to the existing apprenticeships, a Commercial Driver Apprenticeship is in development and due to be launched shortly.  </p>  <p>  The closure of face to face training in education and training institutions resulted in a backlog of off-the-job training delivery for craft apprentices in phases 2,4 and 6 of their seven phase apprenticeship. SOLAS and the HEA have been working with education and training providers to agree a significant response which commenced in September and will clear the waiting lists by April 2022 for phase 4 and 6 and by year end 2022 for phase 2 apprentices.  An update issued on www.apprenticeship.ie on 23rd September.  Published minimum entry requirements for apprenticeship include an age restriction and academic entry requirements &ndash; apprentices must be aged 16 years or over and must hold a junior cycle certificate or equivalent or have relevant experience.  The actual entry requirements to access to employment may be higher than the minimum entry requirements and are set by employers in accordance with the level of education or experience required to deliver the role effectively in the workplace.  Apprenticeship qualifications range from QQI level 5-10, with a number of programmes requiring post-school level qualifications and experience as entry requirements.</p>  <p>  General expansion of apprenticeship as a route to career development is a key priority for Government.  As such, an Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was published in April of this year which sets out a strategic approach to broadening the visibility of apprenticeship as an opportunity for school leavers and career changers.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The scheme is demand led and as such the numbers applying each year can change for reasons such as demographics, employment rates etc.   The budgetary provision for the Student Grant Scheme in 2021 is  &euro;364.5M, plus &euro;9.05M to cover SUSI administrative costs.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which is expected to support circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In July 2021, as part of the &euro;21 million of extra supports for students in further and higher education, an additional &euro;10 million in financial support to students in financial difficulties while in higher education. This will be mainly made available through the Student Assistance Fund.   This Department is working closely with the Higher Education Authority regarding the best way for disbursing the funds to the Higher Education Institutions to ensure students who find themselves in a financial situation are supported.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. The 2021 allocation to the fund is &euro;7.658m which supports circa 14,000 students. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanism that supports the implementation of the current National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (NAP) 2015 - 2021.  There are three strands of the PATH fund and the 2021 allocation for the fund is just over &euro;9m.</p></reply>

A number of factors are exacerbating the problem this year including houses previously rented to students being rented to year-round tenants, a reluctance by people to rent rooms in their houses to students due to Covid concerns, and higher education institutions in general not offering shared rooms this year. </p>  <p>  In the context of significant unmet demand for student accommodation, I was extremely disappointed to see the recent granting by Local Authorities of "Change of Use" permissions to allow privately-owned purpose built student accommodation be used for other purposes. This runs contrary to the Student Accommodation Strategy.

This includes the current second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II). </p>  <p>  SIS II is a centralised secure database used by European countries for maintaining information (alerts) related to border security and law enforcement and is a critical component of the open border policy that has been operating in Europe. The integration of SIS II into national systems means that automatic alerts are generated in real-time in instances where, for example, a Garda member encounters a person who is wanted or has been involved in a serious crime in another jurisdiction. SIS II also generates alerts on missing persons (in particular children), as well as information on certain types of property, such as banknotes, vehicles, firearms and identity documents that may have been stolen, misappropriated or lost.</p>  <p>  Ireland's participation in SIS is not impacted by Brexit, although unfortunately as the Deputy will appreciate, the UK no longer participates in SIS II as a consequence of its departure from the EU.  </p>  <p>  On 15 September last, the Garda Commissioner and I welcomed six months of Ireland&rsquo;s successful connection to SIS II, which occurred on 15 March 2021.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in the first six months of operation, there have been 74 arrests on SIS Article 26 (Alerts on Persons Wanted for Arrest for Surrender or Extradition Purposes) and 52 Arrests on already endorsed European Arrest Warrants for offences including drug trafficking, robbery, sexual assault, burglary, theft, assault causing harm, fraud and property offences. This is double the corresponding figures for the same six months in 2020. </p>  <p>  I am very pleased with the progress Ireland has made since connecting to SIS II six months ago. These numbers demonstrate the positive impact SIS II has had on the investigation of trans-European crime to date, with a significant increase in the number of arrests for a large number of crime types.</p></reply>

This includes processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes. </p>  <p>  Processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes is subject to Part 5 of the Data Protection Act 2018. Section 69(1) of the Act defines a data controller as a competent authority that, whether alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. </p>  <p>  As a competent authority for law enforcement with functions established under Section 7(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the data controller for personal data processed by it for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, including personal data processed under the new Garda Operating Model. </p>  <p>  Under the overall responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, all members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must abide by relevant policies and procedures in respect of the processing of personal data. This includes the commitment, under the Code of Ethics for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to gather, retain, access, disclose of process information only in accordance with the law and principles of data protection. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that both currently and under the new Garda Operating Model, the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) has primary responsibility for the input and collection of crime incident data, working with Garda members to ensure that data on every incident is centrally recorded consistently and accurately.</p>  <p>  In compliance with data protection legislation, the Data Protection Officer (DPO) is a Principal Officer position in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reporting to the Executive Director, Chief Information Officer. I am informed that the role is currently filled on an acting basis with a permanent appointment due to be made at the conclusion of a dedicated open competition in October, 2021. The Data Protection Commissioner was formally notified of the appointment of the current DPO in line with the provisions of Article 37(7) of the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR, EU 2016/679) and Section 88(4)(b) of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  I am also deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  All naturalisation applications, whether they are made by EU citizens or non-EU citizens, are processed entirely in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment or nationality of the applicant. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  The fees in relation to applications for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 and have not increased in the past ten years notwithstanding that considerable investments has taken place including a new website and an e-payments facility. </p>  <p>  The fees are in two parts - the current application fee is &euro;175, payable when an application for naturalisation is lodged; and a certification fee which is payable, only when the application is successful, and a certificate of naturalisation issues. </p>  <p>  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons, there is no certification fee.  </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process.  </p>  <p>  There is no provision for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for different fees to be applied. All of fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, are kept under ongoing review by my Department. However, there are currently no plans to amend the fees.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended and pay the appropriate fees.</p></reply>

It is intended to progress to 7 day extended hours working on an incremental basis during 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.   The Contractor for the construction of the new Cath Lab at University Hospital Waterford (UHW) was formally appointed on 25th March 2021. The project commenced on 17th May 2021 with a 13 month works programme. The project could not commence earlier due to levels of Covid Infection presenting at UHW. </p>  <p>  It is expected the main Contractor will hand over the project by the end of June 2022. Equipping and commissioning will follow for a period of 2 months and the Cath Lab is expected to be available for operational use from September 2022 onwards.</p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services at UHW should cease to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The then Minister for Health asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on its progress. Work has now recommenced on the Review to progress this over the coming months. As part of this, the Steering Group, under the Chairship of Prof Philip Nolan, has reconvened and a meeting was held on 20th September. </p>  <p>  As the issues raised in the deputy&rsquo;s question are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the current Programme for Government, the new policy, Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, and the significant additional funding given to HSE Mental Health services in Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in relation to the 2022 Estimates. Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. However, I am committed to ensuring the continued enhancement of mental health services through the allocation of additional development funding in mental health in 2022. </p>  <p>  I would note for the Deputy that 2021 saw a record budget for mental health of over &euro;1.1 billion, including &euro;23 million to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision in 2021 and the HSE National Service Plan. &euro;15m is to address the additional challenges posed by Covid-19, including increased step-down beds, private surge capacity, extra resources for community mental health teams and reconfiguration of residential facilities to meet Mental Health Commission recommendations. An additional &euro;2.2m was allocated in 2020 to develop telehealth and psychosocial responses to Covid-19 for healthcare workers and the public.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;23 million allocated to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision in 2021, &euro;8.737 million has been released to the HSE. This funding has enabled the HSE to progress initiatives agreed in the National Service Plan 2021 and Sharing the Vision, including crisis resolution teams, peer support programme, individual placement support, development of the national clinical programmes, the recently launched DBT training programme and the recruitment of a bereavement co-ordinator under Connecting for Life, the National Strategy to Reduce Suicide. The remaining MH posts provided for under 2021 development funding will continue to be progressed in Q4 2021</p>  <p>  While we do not yet fully understand Covid-19&rsquo;s impact on mental health, the extent of supports that may be required and how this will affect longer term service demand the Department and HSE continue to plan for any potential surge in demand as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity. The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, with adaptations, enhancements and improvements, mental health services continued to operate to approximately 85-90% capacity. In particular, expanded and enhanced digital services were crucial in responding to both existing and new and emerging need.</p></reply>

These traditionally include respite, convalescent, rehabilitation, assessment and palliative care beds.  In recent years transitional care beds have been made available in areas where acute hospitals are experiencing service pressures with delayed transfers of care. These beds have proved to be extremely effective for easing pressures on the acute hospital services and facilitating the planning and management of older peoples&rsquo; health needs in a more appropriate environment.  As outlined in the National Service Plan for 2021,  funding in the order of &euro;125m has been provided by the Department of Health for an additional 1,110 rehabilitation and short stay/intermediate care beds in 2021.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of a reduction of long term residential care beds, the HSE recognises the importance of providing a quality service experience for residents even in the challenging environment of ageing infrastructure where many of our public units are between 100 &ndash; 150 years old. In order to fully address this challenge and to bring all of its units to the required HIQA and legislative standards, the HSE, with the support of the Department of Health, are working through a systematic programme of development through the Community Nursing Unit Programme.   </p>  <p>  The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the timeline for the implementation of the CNU Programme. However, it has also provided an opportunity to incorporate some of the learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic, including the recommendations of the Nursing Home Expert Panel Report into the overall Reform Programme. The current programme of works provides for nearly 90% compliance by the end of 2024 with the remaining 11 projects being completed in 2025.    </p>  <p>  A key priority of the 2021 HSE Service Plan is to implement the recommendations of the Covid-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report and to progress the overall reform and development of both residential care and home support services to ensure that a wider range of options are available within the community in supporting older people. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the requirement for enhanced infection control measures together with the necessity to improve compliance with HIQA standards there has been a reduction in the order of over 240 long stay beds in the service with a further 10 beds to be reduced during 2021.   </p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to support older people and their families across the health service to ensure that people are accommodated as close to their homes and local communities as possible and will continue to work with the Department of Health on the overall programme which is referenced in the NSP 2021 and in the associated Capital Plan.</p></reply>

The legislation also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p></reply>

The NCDS was expanded to 3rd level campuses in 2019 and will continue to operate in this context as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and students return to in-person tuition.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that those with a GMS (medical) card already have access to most forms of contraception, subject only to the &euro;1.50 prescription charge. Those with a GP visit card are supported to some extent as the clinical consultation cost of contraception is reduced. The Drugs Payment Scheme, for which anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is eligible, covers the cost of prescription items above a limit of &euro;114 per month. </p>  <p>  However, I am very conscious that, for those who do not qualify for a GMS (medical) card, cost can be a barrier to accessing their preferred or most appropriate form of contraception.  As such, Minister Donnelly, myself and our Department remain committed to providing free contraception over a phased period, starting with women aged 17-25, as set out in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Funding allocations for the health sector in 2022 will be announced on Budget Day as per usual practice.</p></reply>

Menopause has been identified as a priority under the Women's Health Taskforce. The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce was established in September 2019 with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. The Taskforce has met fourteen times since it was established in September 2019. A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce in 2020, with the issue of menopause recognised and included as one of these priority areas.</p>  <p>  The issue of menopause has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. A report on the findings of this &lsquo;radical listening&rsquo; exercise was published on September 14th 2021.</p>  <p>  In relation to support for women at work through the menopause, women&rsquo;s health will be represented at the Healthy Workplace implementation group which is to be established in 2021, following the publication of the Healthy Workplace Framework in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. Through this representation, the particular issues for women at work will be highlighted for consideration. This has particular reference to menopause within the workplace.</p>  <p>  At present, there is existing guidance available from CIPD.ie for organisations who wish to consider their response and support to women throughout their menopause journey within work. They provide resources for people managers and professionals to use in the workplace to help break the stigma of women going through the menopause. This includes a menopause at work document which can help organisations consider how they can make their workplaces more supportive for women throughout their menopause journey.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health and the Women's Health Taskforce are committed to improving the experience of women in Ireland through the menopause. This is underscored by the announcement on September 10th of a new approach to menopause care in Ireland, beginning with the establishment of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic. This forms a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p>  <p>  Menopause will continue to be a priority for the Women's Health Taskforce for 2021 and 2022.</p></reply>

The reviews examined electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products including their public health harms or benefits and their effectiveness as an aid to cessation of smoking tobacco products.</p>  <p>  The evidence reviews found that e-cigarettes are not harmless but that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes, that e-cigarettes are as effective as nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation up to 6 months and that there is a positive association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking in adolescents. </p>  <p>  The reviews also made clear that further research was needed on the effects of alternatives such as heat-not-burn tobacco products as there is currently insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about these products. The Department of Health continues to monitor emerging evidence concerning novel products.</p>  <p>  E-cigarette usage is monitored in the Healthy Ireland Survey. The most recent survey (2019) found that 5% of people reported using electronic cigarettes. Use of e-cigarettes among smokers was 10%, among ex-smokers was 13% and among non-smokers was 1%. </p>  <p>  In relation to tobacco smoking, the 2019 Healthy Ireland survey found that the overall smoking prevalence in Ireland had dropped to 17%, with 14% smoking regularly and 3% occasionally.  It is not possible to point to any single factor or product as the cause of changes in smoking rates which is why Ireland's Tobacco Free Ireland policy, and the WHO MPOWER model on which it is based, both recommend multiple measures to address tobacco smoking. Those measures including addressing areas such price, restrictions on promotion and cessation services.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme for a Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill includes multiple measures to reduce the disease, disability and death associated with tobacco smoking. The Scheme for a Bill provides for a licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products, a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines, a prohibition on the sale of e-cigarettes to persons under the age of 18 and a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products and e-cigarettes by persons under the age of 18. The General Scheme is with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and has also been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny.</p></reply>

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows: </p>  <p>  - Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).  </p>  <p>  - Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). </p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team.  </p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12 yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.</p>  <p>  Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf</p>  <p>   The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily</p>  <p>  - Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease</p>  <p>  - Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings</p>  <p>  - Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting</p>  <p>  - Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.</p>  <p>  On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test. This is to balance the observation period required for children for signs of infection, with testing at the most relevant time, whilst not prolonging restricted movements and the harms to children from these restrictions.</p></reply>
