Whilst I am very much aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment I remain committed to restoring the strength of the Defence Forces to 9,500. </p><p>The Government have acknowledged that there are recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces that must be addressed. It is a fact that members of the Permanent Defence Force are being attracted to jobs elsewhere in a buoyant labour market.</p><p>In light of the particular difficulties being faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of recruitment and retention issues in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Report, which has been accepted by Government, contains a broad range of recommendations which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements, these include:</p><p>- a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance, </p><p>- the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances,</p><p>- the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.</p><p>These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.</p><p>The Report also contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving work-force planning, recruitment and conditions of service. </p><p>The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out the timelines and objectives, indicating the commitment to deliver on the Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the PDF and to identify further retention measures within the context of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. Work on implementing the plan is underway and, under my direction, is being prioritised by Civil and Military Management.</p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the PSPC&rsquo;s recommendations, in tandem with pay benefits being delivered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent being a 1.5% increase on 1st September, will ameliorate current recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force. These measures will build upon a range of recruitment and retention actions already in train.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400059#WRA01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17, 20, 26, 30, 34 and 36 together.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the longstanding desire of PDFORRA to associate with ICTU. </p>  <p>  In 2017, in a non-binding ruling, the European Committee of Social Rights concluded that prohibiting military personnel from the right to strike was not in breach of the European Social Charter, but that the Charter was breached by prohibiting the representative associations from affiliating with a national employee organisation, such as ICTU, and in respect of the right to bargain collectively.</p>  <p>   This case related to a complaint made by EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, on behalf of PDFORRA, concerning the lack of certain rights for military representative associations in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The complainant claimed that Ireland was in breach of the European Social Charter by prohibiting military personnel from the right to strike, prohibiting the Permanent Defence Force representative associations from affiliating with a national employee organisation such as ICTU and an alleged restriction on the Permanent Defence Force representative associations at negotiations on national pay agreements.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the conclusion of the European Committee of Social Rights that the prohibition on the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces is not a violation of the European Social Charter. It is critically important that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for complaint pre-dated a number of significant Government initiatives. In relation to collective bargaining, the Government established an independent Public Service Pay Commission in 2016, to provide objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations were invited to the negotiations on the agreement which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. They were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations. </p>  <p>  Both PDFORRA and RACO accepted the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus on the lower paid. The increases in pay are being implemented on a phased basis with the most recent increase being a 1.75% increases on annualised salaries with effect from 1 September 2019.</p>  <p>  Section 2(3) of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, prohibits the Defence Forces representative associations from being associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body, without the consent of the Minister. </p>  <p>  To compensate for these limitations there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including  redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces Ombudsman and a Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, that is PDFORRA and RACO, to engage with the Official side.</p>  <p>  Having regard to commitments made under pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force can make representations in relation to their pay and conditions of service through their representative bodies. </p>  <p>  In light of the many changes in the industrial relations landscape since the establishment of the scheme, I initiated a fundamental review of the scheme in 2018.</p>  <p>  While the majority of the recommendations arising from the review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the C&amp;A scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, there are no recommendations relating to the amendment of Industrial Relations legislation. </p>  <p>  Instead, the Reviewer recommended that the Departmental and Representative sides agree a revised scheme implementing the recommendations in the Review. The reviewer recommended that the revised scheme be reviewed after a three-year period as this would afford the parties an opportunity to assess the schemes performance. The parties to the scheme are in the process of developing and agreeing a revised scheme. It is not intended to make any legislative amendment that will pre-empt the outcome of the revised scheme.   </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the review included consideration of the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights in the case of the European Organisation of Military Associations (Euromil) v Ireland. One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the ICTU to explore the practicalities of a PDF representative association forming association/affiliation with the ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.</p>  <p>  This is in the context of a statement which the European Committee of Social Rights took into consideration in their deliberations where EUROMIL claimed that ICTU had stated that PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary and that this remains the position of ICTU. </p>  <p>  I asked my officials to examine this matter further and in this regard Defence management (civil and military) have engaged in discussions with ICTU.</p>  <p>  Association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. The feasibility of association is the subject of ongoing discussion and engagement with ICTU. </p>  <p>  I have recently met both RACO and PDFORRA and this matter was discussed in the course of the meetings.  </p>  <p>  The implications of any possible decision around association or affiliation are being carefully considered.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400059#WRA02000"><p>As at 31st August 2019, 558 personnel had discharged from the Permanent Defence Force.  The term 'discharges' encompasses personnel who left for a variety of reasons including on age grounds, at end of contract and voluntary discharges and also includes a number of trainees who exited prior to completion of their initial training. There will be additional discharges in 2019 for various reasons and the majority of personnel who discharge do so prior to the mandatory retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  </p>  <p>  In 2018 the overarching turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force was 8.1%.  While the overall average departure rate since 2002 is 6.3% this peaked in 2012 at 8.58%.  This departure rate, or turnover rate, is comparable to, and in some cases more favourable than, other military organisations worldwide. However, the overarching turnover level does not illustrate important underlying trends. As the rate of turnover within a military organisation can differ across functional areas, the impact of turnover can vary accordingly.  Headline turnover figures do not reflect this complexity.  </p>  <p>  The issue of a fluctuating high turnover rate is also a feature of other military organisations. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this does not detract from the Governments goal of restoring the Permanent Defence Force to a strength of 9,500 personnel and, in that regard, I have previously acknowledged that there are recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces which is reflective of the current buoyant economic environment and jobs market. </p>  <p>  I brought these issues to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission and the recommendations contained in their recent report have been accepted by Government.  These recommendations are being progressed through a detailed implementation plan that is driving a number of projects to implement specific recommendations.</p>  <p>  The recommendations relating to increases in certain allowances and the re-introduction of a service commitment scheme for Air Corp pilots in the Air Corps are currently being considered by the Defence Forces Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  As I have said already today, while it is clear that there is and has been a significant amount of work undertaken in this area, I continue to work closely with the Secretary General of my Department and the Defence Forces Chief of Staff to further enhance the responses to the issues facing the Defence Forces at this time. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400059#WRA02500"><p>The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me and my Department. Mental health supports are part of a range of medical and non-medical services provided to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them. </p>  <p>  Medical mental health services available to personnel include access to clinical psychology and psychiatry services. The Psychology service assesses, diagnoses, treats and advises on strategies to prevent mental health disorders and there are currently two Clinical Psychologists employed by the Defence Forces. Psychiatry services specialise in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. </p>  <p>  Deputies will already be aware of the ongoing efforts made by my Department to fill the vacancy left by the previous in-house military psychiatrist, who retired in May 2018. In this regard, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist, which closed on 30th September 2018, yielded no applications. </p>  <p>  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, attempts were made to secure a locum psychiatrist but these also proved unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  In order to explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I gave approval for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist on a temporary 24-month contract at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) sanctioned the competition.  </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service is currently conducting a competition to fill the position.  The closing date for the competition is 26 September 2019 and I am informed that there has been interest expressed in the vacancy.    </p>  <p>  Until this vacancy is filled, interim services are being provided through a combination of external public and private services.  I wish to stress again that there is no delay in referring Defence Forces personnel requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments. Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate.  </p>  <p>  As I have outlined in the past, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service. The difficulty with recruitment for such a position is not unique to the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>   In addition to the clinical supports I have outlined, non-medical mental health services are provided by the Defence Forces Personnel Support Service.  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service provides a welfare, information, psycho-social support and referral service to serving members of the Defence Forces and their families. </p>  <p>  The service is also available to civilian employees, and in a limited role to veterans. This service sustains and enhances the individual well-being of personnel, and promotes a safe and positive work culture, in order to support the effectiveness of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The service is delivered through a network of military Barrack Personnel Support Service Officers and civilian Occupational Social Workers.  This network of professionals is prepared to provide immediate help to service personnel and their families in a routine environment or at a time of crisis.  This assistance can range from the simple provision of information to counselling or, if required, signposting and referral to specialist help and assistance. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the assistance may include providing psychosocial support, counselling and information &amp;amp; assistance services on a variety of issues, including relationships, general finances, addiction, retirement (including pensions and gratuities), housing, taxation and PRSI and much more.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department funds a confidential counselling, referral and support service for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence volunteers.

In this regard, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist, which closed on 30th September 2018, yielded no applications. </p>  <p>  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, attempts were made to secure a locum psychiatrist but these also proved unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  In order to explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I gave approval for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist on a temporary 24-month contract at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) sanctioned the competition.  </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service is currently conducting a competition to fill the position.  The closing date for the competition is 26 September 2019 and I am informed that there has been interest expressed in the vacancy.    </p>  <p>  Until this vacancy is filled, interim services are being provided through a combination of external public and private services.  I wish to stress again that there is no delay in referring Defence Forces personnel requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments. Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate.  </p>  <p>  As I have outlined in the past, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service. The difficulty with recruitment for such a position is not unique to the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

On 9th July last, the Government published the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update. This reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis, including the Brexit Omnibus Act 2019, to prepare for a no deal Brexit.  It sets out the next steps to be taken between now and 31st October. </p>  <p>  While the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements, it remains the Government&rsquo;s view that the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border is for the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, to be ratified.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the avoidance of a hard border and Ireland and the EU are at one on this.  The Government is working closely with the European Commission to meet the shared twin objectives of protecting the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it, and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding physical infrastructure at the border. This work is looking at necessary checks to preserve Ireland&rsquo;s full participation in the Single Market and Customs Union.  </p>  <p>  In these circumstances, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region. In terms of deployment of military personnel to the border, as I have said in the past, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

My main focus is returning the Naval Service to its full capacity. As you know, two ships L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Orla were brought in for routine maintenance earlier this year and are now on Operational Pause. A number of their crew have been redeployed within the fleet. </p>  <p>  A high level civil military team has been working on addressing the issues facing the Naval Service and has identified a number of specific HR options for consideration. I receive regular feedback on the work of the group. I met with them last week for a detailed brief. It goes without saying that as we deal with these issues, the safety of serving personnel must be the number one priority.</p>  <p>  In light of the particular difficulties faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report, which has been accepted by Government, contains a broad range of recommendations which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements, these include:</p>  <p>  - a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance </p>  <p>  - the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances,</p>  <p>  - the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance of by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. </p>  <p>  The Report also contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving work-force planning, recruitment and conditions of service. </p>  <p>  The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out the timelines and objectives, indicating the commitment to deliver on the Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the PDF and to identify further retention measures within the context of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. Work on implementing the plan is underway and, under my direction, is being prioritised by Civil and Military Management.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the PSPC&rsquo;s recommendations, in tandem with pay benefits being delivered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent being a 1.5% increase on 1st September, are all intended to ameliorate current recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force, including the Naval Service. </p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  </p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

The full spectrum of personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise.  Between 2016 and 2018 over 2,000 personnel were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force while, in February 2019, the largest ever cadet class in the history of the State was commissioned.  Nevertheless, I recognise that reaching a strength level of 9,500 personnel is a key challenge for the Defence Forces at present but I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the means to continue to carry out all of the roles assigned by Government.  </p>  <p>  At National level, representation of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as a natural disaster rests with three designated principal response agencies, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant Local Authority  and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles.  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In terms of overseas, at present there are close to 680 members of the Defence Forces serving in missions worldwide. In planning and supporting overseas operations, the combined engagement of the Defence Forces and Departmental staff is an essential element in the effective management of deployments.  This includes reviewing potential operations, rotation planning, procurement planning and training.  My Department and the Defence Forces work together to ensure the maximisation of options available to Government to meets its international obligations and I am satisfied this will continue in furtherance of Ireland's foreign and defence policy objectives.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018, 20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces,  and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently underway in this regard. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with the fourth, the L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in late 2018.  In addition, planning is ongoing for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them, including vehicles and communication systems, which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, both at home and overseas.   </p>  <p>  Work is well advanced in relation to updating the Air Corps' fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) as provided for in the White Paper. Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet. The contract is well underway and it is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. </p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is underway in my Department at present and it is expected to be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  The existing fleet of eight (8) Pilatus PC9 training aircraft is not due for replacement until 2025. The current fleet of two (2) EC 135 and six (6) AW 139 helicopters will continue to deliver the required Defence Forces support and other support capabilities over the lifetime of the White Paper.  The Air Corps also operates one (1) Lear LR45 aircraft which is used primarily in the provision of the Ministerial Air Transport Service.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the training and operational aircraft outlined above, the Air Corps operates one (1) Britten Norman Defender fixed wing aircraft and two (2) EC135 helicopters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure their operational capability, all Air Corps aircraft must undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry.</p></reply>

The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Significant work is well advanced in relation to updating the Air Corps' fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing Cessna fleet with three larger, more capable, fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that delivery of these new aircraft will commence in 2020. Planning is also well advanced to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently close to finalisation in this regard.</p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Four new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2018.  In addition, planning is now underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a new Multi Role Vessel.</p>  <p>  In terms of personnel, between 2016 and 2018 over 2,000 personnel were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) while, in February 2019, the largest ever cadet class in the history of the State was commissioned.  Nevertheless, I recognise that reaching a full strength of 1,094 Naval Service personnel and a full strength of 886 Air Corps personnel is a key challenge for the Defence Forces at present but I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the means to continue to carry out the roles assigned by Government.  In this regard, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being taken including the fact that the competition for General Service Recruits now remains open throughout the year to maximise the Defence Forces' training capacity and to give applicants more opportunities to apply.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, the UK decision to exit from the EU does not of itself give rise to greater responsibilities for the Defence Forces. However, prudent planning in relation to all situations that may require a Defence Forces response, including by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, is undertaken by the Defence Forces in the normal course.  Furthermore, my Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

The Group was established on foot of a Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2014, led by a number of developing countries, including Ecuador and South Africa. Four sessions of the Group have taken place to date.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which its work has been conducted, Ireland is among those countries which favours participation in the annual sessions of the Inter-Governmental Working Group.  We also believe that all stakeholders, including civil society, trade unions and business, should be enabled to participate and are concerned by reports that they may be excluded from the next session which will take place in October in Geneva.  Ecuador has circulated a revised draft treaty in advance of this meeting which contains some positive developments compared to an earlier version presented in 2018.  At this stage it is foreseen that the EU will attend the forthcoming session and, while welcoming the improvements in the draft, will signal that it is not in a position to enter into detailed negotiations pending completion of a comprehensive analysis.  It is likely however that the EU will avail of the opportunity to pose a number of questions on issues of concern.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty.  With regard to its scope, we believe that all economic operators, whether transnational or purely domestic, should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. We would also wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point, I would note that of the 22 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.</p></reply>

A significant number of Rohingya civilians were also internally displaced within Rakhine and 128,000 people remain in IDP camps having fled previous bouts of violence. Recent months have again seen an escalation of violence in Rakhine State and neighbouring Chin State due to ongoing conflict between the Myanmar Security Forces and ethnic armed groups. The situation remains unstable with increasing violence generating further displacement of civilians.      </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, has consistently called for the accountability of those who are responsible for such crimes and we continue to advocate for, and support, actions at international level to address this crisis.</p>  <p>  The EU has been at the forefront of the international response to the Rohingya crisis. Targeted restrictive measures have been put in place by the EU against senior military officers of the Myanmar Security Forces responsible for these acts and further measures are being kept under review. The EU Foreign Affairs Council has adopted a series of Council Conclusions addressing gross human rights violations in Myanmar&rsquo;s Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. These conclusions press for Myanmar to hold those responsible for these crimes to account and to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced to their places of origin. </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission is currently reviewing Myanmar&rsquo;s trade preferences under the framework of the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme. </p>  <p>  The EU has also worked with our international partners to press for action at UN level including acting as pen-holder on several key initiatives including the establishment of both the UNHRC mandated Independent International Fact-Finding Mission and the recently operational Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. These are important steps in ensuring accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in January of this year, I attended the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting in Brussels, during which the crisis in Rakhine State was raised directly with Myanmar and with our ASEAN counterparts. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work with our EU colleagues, and wider partners to respond to the situation and to press for long term solutions to the crisis. Ultimately, the best long-term framework for a sustainable solution that addresses the concerns of the Rohingya, including the key issue of securing citizenship rights, remains the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. </p></reply>

Over four years of conflict have resulted in the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis, with the country&rsquo;s economy decimated and millions on the brink of famine. </p><p>The EU has been clear from the beginning that the crisis in Yemen can only be solved by political means. Ireland and the EU fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about a political resolution, including his efforts to ensure implementation of the 2018 Stockholm Agreement between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities. EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Yemen twice this year, and our support for the UN process has been unequivocal. UNSE Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support in getting the parties to the table and sustaining the political pressure, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without the EU. </p><p>Despite the positive sign which the Stockholm conference last December represented,<b></b>recent months have seen continued violence. The opening of a new front in August in the southern port city of Aden is a worrying development in what was already a multifaceted and extremely complex conflict. Coalition airstrikes in Dhamar province on 1 September killed dozens of people, and Ireland fully supports the EU statement in response to that attack. Ireland's position on attacks against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law has been very clearly conveyed to Saudi Arabia. </p><p>The EU is the largest donor to the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM). UNVIM was established in May 2016 to facilitate more efficient verification that imports of commercial goods at Yemen's ports do not contain arms . Following the Stockholm Agreement, UNVIM has also been assigned the role of supporting the Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in the management and inspection of ports. The UNVIM operation is making an important contribution to ensuring the continued flow of commercial goods to Yemen. </p><p>This conflict has had devastating humanitarian effects, with almost 80% of the population of Yemen in need of humanitarian assistance. The EU is a very significant donor to Yemen, and has contributed over &euro;700 million in development and humanitarian assistance to the country since the crisis began in 2015, including &euro;440 million in humanitarian aid alone. In addition to contributing our national share to these EU funds, on a bilateral basis Ireland has provided &euro;21.5 million in humanitarian assistance in Yemen since 2012.  </p><p>Ireland, the UN, the EU and the wider international community will continue to play an important role in attempting to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and facilitate a political solution for the people of Yemen. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.164.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400061#WRC04000"><p>I can confirm that my attention has been drawn to the document referred to by the Deputy as set out in my replies to previous PQs on the matter (35731/19 and 36296/19). </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the document was an internal document prepared in 2007 and that it was never published on the Revenue website. The document has no legal value or authority over VAT legislation in place on 1 January 1991 or subsequently and has no legal effect. It does not mean that food supplement products were legally zero rated on 1 January 1991 or subsequently.</p><p>Irish VAT law does not provide a zero rate for food supplement products and under EU VAT law Ireland is precluded from introducing such a provision. A zero VAT rate for food and drink is provided for under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991. The legislative provision for food and drink was in place on 1 January 1991; however, there was no legislative provision for food supplement products and therefore they cannot be legally zero rated.</p><p>Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils and references included on the VAT rates database and other information on the Revenue website simply reflected this practice. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplement products was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue.</p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its zero rating concession had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand the zero rate to products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.</p><p>Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. </p><p>Following this review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Act 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the consideration of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p><p>Over the last few months, my Department carried out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper as part of the Budget 2020 process, available here: </p><p>The options outlined in the TSG paper will be considered in the normal way as part of the budgetary process. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.179.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400061#WRC05500"><p>The Irish insurance sector is diverse, comprising life, non-life and reinsurance firms operating across a range of product and geographical markets.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation of the sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  These are to: </p>  <p>  - establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland);</p>  <p>  - establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FOE); or</p>  <p>  - operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FOS), i.e. conduct business in Ireland from another country.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are companies operating in each of these channels in the Irish insurance market.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of access to markets within the EU, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation.  Therefore it plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU.</p>  <p>  However, there are other factors, beyond the legal and regulatory framework which also inform the decision making processes of insurance companies as to whether or not to operate or to continue to operate in any country.  For example, the number of claims, the level of awards for personal injuries granted, the legal costs associated with settling/defending claims, and the time taken to settle claims will be important such considerations for insurers. In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as the leisure, adventure and hospitality sectors where, because of these aforementioned factors, insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  Indeed, I understand that in recent meetings in London between Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, and a number of UK insurers/underwriters who have recently left the Irish insurance market, the reasons above were outlined as factors in  their decision to leave the Irish market.  Therefore for these parts of the Irish market there is undoubtedly an issue around its attractiveness and this consequently has impacted on competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report. That Report concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. The recently enacted Judicial Council Act 2019 provides for the establishment of this Council, which will allow for the recalibration, by the Judiciary, of award levels for personal injuries.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to establish the Judicial Council and the subsequent Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, it is my hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and will prioritise it accordingly by completing a first set of guidelines, which take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, as soon as possible.  At the same time, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has begun a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, taking account of Constitutional considerations as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.</p>  <p>  I believe that the creation and implementation of the Personal Injuries guidelines by the Judiciary will result in the lowering of award levels.  As importantly, I believe it should lead to a greater consistency in award levels for injuries of the same type.  This therefore should mean that there will be less of an incentive for a person to litigate, as they should not be getting any more from a court award than a PIAB award, which in turn should have a significant impact on legal costs.  In summary, I believe that over time the clearest signal that these changes are working is when there is an increase in the number of PIAB cases being accepted by claimants particularly for minor and moderate injuries.  In addition, I believe that the cumulative effects of the completion of the CIWG recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and a more competitive insurance market overall. Furthermore, Government expects that the market will adjust positively to these developments and thus competition and competitiveness throughout the market place should materially improve. </p></reply>

While there has been a considerable improvement in the overall economy and mortgage market since then, for example overall arrears have fallen and new lending has increased, it is accepted that the financial crash continues to impact on the mortgage market and that problems still remain. Some of the legacy issues which remain are the current higher level of concentration in the Irish mortgage market compared to that which prevailed before the crash and higher capital requirements of banks for mortgages due in significant part to the high levels of losses incurred by banks on mortgages provided in the years leading up to the financial crash.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that there have been some improvements and increasing competition in the market for the provision of new mortgage credit.  Some non-bank lenders have recently entered the market or expanded their product range to include primary dwelling mortgages.  The Deputy will also be aware that over the recent past some of the main mortgage providers have reduced interest rates on different mortgage products or introduced new products, particularly in relation to fixed interest rate products, thus demonstrating that they are competing in the market.  Also, enhancements have been made to the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code in order to better facilitate the mortgage switching process between lenders and also to require lenders to provide information to their borrowers on their other mortgage products that could provide savings to their customers.</p></reply>

Modified domestic demand, an underlying measure of growth in the economy, grew by 4.5 per cent for 2018 as a whole.</p><p>One of the best barometers of the health in the economy is the labour market. The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 45,000 (+2.0 per cent) in the year to Q2 2019. As a result, there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland.</p><p>The cornerstone of our recovery, has been the improvement in our competitiveness. Since July 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. The improvement in our competitiveness reflects the hard-won productivity gains made over the last number of years, alongside wage and price moderation. </p><p>Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first eight months of 2019, average annual inflation of just 0.9 per cent was recorded. </p><p>On wage developments, while average annual earnings grew by over 3 per cent in 2018, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in labour income is a welcome development. However it needs to be monitored closely, as a significant acceleration in wages could undermine Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness to other European countries.</p><p>Over the medium-term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain conscious of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness.</p><p>Despite the positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for housing and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.</p></reply>

The <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook</i>, due to be published with the Budget 2020 documentation, will update this assessment. At present the balance of risk is firmly tilted to the downside, both in the short-term and over the medium-term.</p><p>The Irish economy is in an unusual position, facing possible domestic overheating and capacity constraints on the one hand, and a slowdown in key export markets on the other. In addition to this, the nature and timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU is causing uncertainty in terms of the EU, including Ireland&rsquo;s, future trading relationship. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s consistent message has been that a no deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels. These include macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges, both immediately and in the longer term. </p><p>In March 2019, the Department of Finance and the ESRI published a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of Brexit. This report shows that compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a &lsquo;deal&rsquo; scenario, and 5.0 per cent in a disorderly &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario, ten years after Brexit compared to a no Brexit baseline. </p><p>The most recent Contingency Action Plan, published in July, set out in detail the Government&rsquo;s analysis of the risks and impacts of a no deal outcome across 26 key areas. A no deal outcome will never be the EU choice but it remains a significant threat. Preparedness and contingency planning must continue at EU and Member State level. </p><p>Given the lack of clarity regarding the timing and format that the UK&rsquo;s exit will take, I recently announced that Budget 2020 will be framed on the assumption of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. Three main factors influenced the Government&rsquo;s approach:</p><blockquote>-First, to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario;<br /><br />-Second, to safeguard the hard won progress of recent years in stabilising the public finances; and <br /><br />-Finally, to avoid a situation in which decisions made in the Budget might need to be reversed in future. </blockquote><p>Assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, while preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances.</p><p>In a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario, the Government will make the resources available to support those in need, and to introduce timely, targeted and temporary supports to the sectors of the economy most exposed to the impact of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>Other than &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo;, the main short-term risks relate to a deteriorating international environment and an escalation of trade protectionism. </p><p>Over the medium-term, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment, and changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime. </p><p>The economy is in a good position to meet these challenges. Economic growth, which resumed early this decade, has been consistently among the highest in the EU for a number of years, notwithstanding reservations about the headline data. The recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2 per cent from the peak of 16 per cent in 2012. </p><p>The headline budget deficit was eliminated last year for the first time in a decade. The Government has been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our fiscal buffers by balancing our books, reducing our debt burden and establishing the Rainy Day Fund.</p><p>Our companies are being supported to prepare for Brexit, to diversify their markets and supply chains, to develop new skills and to explore new opportunities. </p><p>The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges ahead, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the 10-year National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland 2019.</p></reply>

The paper outlining this approach &ldquo;Funding the cost of regulation&rdquo; is available at the following link.  In order to achieve the move to full industry funding, I recently approved the Central Bank to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from firms on a phased basis to 100% by 2024.  </p><p>In relation to the credit union sector, I approved an exception which will see the cost of the levy to that sector being increased on a phased basis to 50% to be reached by 2021, at which time a review of the impact on the sector and a public consultation regarding increasing the levy beyond 50% will take place. Since 2004 the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p><p>There is no estimate at present for the cost of regulation of the financial industry by the Central Bank for 2019, however, the 2018 cost was &euro;213 million.  Based on existing funding from industry for 2018, moving to 100% funding for that year, by reducing the subvention, would have meant estimated savings of &euro;68 million for 2018.  In 2018, Credit Unions paid &euro;1.6 million towards the cost of their regulation under the Industry Funding Levy.  Therefore, Credit Unions currently contribute approximately 8% to the cost of their regulation.  </p><p>Full details of the Funding of Financial Regulation activities is available in the Central Bank of Ireland Annual Report 2018 available at: The aforementioned paper &quot;Funding the cost of regulation&quot; is available here: </p></reply>

This central register is operated under the aegis of the Companies Registration Office and began accepting filings on 29 July 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Regulations is to prevent the use of corporate entities as vehicles for money laundering or terrorist financing and to provide competent authorities with access to information on the true ownership and control of corporate entities. Therefore, the obligation to file information with the central register applies to all companies formed under the Companies Act and societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, with the exception of companies listed on regulated markets that are subject to disclosure requirements consistent with European Union law or subject to equivalent international standards which ensure adequate transparency of ownership information.  The Regulations apply to community and social enterprises if they are created under the above Acts.

The scope of the Regulations is necessary in order to meet the State's obligations on foot of the Directive.</p>  <p>  While the relevant legislation was signed by myself as Minister for Finance, the register is maintained by a &ldquo;Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies&rdquo;, as provided for under Regulation 18 of SI 110/2019, who has been appointed by the Minister for  Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

As shown in Figure 5 of the publication, the amount of losses forward used for all companies in the financial and insurance sector is &euro;3.2 billion for 2017 with an estimated tax cost of &euro;400 million.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that in 2018 my officials produced a report for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the potential consequences of changes to the corporation tax loss relief, including in particular relief for losses carried forward for banks. This report, which contains further information on the rationale for loss relief and the technical considerations relevant to the operation of the relief, is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

As part of the annual Taxation Strategy Group (TSG) process undertaken by officials from my Department earlier this year, a proposal for an income tax incentive measure to encourage domestic retrofits was examined and published within the Climate Action and Tax paper. This examination was prompted by the publication of the All of Government Climate Action Plan in June 2019, where it was noted that the built environment accounted for 12.7% of Ireland&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gases in 2017. </p><p>The paper sought to identify the potential cost of a domestic retrofit tax incentive and to explore the factors that might need to be taken into account in the event that such an incentive was to be considered.  The design model used for this purpose was the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) which expired on 31 December 2018 in accordance with its sunset clause. </p><p>Briefly, it was suggested in the TSG paper that the proposed incentive might operate as follows:</p><p>- The measure would be targeted at domestic properties with a BER rating of B3 or less; </p><p>- Participants in the scheme would be able to claim an income tax credit for expenditure on certain qualifying works; </p><p>- The credit would amount to a specified percentage (13.5%) of the total qualifying expenditure (excluding VAT) on the qualifying works, and would be claimed over a 2 year period subsequent to the year in which the works were paid for; </p><p>- These works would have to be carried out on a qualifying property by a qualifying contractor.</p><p>Qualifying works would include wall insulation, attic insulation, floor insulation, window/door upgrades, ventilation systems; renewable energy (heat pumps, solar panels), etc. </p><p>It was assumed that if an individual receives a grant for qualifying work, then the total &lsquo;qualifying expenditure&rsquo; under the incentive would be reduced by an amount equal to the grant amount. </p><p>Among other things, the paper also examined the potential cost of meeting the target set out in the All of Government Climate Action Plan of completing 50,000 building retrofits per annum to achieve a B2 BER up to the year 2030. Using certain assumptions, it was estimated that the annual tax cost could be of the order of &euro;40 million per annum. </p><p>The paper was published on my Department's website and is available at the following link:</p><p> . </p></reply>

The day to day operations of the banks are the sole responsibility of the boards and management teams and each bank must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p><p>In regards to your question about repayments, both AIB and PTSB have a wide range of mortgage products with differing rates.

First of all I think it is important to note that neither AIB nor PTSB fund their mortgage books via the ECB. However it is true that Irish mortgage rates are higher than the European average. Indeed the reasons for this were explored in a report published by my department in March (Risk Weighted Assets in Ireland: The Link to Mortgage Interest Rates). </p><p>This report shows that a large part of the difference between Irish mortgage rates and European mortgage rates is linked to how capital rules are applied. The very significant loss history from the last crisis mean that Irish banks now have to hold far more capital on mortgage loans than their European peers. This and other contributing factors are discussed in the report. The report is available at:  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.282.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400063#WRE04100"><p>I am aware of the study referred to by the Deputy which was carried out between mid-June and the start of September 2019. It focused on employer and public liability insurance and was responded to by 770 Public Participation Networks members (which equates to just over 5% of total PPN membership). The survey indicated that 83% of respondents have seen their insurance increase over the last 3 years, 45% indicated that they may have to reduce events or services, and more worryingly, 47% indicated that they may have to close within the next year due to rising insurance costs. </p><p>This study confirms much of what we already know about there being a significant problem in relation to the cost and availability of public and employer liability cover.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to either consumers or businesses.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to reemphasise however that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report </i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report</i>.  Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:</p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales; </p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>in July, which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;</p><p>- The Law Reform Commission (LRC) has undertaken a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses and organisations with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses, community groups and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, and;</p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, a divisional focus on insurance fraud guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  However, I recognise there is still much work to be done in the public/employer liability insurance areas. In this regard, a big issue which the Government is trying to address is the level of awards as well as the inconsistent application of such awards. This problem is a significant part of the reason a number of UK insurers have left the Irish market, a point, which was confirmed to the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD when he met a number of such companies in London recently </p><p>Consequently, I believe that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses and community groups is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council in the near future is very important in this regard.  </p><p>What will also be key is that insurers pass on the benefits of any reduction in award levels to policyholders. In this regard, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has been engaging with them in order to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and, even more importantly, widen their risk appetite to reflect savings made, in particular if there is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  I am also encouraged by the comments made by a number of insurers at the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach Oireachtas Committee in July about the passing on of savings arising from a recalibration of award levels downwards.  </p><p>In conclusion, I am believe that the cumulative effects of the completion of the recommendations of the CIWG, including a reduction in award levels, will lead to reductions in pricing in particular for small businesses and community groups and also to a more competitive and stable insurance market.</p></reply>

Earlier this year, the Oireachtas passed extensive legislation covering contingency arrangements in relation to the exit of the UK from the EU under these circumstances. The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 was published on 22 February.  It completed all Oireachtas stages on 13 March and was signed into law by the President on 17 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  The legislation introduced a specific measure relating to Duty Free sales between Ireland and the UK in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The provision, contained in the Act, was designed as a contingency measure as it was anticipated that a solution to such matters would form part of a future relationship agreement between the EU and UK. </p>  <p>  In the Act, I made provision to impose restrictions on duty-free sales in Ireland to UK bound travellers, which I planned to implement if the UK introduced similar restrictions in respect of Ireland bound travellers in the UK. As the UK has now decided, in the event of a no deal Brexit, to apply an unrestricted duty-free scheme, in line with this reciprocal policy Ireland will not now commence the relevant legislative measure. Therefore, European Union Duty Free rules, in relation to passenger travel between the EU and third countries, would apply from 31 October.</p>  <p>  This policy is in compliance with EU law and Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.298.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400064#WRF01600"><p>I would advise the Deputy that while pensions for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (the employer in this case) are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, as the matter raised relates to pension policy for the public service generally, I will address the questions raised.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, I should clarify that retirement lump sum payments under public service pension schemes were not directly reduced by the Financial Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. The FEMPI legislation implemented measures that directly reduced the pay of serving staff and introduced a Public Service Pension Reduction for pensions in payment, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre-existing public service pension schemes (i.e. excluding the Single Public Service Pension Scheme) are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. </p>  <p>  However, because of what is known as the first &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). The second &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or lump sum. </p>  <p>  Rather than enter into the details of the individual case, which, as I say, is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, I would note that where retirement occurred after 1 March 2012, the retirement lump sum would be calculated by reference to the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010 (i.e. following the first FEMPI pay reduction). If the salary was subject to the second FEMPI reduction on 1 July 2013, the operation of the second grace period would mean that the lump sum would still have been calculated by reference to the 1 January 2010 rate.</p>  <p>  In accordance with normal public service pension arrangements, retirement lump sums are calculated on the rates of salary that a public servant is in receipt of at time of retirement (with the exception of the 'grace period' protection I have described above). I have no proposals to make any change in this regard.</p>  <p>  Secondly, in relation to pension increases, the current policy applying to pensions paid under pre-existing pension schemes was agreed by the Government as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). This policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010. Under that policy, pay increases applied to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those annual pensions where the salary on which the annual pension is based, in any case, does not exceed the salary of a serving staff member with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the annual pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p>  <p>  Guidance on operation of the pension increase policy is set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 02/2018, while further instructions have recently been issued in Circular 19/2019.</p>  <p>  Finally, if the pension in question remains subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), the individual will qualify for a further lessening of its impact, or, indeed, its total removal in 2019 or 2020. The Deputy should also note that, no later than 31 December 2020, I will make an order which will specify a date for the full removal of PSPR from the residual group of PSPR-affected pensions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-24a.304.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400064#WRF02200"><p>It should be noted from the outset that in practice fees for making FOI requests were largely abolished under the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  In general, no fee whatsoever is charged for applications under the 2014 Act by an individual for their personal information.  This applies at all stages the FOI process, including with respect to a review by the Information Commissioner.  Based on 2018 figures, this category amounts to almost 60% of all requests.</p>  <p>  With respect to non-personal requests, application fees at the initial stage of the process were abolished under the 2014 Act.  Fees of &euro;30 and &euro;50 respectively apply to internal reviews and reviews by the Information Commissioner, although these can be reduced to &euro;10 and &euro;15 respectively, or waived, where a requester holds a medical card.  Based on 2018 figures, over 97% of non-personal requests were satisfactorily handled without the need for review, and as such no application fee was charged. </p>  <p>  Available statistics do not dis-aggregate internal reviews of requests for personal information, to which no fee applies, and internal reviews of non-personal requests, nor are instances highlighted where reduced fees or a fee waiver applied, therefore it is not possible to state a precise sum recouped in application fees.  Given that, in 2018, 40% of requests were for non-personal information, 1,082 internal reviews overall were carried out by public bodies, and the Commissioner carried out 328 reviews to which an application fee potentially applied, the total figure for all application fees paid in that year may be estimated at well below &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for search and retrieval fees to be charged where a non-personal FOI request requires a minimum of five hours of work merely locating and gathering records.  Therefore, a fee of this nature is only charged where a non-personal request is relatively large, and does not take account of the totality of the work involved in responding, but only the search and retrieval portion.  The fee payable by a requester is capped at a maximum of &euro;500, even where the cost of the work involved may exceed this, and may in appropriate cases be waived entirely on public interest grounds.  Moreover, it should be noted that under the 2014 Act officials are obliged to assist requesters where appropriate in making a more focused request so as to meet their objectives by the most efficient possible means, and that there is nothing to prevent requesters making follow-up requests for additional information.  No figures are available at present to confirm the exact proportion of non-personal requests that attracted a fee, or the total sum recouped by way of search and retrieval charges.</p>  <p>  The final costing of a proposal to remove the remaining FOI fee provisions must also take account of the potential knock-on costs to the exchequer arising out of likely demands on the resources of both public bodies and the Information Commissioner through increased usage of their respective review functions, as well as, in the case of search and retrieval fees, the likely requirement to process a larger amount of more resource-intensive requests.  An analysis of this nature has not been carried out to date, and as such no estimate can be provided in this regard.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, administering the Freedom of Information system in the context of ever-increasing demand presents a significant administrative and resourcing challenge to public bodies.  Since 2013, the last full year of operation for the previous legislation, the number of FOI requests received by public bodies has almost doubled to a total of 36,896 requests in 2018.  The abolition of fees in most cases has been a significant contributory factor to this increase.  In order to support this system, in 2019 the Office of the Information Commissioner was allocated a dedicated program budget of &euro;3,292,000 out of the total allocation of &euro;11,718,000 to the Ombudsman group, within which it shares certain support resources.</p>  <p>  Estimating the true cost of the Freedom of Information system within public bodies has historically proven difficult, as doing so has been taken as necessitating an additional administrative burden on already hard-pressed decision makers to accurately record and collate the time spent on each request at various levels of seniority, as well as other associated costs.  In this regard, the Central Policy Unit for Freedom of Information at my Department has recently initiated a project aiming at measuring the cost to the exchequer of administering FOI in a robust and user friendly manner.  The methodology remains under development, however it is intended that a figure for the true cost of FOI should be available by mid-2020.  Assuming that the number of requests continues on previous trends, it may be anticipated even at this juncture that the total cost will run well into eight figures.</p></reply>

In the 2018/19 school year there were over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid Medical Cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.</p>  <p>  In 2018, receipts from school transport charges amounted to some &euro;15.9m or about 8% of the total cost of the scheme provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Blanchardstown_West_Dublin15 and BlanchardstownVge_Dublin15 school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The application process for patrons to run this school has been completed. </p>  <p>  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Waterville is located in the adjacent Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2014 to serve the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area and had just over 600 pupils enrolled in the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  While the recent announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2019/2020 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0030/2019 which issued on 22 May 2019 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0030_2019.pdf</p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0030/2019 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible.

Individual schools should adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p><p>In relation to textbook costs an agreement was reached with the Irish Educational Publisher&rsquo;s Association which resulted in the agreement of a Code of Practice.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock book rental schemes.</p><p>School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents. Approximately 95% of primary schools and 65% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  </p><p>My Department supports the operation of book rental schemes through the funding provided under its school books grant scheme.  Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;16 million annually to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme.  In addition &euro;15.7 million seed capital was provided over three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools.</p><p>My Department published a circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the costs which include the provision of a book rental scheme.  The circular can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>.</i></p><p>One of the measures in the circular, under the &ldquo;Principles of cost-effective practice&rdquo;, which are to be adopted is that school authorities, &lsquo;phase out the use of workbooks which cannot be reused&rsquo;.  My officials have engaged with the Irish Education Publishers&rsquo; Association (IEPA) to consider how best to ensure the provisions of the circular can best be implemented.  It is acknowledged that the use of workbooks can be beneficial in supporting the development of rudimentary skills, such as, fine motor skills, pre-writing and letter formation skills and phonological awareness skills.</p><p>In relation to revised editions of textbooks, members of the Irish Educational Publishers&rsquo; Association subscribe to a Code of Practice which includes an agreement that publishers will not revise any texts within at least four years - unless there is a change in the curriculum, the state examination or methods of assessment, or if there is a recognised teacher-led demand to do so.</p><p>My Department continues to consider how best to implement the terms of the circular in relation to the use of workbooks.</p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. Consultation between parents, students and schools is now underpinned through the recently published Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information. </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheets on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital technology, including tablets, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment, and affirms that the use of digital technology can enhance the teaching and learning experience. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;60m issued to schools over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years and a further &euro;50m recently issued to schools in respect of the 2018/19 school year.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Blanchardstown_West_Dublin15 and BlanchardstownVge_Dublin15 school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The application process for patrons to run this school has been completed.</p>  <p>  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Waterville is located in the adjacent Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2014 to serve the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area and had just over 600 pupils enrolled in the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  While the recent announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

If all requirements are met, including garda vetting, and fit and proper person requirements, the registration process may be completed in less than the 6-8 week timeframe outlined. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council contacts students in the final year of programmes of initial teacher education in higher education institutions to offer them a fast track registration process upon receipt of their final results.  </p>  <p>  Where a person has obtained their teaching qualifications in another Member State of the EU, Directive 2005/36/EC, as amended, applies. This Directive governs the recognition of professional qualifications across Member States. Where a person has obtained their teaching qualifications and is eligible to practice the profession in another Member State, they may apply to the Teaching Council to seek recognition of their qualifications in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. Assessment of qualifications to determine that they are comparable to accredited qualifications in Ireland may take approximately twelve weeks from the date of receipt of all requested documentation, in accordance with the EU Directive timelines. Applicants must also meet standard registration requirements in relation to character reference, garda vetting and overseas police clearances.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has advised me that where a complete application is submitted and fit and proper person requirements including garda vetting/police clearance are met registration is often completed faster than the standard registration timelines set out above.   </p></reply>

The  process for the payment of an individual teacher is that where a contract is awarded by the managerial authority of a school, application forms are submitted to my Department to enable payment to be set up.  </p>  <p>  The application form must confirm that a teacher is qualified for the appropriate sector and confirm their registration details with the Teaching Council.  Details of bank accounts, pension status and other requested information must also be submitted.  Once a completed application form is received, the payment will be processed as soon as possible.  Normally, payroll closing dates are 10 days ahead of payment date.  Where an application form is not complete or where there are queries on some aspect of the application, the forms will be returned to the schools which can result in a delay to payment being set up for a teacher.  Where a teacher's registration is not active with the Teaching Council, payment can not be made for the period that a person is unregistered. </p>  <p>  Where a teacher is working on a casual / non-casual basis, school authorities enter details of the employee and the claim for payment into the online claims system and these will transfer to the Department&rsquo;s payroll and be paid according to the payroll schedules.  Schools authorities have details of payroll closing dates.  These payments cannot be processed until they are signed off by the school authorities.  If the deadline for payrolls is missed, payments will not be made until the following payroll date.</p>  <p> During July and August, there are up to 20,000 changes to the payrolls operated by my Department.  This consists of  retirements, resignations, career breaks, job-sharing, new appointments, increases / decreases in teaching hours, temporary contracts, secondments, award of Contract of Indefinite Duration, re-deployments, and pension payment set ups.  All appointments and changes are dealt with in chronological order.  It is my Department&rsquo;s policy to set up as many teachers as possible for the first payroll of the new school year but not all payments can be guaranteed as details may not be received in time to enable payment to be made or applications received may be incomplete, and may have to be returned to the managerial authority for completion.  </p>  <p>  Once a contracted teacher is set up on payroll, their payment will continue until the end of the contract.  Teachers&rsquo; working on a casual / non-casual basis will be paid on the next scheduled payroll after the details have been submitted and signed off by the school.  </p></reply>

This arose as incorrect end dates were included in payroll submissions reported to Revenue under the changes introduced by the modernization of PAYE.  The inclusion of these end-dates in the Departments' submissions automatically ceased the DES employment of those concerned in Revenue records and resulted in their available tax credits being made available to other employments. When the Department next requested updated Revenue Payroll Notifications for those impacted, Revenue had already ceased the employments and transferred tax credits leaving no tax credits or cut offs  available for their continuing employments by the Department</p>  <p>  The payroll software was amended for payrolls after the 17th January 2019 to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue. This resolved the problem and refunds of tax were issued to the people involved. </p>  <p>  Staff of my Department actively engaged with the Revenue Commissioners to address the problem at the time.  They have liaised with during the year and continue to liaise with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that no further issues will arise to prevent correct RPN details being applied. </p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.  </p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.   </p>  <p>  In these circumstances the industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken. </p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.  </p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.   </p>  <p>  In these circumstances the industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

In addition to securing the necessary statutory approvals it also includes the preparation of complex and detailed tender documents. In completing Stage 2(b), Design Teams are now required to upgrade design details to ensure that new school buildings are Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) in compliance with the 2017 amendment to Part L of the current Building Regulations. In many cases this has involved a second planning application to allow for the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roof following receipt of the initial planning permission.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that all major school building projects under the Department&rsquo;s Construction Programme are progressed through the various stages of architectural planning in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Design Team Procedures, Building Control Regulations and Public Works Contract requirements and that as the funding is exchequer funding the process and costs associated with any major project must be fully accounted for.</p>  <p>  Design Teams must therefore be diligent in their preparation of the Stage 2(b) tender documentation in order to satisfy all regulatory bodies and my Department's Design Team Procedures. This results in minimising delays during further stages of the project.</p>  <p>  Over the past year, some school building projects have undergone a longer than normal Stage 2b process. This can be due to a complicated or detailed planning application, appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, complications around decant arrangements or issues relating to the site. </p>  <p>  In addition, since November 2018, a number of competitions to pre-qualify suitable and competent building contractors have been challenged in the High Court leading to the need to completely redraft the procedures and processes involved in pre-qualification. This has impacted over the past few months on projects which were not themselves subject to a direct challenge. However, having implemented the revised procedures, my Department has moved proactively to reduce the risk of Stage 2b projects at present and in the future being further delayed by legal challenge.</p>  <p>  My Department also regularly reviews and updates it's suite of guidance and design advice documents which are available to schools and design teams through the Departments web-site. The most recent updates to these documents was in May when revised Guidance on Procurement of Contractors was published and in April when the guidance on Procuring Construction Contractors was revised.</p></reply>

In the 2018/19 school year there were over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  Minister McHugh has recently sanctioned an additional &euro;1m on the school transport budget to allow for temporary alleviation measures to address a shortage of school transport capacity on the post primary scheme in 2019. The cost of these measures is being given to those areas where there is a significant concentration of post-primary children who have paid on time for the 2019/2020 school year and who are attending their second closest school.  A number of measures have been confirmed to alleviate some of the capacity issues in the areas of highest demand in some parts of the country. </p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of transport for the current school year, Bus &Eacute;ireann continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to process applications and design routes to ensure that all eligible pupils who paid on time are facilitated with school transport. In doing this they are endeavouring to facilitate as many concessionary pupils as possible where capacity exists. </p>  <p>  Parents are advised to contact their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office should they have specific queries in regard to capacity on various routes. </p></reply>

The current position is that, in principle, all income received by an applicant for legal aid is liable to be treated as income.  Any exceptions are specifically detailed in the Regulations. The Legal Aid Board has advised me that it gave careful consideration to the matter of HAP and concluded that it had to treat HAP as a form of income.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Legal Aid Board that some applicants are in receipt of significant HAP payments due to high rent levels, particularly in Dublin.  This may affect applicants' financial eligibility for civil legal aid. </p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board has made a submission to my Department regarding financial eligibility for civil legal aid and advice generally.  This includes a proposal on the treatment of HAP for financial eligibility purposes. This proposal is being examined by my Department.

Our Policy Document on Family Reunification, contains a stated business target that visa applications to join Irish citizens should ideally be dealt with within six months of receipt of application.  However, this business target does not constitute a legal obligation. As the Deputy will appreciate, there is detailed and often complex assessment required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.  </p><p>While the Immigration Service endeavours to have applications of this nature processed as quickly as possible, processing times can vary based on a number of factors. These factors include the number of applications under consideration at the time, the individual circumstances of the applicant and the sponsor, the complexity of applications and whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available to process applications.  Any delays in achieving the business target are primarily related to the processing of more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required.  </p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is decided on its own merits taking all relevant factors into account.  <b></b></p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Report Stage is currently awaited. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap.  The Bill provides for the making of Regulations by the Minister for Justice and Equality requiring employers to publish gender pay gap information. The Regulations would initially apply to firms with 250 or more employees but, over the next few years, this would be reduced to 50 employees. Information on differences in bonus pay will be among the data, which must be published. The Regulations will apply to the public sector as well as the private sector, subject to the employment thresholds. </p>  <p>  It is intended that mandatory reporting will incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. </p>  <p>   Measures such as those included in the Bill have been taken in a number of other countries and, indeed, EU Member States were encouraged to take such measures in an EU Commission Recommendation of 2014.     </p>  <p>  The other gender pay gap measures in the National Strategy for Women and Girls include initiating dialogue between union and employer stakeholders on the matter, increasing understanding of the gender pay gap and its causes and developing practical tools to assist employers to calculate the pay gap within their organisations.  </p>  <p>  Tackling this issue is good for equality and that it makes good business sense, as firms which can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting future employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.  </p></reply>

Under the legislation, a person is of Irish association if they are related by blood, affinity or adoption to, or is the civil partner of, a person (living or deceased) who is/was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen. In such cases, the conditions for naturalisation set out under Section 15 of the Act, including residency may be waived on a discretionary basis.

All applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory conditions for naturalisation as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, such as good character and lawful residence. </p>  <p>   It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases may take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service in cases where the response from the Immigration Service is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

However, I can confirm that the grant aid scheme remains open for applications from interested groups in 2019 and that all fully completed applications received before the end of 2019 will be considered. </p><p>Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have recently expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address </p></reply>

I expect a draft report with options for reform, including possible proposals for legislative change, to be submitted to me in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Review is addressing all of the issues raised in submissions made to it, including those that featured in a recent campaign by the print media. These include:</p><p>-  whether changes should be made to the respective roles of the judge and the jury in High Court defamation cases; and </p><p>-  whether any change should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination.</p><p>The objective set for the defamation review from the outset was to ensure that our defamation law strikes the right balance between protecting an individual&rsquo;s good name and privacy.  Furthermore, our defamation law must protect the right to freedom of expression, taking account of the vital role played by a free and independent press in our democracy.</p><p>This is an important and complex area of legal reform and I can assure the Deputy that is a priority for me and for my Department.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>-  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>-  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>-  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The possibility of establishing a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.  </p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  To date, 21 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;540,000. The location of these approved funding applications, as requested by the Deputy, are as follows: </p><p>-  Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim</p><p>-  Cranmore, Co Sligo</p><p>-  Arklow, Co Wicklow</p><p>-  Courttown/Riverchapel, Gorey and Wexford Town, Co Wexford </p><p>-  Abbeyfeale, Adare, Askeaton, Caherconlish, Cappamore, Castleconnell, Croom, Foynes, Kilmallock, Newcastlewest, Pallasgreen, Patrickswell, Murroe and Rathkeale, County Limerick. </p><p>-  Monaghan Town, Co. Monaghan</p><p>I can confirm that the grant aid scheme remains open for applications from interested groups in 2019 and that all fully completed applications received before the end of 2019 will be considered. </p><p>Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have recently expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address </p></reply>

A weekly personal allowance is paid to each person in a centre and exceptional needs are covered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  My Department requires additional accommodation centres as the number of people arriving to seek our protection continues to rise (figures are up 36% in the first half of this year). There are also now more than 1,300 people placed in emergency accommodation in hotels and guesthouses.  This is a highly unsatisfactory situation and can only be regarded as a short-term solution. The procurement of new accommodation centres has been approached in two ways. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the Department has advertised in the national media for expressions of interest from property owners for a short-term contract (usually one year) to meet demand while the regional tender process is rolled out nationally. Centres in Kenmare, Lisdoonvarna, Mallow, Moate and Wicklow were opened in 2018 through this process. Further centres may also be opened through this process.</p>  <p>  Secondly, my Department is running procurement competitions on a regional basis throughout the country to procure accommodation through the government&rsquo;s procurement portal, Etenders. These contracts will be longer term than the expressions of interest with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. </p>  <p>  Accommodation providers can offer premises both through the expressions of interest process or the tender process. </p>  <p>  The following regional competitions have progressed through the evaluation stage and are in the mobilisation phase; the South East, Midlands and the MidWest Regions.  Evaluation is underway for the South West and Western Regions.  The closing date for bids for the Mid East Region was the 16 September and evaluation will commence shortly. Advertisements for bids for the Dublin Region was published on 18 September and advertisements for the Borders Region are scheduled to be published by the end of this month.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, that until the procurement process, which is commercially sensitive, is complete, it is not possible to confirm any specific locations or premises.</p>  <p>  Tenders received are evaluated on the most economically advantageous tender method which assesses bids on the quality of service as well as price. The level, expertise and qualifications of staff are assessed as part of this process. </p>  <p>  I recently published agreed National Standards for accommodation centres. The Standards will apply to all service providers contracted by the Department to operate and manage accommodation and reception centres. They provide a framework for the continued development of supports and services for residents by improving the quality of care and ensuring consistency across the centres. A copy of the Standards can be found on my Department's website www.justice.ie.</p></reply>

In the first half of this year alone, we have seen a 36% increase in the number of applications received. </p>  <p>  Our 38 existing accommodation centres are currently at full capacity. To ensure that we can continue to provide accommodation for all applicants who require it,  since September 2018, my Department has arranged for the provision of emergency accommodation in hotels and guest houses.  Every effort is being made to re-accommodate residents in these emergency locations to a dedicated accommodation centre as quickly as possible. My Department is actively working on securing additional capacity, both in existing centres and through sourcing new centres via a series of regional procurement competitions and an expression of interest process that was advertised in the national media. </p>  <p>  Currently, we are accommodating 6,056 people across our 38 accommodation centres and a further 1,363 people in 34 emergency accommodation locations. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department regularly engage with other Government Departments and Public Sector organisations to ensure that everyone in the protection process can access the necessary public services and supports.  Regular meetings take place with representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department Education and Skills, and with representatives from the Health Services Executive and the Education and Welfare Service.  </p>  <p>  My Department is represented on the Homeless Interagency Group and the Dublin Joint Homelessness Consultative Forum. My officials also engage on a regular basis with representatives of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive. </p>  <p>  Residents who have been granted an international protection status or a permission to remain have the same access to housing supports and services as Irish and European Economic Area (EEA) nationals. There are currently approximately 900 residents with status or permission to remain. My Department is supporting these residents to move out of our accommodation centres and into secure permanent accommodation. We are providing funding support to DePaul Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust to work with these residents to secure homes. A number of NGOs have also been awarded monies under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). These include the PATHS project and South Dublin County Partnership. Additionally, my Department is liaising with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and with the City and County Managers Association (CCMA) collectively to support residents with status or permission to remain to access housing options.</p></reply>

Each RFT to date has sought to establish a Multi-Supplier Framework for a specific region within the State.

Some of these courses were due to start last July; however, students were allowed to defer their college entry to end September, to allow them to make new arrangements.  Students with proof from a college that they had been accepted onto a course to start by the end of September were granted a temporary Stamp 2 permission. </p>  <p>  The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) have also advised that they will consider the voluntary return of any students rendered destitute because they have lost money as a result of the closure.

Further information is available on the Policing Reform Portal  at the following link   </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, much of the cost of the implementation of this reform process arises against the regular votes of the Departments, organisations and agencies involved.  The vast majority of the costs are in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, including in relation to staffing, training and ICT.  As such, the full costs are not disaggregated and it is not possible to give a full breakdown at this time.</p></reply>

The Irish standards and regulations were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. These standards are in line with those introduced in the UK, which is particularly relevant given the cross-border trade in furniture on the island of Ireland and the presence of furniture manufacturers along the border area.</p>  <p>  The UK has undertaken two consultations (in 2014 and 2016) on the suitability of the UK regulations but has yet to amend its regulations. In view of the similarity of the regulations in both jurisdictions, my Department has liaised very closely with the relevant department in the UK and continues to monitor the situation to keep abreast of developments in that jurisdiction. My Department also liaises, both formally and informally, with other stakeholders in Ireland on the issue.</p>  <p>  Having similar regulations in place on both sides of the border gives consumers clarity and certainty that uniform safety standards apply, while manufacturers have certainty that their products can be sold in both jurisdictions without going to the added expense of manufacturing furniture according to different standards and legislation. Any change in existing regulations, or replacement thereof, will have to provide a robust level of safety when it comes to furniture catching fire. </p>  <p>  My Department is conscious of the need to ensure that if replacement regulations are to be introduced, they must be effective and evidence-based, bearing in mind the tension between short term effects (in relation to flame retardant chemicals providing time to escape a fire and the impact on fire crews&rsquo; operations) and possible long-term health considerations. There is also a need to ensure that if the Regulations are to change there will be no reduction in safety for the consumers of Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department will be issuing a public consultation document on the Irish regulations in the near future. The public consultation will assist the Department in revisiting the current regulations while maintaining a high level of safety with regard to flammability of furniture in Irish homes.</p></reply>

What is being proposed under Sl&aacute;intecare is not simply a reconfiguration of hospital groups, but something much more significant and fundamental. It is the establishment of new health service management structures, which will be tasked with planning, managing and delivering all health and social care services for a given population based on coherent regional areas, on a population health basis. And within these regions, acute hospitals will work with primary, community and social care to provide integrated care. </p><p>As a first step in this process, I announced the areas for six new regional bodies in July. Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan will come within the remit of Area A which is depicted on the map in Appendix A. Details of the geographical areas covered by each new regional health area and the hospitals within these areas is also outlined in the appendix. It is important to note that the Mater Hospital is also within the remit of Area A. </p><p>The announcement of these areas is an important step in signalling the future shape of the health service. A number of pieces of research, analysis and consultation were undertaken to support the identification of the optimal boundaries of the new regions.  This included a review of approaches taken internationally, a review of national policy documents on health reform and previous criteria used in determining regional health bodies, a public consultation process and a detailed analysis of service usage patterns. </p><p>As agreed by Government, my Department will now progress the development of detailed policy proposals on reconfiguration of the HSE, including the establishment of regional health bodies, and bring these proposals back to Government for approval next year. This process will provide an opportunity for further consultation and engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that any structural changes do not unduly cause disruption and loss of focus on service delivery and the roll-out of the broader reform programme, and details of this will be announced in due course. </p><p>I would also like to reassure the Deputy that the announcement of future regional areas will not have any immediate impact on services. As the Deputy is aware, Ireland East Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of re-design work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan Hospital within the current Group and to ensure that it will provide more services safely and appropriately with better linkages to primary, continuing and social care. </p><p>  It is intended that the Hospital Group will continue to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed both in terms of the current Hospital Group configuration and also during the transition to future arrangements. </p><p>  ">Regional Health Areas Map</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

In that context, in March this year I asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence in relation to the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. The evidence review is expected to be completed in March 2020.</p><p>In addition my Department continues to monitor developments and publications by authoritative bodies on the safety of e-cigarettes and whether they facilitate smoking cessation.</p><p>In Ireland e-cigarettes are regulated under the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 271/2016). These Regulations transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014/40/EU). </p><p>Under these Regulations health warnings which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are mandatory. The Regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. </p><p>Finally the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturers, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.  </p><p>In relation to advertising, the Regulations prohibit advertisements for e-cigarettes online and in printed publications except for those directed at persons in the e-cigarette industry or publications printed and published outside the EU and intended for markets outside the EU. In addition, advertisements for e-cigarettes are prohibited on television and on radio. Finally, any form of contribution to an event, activity or person with the aim of promoting e-cigarettes and with a cross-border effect is also prohibited</p><p>In addition to the current legislation my Department is developing a draft scheme for a Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which will include provisions to:</p><p>- introduce a new licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes </p><p>- prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons under the age of 18 </p><p>- prohibit the sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products by persons under the age of 18 </p><p>I intend to bring the draft scheme to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>The current health advice given by the Health Service Executive (&lsquo;HSE&rsquo;) reflects the position from the HIQA research and conclusions. </p><p>The HSE advises people who smoke that currently e-cigarettes are not recommended as a help to stop smoking because the safety and effectiveness profile is uncertain. People who want to stop smoking and /or using e-cigarettes, and who want support, can use HSE QUIT services and access help. Research shows that using stop smoking services like the HSE&rsquo;s QUIT service makes someone twice as likely to quit for good. Even better news is that using stop smoking services in combination with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and stop smoking medication makes people three to four times more likely to quit. The HSE&rsquo;s QUIT service is a free, personal support service to help quitters &ndash; providing a team of trained advisors, online tools, understanding and support. If anyone is thinking of giving up smoking, or is using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, the QUIT service can help over the phone, on Facebook or Twitter, via email or text, or through Live Chat via the support. The QUIT Service also has a network of face-to-face HSE QUIT services in locations around the country, providing one-to-one and group support for smokers.</p></reply>

Finally, any form of contribution to an event, activity or person with the aim of promoting e-cigarettes and with a cross-border effect is also prohibited.</p>  <p>  The current priority in relation to e-cigaretes is the draft scheme under development for a Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill. The Bill will include provisions to prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products such as e-cigarettes by and to persons under the age of 18 and introduce a new licensing system for the retail sale of nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes. </p>  <p>  Neither I, nor my officials have met with representatives of the vaping and e-cigarette industry to date in 2019.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  We intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Support Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government decision in 2013, persons who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed have continued to receive the monthly payment.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputies may wish to note that in July this year, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations.  This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues.  It will support voluntary organisations that provide:</p>  <p>  - Transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or</p>  <p>  - Transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p></reply>

This work, which incorporates consideration of international best practice, is expected to be complete by the end of this year, following which the recommendations will be implemented. </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of funding private smear reviews, this matter remains under consideration. However, in that context it is important to again re-emphasise the limitations of cervical screening, and the fact that false negative results are an inherent part of any cervical screening programme. Cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer and unfortunately some women will still develop cervical cancer despite regular screening. The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, which is the current testing mechanism. I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible and have approved a draft project plan for the HPV primary screening project. Its use will result in fewer false negative results, though it is important to be clear they will continue to occur. </p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. </p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.</p><p>A central finding of the CMO&rsquo;s report is that there are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland concerning the use of mesh implants. Routinely collected clinical activity data does not identify the number of women who have received mesh implants in HSE funded hospitals.  This is being addressed through ongoing work to implement recommendation (iii) above.</p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. </p><p>Pending the completion of this work, the HSE is also examining options to address service requirements for patients with immediate or urgent needs. </p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE has prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019, which I hope provides further clarity on this issue.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department and this report is awaited. </p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.</p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence. It is my intention to meet again with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These have included posts for the HSE's national antimicrobial resistance team, additional posts for laboratory/screening activities, and infection prevention and control teams. </p><p>- A suite of publicly available guidance documents has been developed by the CPE Expert Group.  The Group provides expert advice across health care settings regarding actions that should be taken in relation to CPE screening and control of spread of CPE.  </p><p>- A dedicated HSE communications campaign and website with focused information and education tools is in place. </p><p>While the number of newly diagnosed CPE patients has slightly increased, this is in the context of substantially increased screening activity over the past year. </p><p>Over two years, my Department has provided dedicated AMR funding, totalling &euro;6.6 million in full year costs.  The HSE has prioritised work programmes for this funding in line with HCAI/AMR risk. A number of posts are now in place and new developments are underway.  </p><p>As part of iNAP, enhanced surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial usage patterns, both within and between sectors has commenced with the publication in January 2019 of Ireland&rsquo;s first cross sectoral <i>One Health Report on Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance. </i>Work on a second report is underway.  </p><p>Ireland is hosting a <i>European Commission/European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) One Health AMR Country Visit </i>from 7th - 11th October next. This type of visit to Member States by the Commission and ECDC is an established work programme providing support and advice to countries on their arrangements across the human health, animal health and environmental sectors, with an emphasis on antibiotic resistance and the &lsquo;One Health' or whole of government approach. A programme including a full day of presentations and targeted site visits through the week is now confirmed.  Ireland is very pleased to engage on this programme and notes its value to all participants.</p><p>The Department will continue to engage with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure that AMR, HCAIs and CPE in particular remain a priority.</p></reply>

This outlines key challenges involved, and actions to be taken, to better address the needs of cancer patients and their families. </p>  <p>  While some healthcare professionals already provide the care and support recommended in the Needs Assessment, there is a need to strengthen, standardise and ensure access for patients to good survivorship services and supports across designated cancer centres, other hospitals and primary care services, as well as in community and voluntary services.</p>  <p>  Also, Recommendation 43 of the Strategy highlights the need for the development of dedicated survivorship programmes emphasising the physical, psychological and social factors that affect health and wellbeing.  Arising from this, Cancer &lsquo;Thriving &amp;amp; Surviving&rsquo; Programmes, designed to assist patients in achieving optimal quality of life on completion of treatment, are being undertaken in a number of locations nationwide.</p></reply>

It proposed that the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what measures could be taken over time to address this. It is my view a process should be commenced with the various bodies in the near future. However, any solution has to be realistic and affordable.</p>  <p>  While there are significant recruitment and retention challenges, particularly in certain specialties and less attractive locations at present, the number of consultants employed (whole time equivalents) has continued to increase on an annual basis, typically by over 100 each year and the majority of vacant posts are filled on a locum or agency basis to support service delivery.</p></reply>

In addition, the Department conducted a public consultation on home-care services, on which a report was published in 2018. These reports are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and will help to ensure that the new scheme is informed both by international experience and by the views of stakeholders, including service-users.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the statutory scheme in 2021.  As part of this, work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and in 2019 work is focusing on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation, and a review of existing services.

In addition, tax free incentives are provided when timber is sold and other grant aid provided to construct forest roads. Other models without the use of significant grant aid could have been explored but the State has chosen to fund forestry programmes since the 1990's with a combination of grants and premiums, tax incentives and other supports to assist landowners in the management of their plantations. The continuation of this model over successive Forestry Programmes since 1990 has been the favoured option of all of the relevant stakeholders also.</p><p>This model has resulted in the payment of some &euro;2.4billion directly to farmers by the State since 1990.  </p><p>The current Forestry Programme is 100% exchequer funded and as such it is governed by rules set out under the <i>&quot;European Union Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas 2014 to 2020</i>&quot;. With regard to afforestation, these rules provide for annual premium payments to cover agricultural income forgone and maintenance; they do not provide for payments for carbon.</p></reply>

This includes the designation and approval of border inspection posts at ports and airports. The focus to date has been on infrastructure developments and upgrades at border inspection posts in Dublin port, Rosslare and Dublin airport, due to the volume of trade flows with the UK.    </p>  <p>  The decision to designate or seek approval for facilities at a port or airport to carry out import controls on certain regulated products and live animals is based on trade flow analysis and is typically driven by a request from the authority responsible for that port or airport. </p>  <p>  Once such a request is received, this begins a process to identify where such a facility could be built. The requirements for a border inspection post would be outlined, which would include the inspection facilities and the accommodation requirements for the staff. This facility would need to comply with the relevant EU regulations, and be approved for use by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Port of Cork Company has approached my Department with respect to the establishment of a border inspection post in the Port.  However, in December 2018, they advised my Department that they did not intend to pursue the construction of a border inspection post at that time. </p>  <p>  Although the Port of Cork does not have an approved border inspection post, it is designated as a point of entry for bulk shipments of wood and wood products as outlined in Council Directive 2000/29, as amended. The facility conducting these controls is currently in operation.</p>  <p>  Cork Airport has not engaged with my Department with respect to the potential construction of a border inspection post. </p>  <p>  My Department would consider any requests received on a case-by-case basis but the immediate focus is on preparing for a potential no-Deal Brexit on 31 October within a whole-of-Government approach including further developing our existing border inspection posts. </p></reply>

I recently announced a &euro;10 million energy grant through TAMS, and, in particular, I introduced grant-aid for solar PV installation of up to 6kWp that includes solar photovoltaic panels, an inverter &amp;amp; controller and a solar PV rechargeable battery.  <b></b></p><p>In addition, a variety of energy saving measures such as; LED lighting, plate coolers, heat transfer units and ice builders are available for the Dairy sector under TAMS II.  For the Pigs and Poultry sector, there is a range of grant-aid available including biomass boilers, electrical heat pads, energy efficient LED lighting, indirect heating systems, solar panels for water heating, ventilation fans and control systems, insulation for doors, roofs and walls, air source heat pumps and heat recovery units. Full details of the wide variety of investment items are available on the my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>.</i></p><p>Agri-industry are now also beginning to partner with energy suppliers to increase the renewable energy take-up at farm level. Glanbia Ireland, working in partnership with SSE Airtricity and Activ8 Solar Energies recently introduced FarmGen, a farm generated renewable energy initiative. The initiative will offer complementary support to TAMS and will include installation of a 6Kw Solar PV system and a smart metering system which will monitor energy generation and consumption in real-time and include export meters that will have the ability to potentially profit from future incentives to return electricity on to the grid.</p><p>As we transition to a low-carbon economy and society to meet our EU 2030 targets and move towards carbon neutrality for the agriculture and land use sector, partnerships in the sector have a key role to play in renewable energy as a key supplier of bioenergy feedstock and in the longer term as a renewable energy provider.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements, each animal collector may choose from at least two rendering companies for the disposal of over 48-month animals.

A real-time map showing the ESB charge point locations, including the status and availability of these charge points, is available on the ESB's website at <i>.</i>The ESB has provided a breakdown by county of those chargers that it operates, and is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Standard Charge Points</th><th>Fast Chargers</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>30</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>20</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>18</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>18</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>28</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>22</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>24</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>150</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>28</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>14</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>12</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>26</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>14</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>26</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>14</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>16</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>26</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>26</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>56</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>28</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p><p>The operation and maintenance of these charge points is a matter for ESB eCars and therefore not in my remit. However, my Department has contacted ESB regarding the charge point at Newbridge and was advised that the charge point is to be replaced later this year when eCars takes delivery of new replacement chargers. In addition to these chargers operated by ESB ecars, there are public chargers provided by motor dealerships, local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. </p><p>I am in the process of increasing the level of investment in charging infrastructure. Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, funding of up to &euro;10 million will support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>Last month, I announced funding to support the rollout by Local Authorities of up to 1,000 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles over the next 5 years. This will cater mainly for electric vehicle owners who rely on on-street parking as their primary means of parking near their homes. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will administer a scheme where Local Authorities can apply for funding to develop on-street charging infrastructure. The detailed terms and conditions for the scheme are currently being developed and I expect the scheme to open for applications shortly. </p><p>In addition, we will introduce new regulations to require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging facilities.</p><p>Home charging is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland. Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers.</p></reply>

For this reason the Climate Action Plan includes a target of 936,000 electric vehicles on the road in Ireland by 2030 in addition to a target of increasing our electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% by 2030.</p>  <p>  Currently a typical new battery electric vehicle emits circa 1.25 tonnes of carbon per annum compared to a fossil fuel powered car which emits circa 3 tonnes per annum. As the emissions intensity of electricity decreases, due to increased levels of renewable energy and the end of peat and coal use for electricity generation, the emissions of the battery electric vehicle are expected to fall to circa 0.5 tonnes per annum by 2030, so in 2030 an electric vehicle will produce one sixth of the emissions that a internal combustion engine does today.</p></reply>

The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. These upgrades are provided free of charge to the homeowner. This year I initially allocated &euro;24m to the scheme, and following a mid-year capital review additional funding was made available, bringing the total allocation up to &euro;39.8m. </p><p>Prior to 2018, the Warmer Homes Scheme predominantly focussed on delivering shallow measures such as attic and cavity wall insulation. In 2018, a significant change was introduced to the scheme with the expansion of wall insulation measures available to include internal and external wall insulation as standard. This was a very positive step forward and opened the scheme up to many who would previously have been unable to get their walls insulated.</p><p>This change has meant that windows can also now be provided under the scheme. Window replacement can be recommended in limited circumstances following an SEAI technical survey. This recommendation is typically made in circumstances where only single glaze windows exist and where wall insulation is also being installed. Recommendations are made on a case by case basis.</p><p>Doors are not currently provided under the scheme. </p><p>The following table shows estimates of the approximate cost of providing replacement of single glazed windows and doors under the scheme. The projections are based on 2018 completion rates for homes under the scheme and a number of other assumptions as set out.<table><tr><th>Measure</th><th>Cost </th><th>Assumptions</th></tr><tr><td>Replace single glazed windows</td><td>&euro;3,760,000</td><td>Approx. 12% of homes are now recommended for window upgrades under the scheme.<br /><br />Cost of windows package @ &euro;6,000 per home.<br /><br />2018 completion rates of 5,222 homes.</td></tr><tr><td>Doors</td><td>&euro;2,585,000</td><td>Doors are not currently provided but this projection assumes that 45% of homes would need a replacement door (based on experience in the Warmth and Wellbeing scheme, but no certainty that this would apply if introduced under WHS).<br /><br />Cost of door @&euro;1,100 per home.<br /><br />2018 completion rates of 5,222 homes.</td></tr></table></p><p>The Government published the first Climate Action Plan on 17 June. The plan sets out, for the first time, the actions Ireland needs to take to reach our 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need.

The Government has been preparing for Brexit for over three years to make sure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all scenarios. No-deal preparations have always had the highest priority and intensive engagement with stakeholders across all sectors continues. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the European Commission last year put forward a draft legislative proposal aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no-deal Brexit scenario. The measures provide a degree of certainty to the Irish aviation sector and to the travelling public. </p>  <p>  Under the Common Travel Area (CTA), Irish and British citizens move freely and reside in either jurisdiction and enjoy associated rights and entitlements. Both the Government of Ireland and the UK Government have committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances. In light of these factors, therefore, all direct flights between Ireland and the UK will still be able to operate post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  At present, UK passport holders are processed through the EU channel at Irish airports and this will continue, with the EU channel being re-designated as an EU/UK channel. I understand that Cork Airport has identified all signs that would need to be amended, and will have customer services staff available to direct passengers, as necessary. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the additional agriculture, health and customs checks which will be required at ports and airports in the event of no-deal is being co-ordinated by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The group has focused on three locations which we rely heavily upon for our connectivity, namely, Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort. The Office of Public Works has been tasked with delivering the required facilities for these checks at these locations. Cork Airport is not expected to require any additional infrastructure to deal with any potential changes resulting from the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union. </p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding from Tourism Ireland for cooperative marketing activity. An increased budget allocation in Tourism Ireland for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I continue to encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services.</p></reply>

Valid Irish insurance discs will be accepted as proof of insurance cover.</p>  <p>  A number of small exceptions apply. In relation to Irish registered motorcycles or agricultural tractor vehicles, some of these vehicles display insurance discs and some do not.  In these cases, no additional documentation is required if the vehicle displays a valid Irish insurance disc.  However, if the vehicle does not display a valid Irish insurance disc, it is recommended that a motor insurance certificate or a Green Card is carried in the vehicle.  Any policyholder with an Irish registered vehicle who requests a Green Card from their insurance provider will be issued with one.  </p>  <p>  EU law governs vehicles registered in non-EU countries travelling to the EU. Under the EU Motor Insurance Directive (2009/103/EC), the default position is that Green Cards will be required as proof of motor insurance for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU, including Ireland, post Brexit.  This means that UK and Northern Ireland registered vehicles will require a Green Card if driving to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have made a number of requests to the European Commission regarding its intentions to fix a date under Article 8(2) of the Motor Insurance Directive from which the carrying of Green Cards would not be required after the UK has exited the EU.  While the Commission has confirmed that such a measure is not part of its published Contingency Plan, my officials are continuing to pursue this matter with the Commission.</p></reply>

My Department participates in the co-ordination structures established to facilitate a whole-of-Government response to the issues raised by Brexit, including participation in the interdepartmental group on the EU and Brexit and the Brexit co-ordinators' group.</p><p>Consultations by my Department regarding Brexit with key maritime stakeholders including ports has included a Transport and Logistics All Island Sectorial meeting in Dundalk in January 2017, three Brexit Maritime Transport Workshops/Seminars (in April 2017, March 2018, and in January 2019) with a further Maritime Transport Workshop/Seminar took place earlier this month (September 2019) focussed on Maritime Connectivity and Brexit preparedness.</p><p>I do not believe that tariffs will apply on goods passing through the UK or using the UK landbridge for transit to access the Continental EU market to and from Ireland, as such product is going from one EU market to another and tariffs do not apply between EU countries.  Some tariffs could, of course, apply to goods exported to and imported from the UK.  </p><p>There is potential for the use of the UK landbridge to become disrupted for Irish exporters and importers in a scenario where the Dover - Calais route in particular may become heavily congested in a no-deal Brexit to the extent that significant numbers of Irish businesses may seek alternatives including direct routes to and from France.  My Department together with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) has examined the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge.  Based on extensive consultations with the shipping sector and wider, I believe that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, because of disruption to the UK landbridge, the shipping sector have assured my Department and the IMDO that they can and will respond quickly to meet such demands.  In the context of Brexit, there has already been an additional increased capacity over the past two years on direct routes with more planned for 2020.  My Department has also established that there is capacity in ports other than the two main ports dealing with Roll-on / Roll-off traffic (RoRo) traffic, Dublin and Rosslare, that could be of some assistance in the event of a hard Brexit.  The main spare capacity available in 2019 is in relation to Lift-on/ Lift -off (LO-LO), in particular at the ports of Waterford, Shannon Foynes, and Cork, and for bulk traffic. However, shipping services are market driven and I believe that ferry operators will respond to economic developments and increase or decrease capacity from particular ports in response to market developments.  There have already been responses from the shipping companies adding additional freight capacity on direct sailings to the continent. To take one example, the Port of Cork saw the addition of a new route in May 2018 with Brittany Ferries&rsquo; commencing the service to Santander and Roscoff with the <i>Connemara</i>, whose capacity is 27,414 GT. </p><p>As regards freight train or rail freight capacity, Irish Rail is actively engaging with a number of parties regarding emerging rail freight opportunities within the container and bulk markets and will focus on the commercial, environmental and wider economic value that rail freight offers within these markets.</p></reply>

DCC made bye-laws in the same year for the licensing of horse-drawn carriages under the Local Government Act, 2001.</p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  It is under this Act that local authorities can choose to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.  Some local authorities develop bye-laws to licence horse-drawn carriages operating commercially. Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.</p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this legal basis for making such bye-laws could be uncertain, as the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. </p>  <p>  My Department examined this issue and, following legal advice, is now of the view that the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.  Also, it seems that a simple repeal of the Victorian legislation alone may not be sufficient to enable DCC to enact bye-laws for horse-drawn carriages.  Therefore, my Department is now working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to identify how best to empower DCC to regulate this area.</p></reply>

There is also an offshoot to the core Port of Shannon Foynes. The Dublin-Rosslare Europort rail line, and roadways, link to Rosslare Harbour, a harbour which is on the TEN-T comprehensive Network but which does not meet the threshold for TEN-T core port status.  </p><p>Rosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts, but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  While State investment in relation to the port is not permitted under EU Regulations on State Aid, Project 2040 sets out the Government's plans in relation to roads projects such as the recently opened Gorey to Enniscorthy stretch of the M11 and the planned Oilgate to Rosslare stretch of the N11/N25.</p><p>In relation to the Port, I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  </p><p>As regards the potential for EU funding for the development of Rosslare Europort going forward, the Deputy will be aware that Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T Network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process.</p><p>While the current CEF programme finishes at end 2020, a proposal for a new CEF Regulation for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018. Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.</p><p>Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, including the rail and road network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant calls for proposals.</p><p>With regard to the amending the TEN-T network, the EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc, wrote to EU Transport Ministers in February 2019, announcing that the European Commission is advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. This review process will include: an evaluation study, due to be completed in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation, which was open for contributions from April to July 2019; and targeted consultations with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders later this year. Following the conclusion of the Commission&rsquo;s review, a legislative proposal to amend the TEN-T Regulation may follow.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, in August 2019, honouring a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, I made a submission to Commissioner Bulc on the matter of reviewing the TEN-T network. A copy of that submission is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p></reply>

The <i>Climate Action Plan</i>has set out measures to encourage a transition away from the use of petrol and diesel, particularly towards electrification in the light-duty (passenger car and van) fleets. In addition, Government will also play an important leadership role in promoting and normalising alternatives by investing in low-emissions technology in its bus fleet. </p><p>The transition is, however, not expected to be uniform across all vehicle sectors.  The development of electrified fleet is not yet as advanced in the coach sector as it is for passenger cars, vans and low-floor buses.  Thus, in the short to medium term, other alternative fuels which are already commercially available - such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biofuels - may have a role to play in the heavy-duty sectors where electrification is not yet commercially viable.</p><p>Generally, as new fuels and technologies advance, production levels increase and more vehicle models become available and cheaper in the coming years, so these new technologies are expected to reach total cost of ownership parity as we move towards 2030, making the switch easier and cost-effective for both business and private consumers.  Also, developments in the cost of diesel over time, amongst other factors, may position ultra-low emission and zero-emission fuels as an increasingly attractive and viable investment for Irish businesses.</p><p>I expect that the anticipated improvements in alternatively-fuelled vehicle technology, reductions in purchase prices, increased driving range and model availability, coupled with a strong Government commitment to invest in the recharging network, will have a positive impact in uptake and consequently in driving further market development. </p><p>Policy about the supports and measures to underpin the transition will be kept under constant consideration and I will continue to work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to make the transition to electrification, and to other ultra-low emission alternatives, as efficiently as possible.</p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. </p>  <p>  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May.</p>  <p>  Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works, including an application from the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have all applications assessed with allocations announced shortly after that.  </p>  <p>  As soon as allocations have been made, my Department will carry out a review of all aspects of the 2018 round of the programme to include any possible improvements for the future. This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round but I fully expect that the SCP will again be open for new applications before the end of this year.   </p></reply>

Recommendations concerning the latter two bodies are a matter, as the Deputy will be aware, for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The report makes some recommendations regarding Tusla including (i) having an outside body established to hold Tusla to account; (ii) rectifying difficulties in relation to hiring and retaining staff; and (iii) the timely response to FOI requests.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the first recommendation, it should be noted that the Health Information and Quality Authority is an independent body, established by the Health Act 2007, which inspects Tusla services against relevant statute (both primary and secondary) as well as agreed standards. Reports of their findings are published regularly on their website.  </p>  <p>  Tusla is proactively working on the challenges associated with the hiring and retention of staff. To this end it has established Tusla Recruit (in 2016) to assist in the recruitment and retention of qualified and experienced staff; it is in the process of developing multi-year workforce planning and is currently working with Third Level Institutions to provide additional study places for key Tusla grades. In addition, Tusla hosted its first ever national recruitment open day to hire additional social work staff in June 2019.  </p>  <p>  Finally, in common with all bodies to whom the Freedom of Information Act applies, Tusla is bound by the requirements and timescales as set out in that Act.</p></reply>

Tusla continuously monitors expenditure in the area of private residential care, and my Department liaises with Tusla on an on-going basis in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  Continuous recruitment of foster carers is a crucial factor insuring children are not placed in residential care due to a shortage of available foster carers. HIQA inspections of Tusla's fostering activities has frequently shown a range of creative approaches employed by Tusla areas to recruit and retain an appropriate range of experienced foster carers. These approaches include public events and workshops, and local media campaigns.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has responsibility for the care and protection of all children in the care of the State. Where the identified needs of a child cannot be met by foster care, a residential placement may be more appropriate. If the residential centres operated by Tusla cannot meet the needs of a child a private provider may be used. This may include children who require more intensive supports, or situations where Tusla-operated centres do not have available spaces.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that children in private residential placements remain in the care of Tusla, and that Tusla continues to have responsibility for making sure that the needs of the child are met and that the best interests of the child are considered.</p>  <p>  All residential centres for children are subject to, and inspected against, the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres. HIQA are responsible for the inspection of centres operated by Tusla. All inspection reports are published, and available online.</p>  <p>  Under part VIII of the Child Care Act 1991, non-statutory residential care centres for children are inspected and registered by Tusla. The registration cycle outlined under the legislation is three years, and centres are inspected at least twice per three-year cycle. Where concerns are identified, or when conditions are attached to registrations by the inspectorate, follow up inspections are also conducted. Inspections can be announced or unannounced. Staffing and management of the centres are inspected against standards, which includes ensuring that an appropriate number of qualified staff are in place and that evidence of qualifications and CPD are on staff files.</p></reply>

This funding complements the already established Community Smoke Alarm Scheme, so a suite of safety measures is available to those who otherwise might not be able to afford them. </p><p>It should be noted that the carbon monoxide alarms pilot programme anticipated the installation of 2,000 Carbon Monoxide alarms.  However, I understand that savings secured through the procurement process will enable a significant number of additional alarms to be provided within the existing budget, and the scheme continues to remain open for further applications.

As of end of July 2019, there were 82,015 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million. </p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  However, in order to support a carers continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 15-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2006,the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  </p>  <p>  Any further changes to this condition would need to be considered in a budgetary context and would also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the requirement to provide full-time care for the care recipient and the needs of the carer.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In that regard I am currently reallocating resources to this issue to understand, measure and quantify better the prevalence of false self-employment and obtain a sectoral analysis of its level of incidence. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide figures on money recouped on the sole basis of false self-employment cases alone.  However, as an indication of the level of work going on in relation to PRSI inspections generally, a total of 1,931 employer inspections have been carried out across the country by my Inspectors this year up to the end of last month. The savings achieved so far this year from all PRSI inspections carried out comes to a total of &euro;1.184m.  False self-employment cases form a portion of those figures.</p>  <p>  My Department is already focused on increasing the number of employer inspections it conducts nationwide.  Based on experience from these inspections, and recognising that that there is a particular challenge when dealing with large companies or companies with complex legal structures, I also established a dedicated team to work strategically in this area.  This team has commenced its work, in parallel with other Inspectors across the country. </p>  <p>  My officials work in cooperation with the inspectorates of the Workplace Relations Commission and Revenue Commissioners as necessary and strong liaisons have been established with those organisations to focus strategically on tackling false self-employment.</p>  <p>  In addition to more rigorous policing of existing law, I intend to introduce a number of new legislative measures to further strengthen our powers. These measures include putting the 'Guidance on Determining Employment Status' &ndash; which is a revision of the former Code of Practice in this area &ndash; on a statutory footing.  </p>  <p>  I also will bring forward new provisions to address the potential victimisation of workers who seek a determination on their employment status.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Employment policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and Future Jobs Ireland strategies have created an environment in which business can succeed and has led to the creation of more than 500,000 jobs since 2012.  Secondly, through the <i>Pathways to Work </i>strategy, my Department ensures that as many of these new jobs as possible are filled by jobseekers, particularly the young unemployed. </p><p>To date these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment.  The number of young people in employment has increased by almost 25% since 2012, with 250,000 young people now at work.</p><p>Recently released data from the CSO, Labour Force Survey shows that youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% (66,500) in 2012 to 15.7% (46,100) in the second quarter of 2019. Volatility is a big feature of the youth labour force structure, particularly in the context of youth unemployment, as young people are more inclined to move in and out of education or change jobs. </p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a personal progression plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include availing of further education and training opportunities.</p><p>For those who do not find employment through this process, additional offers are provided for through further education and training programmes or in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth. Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment service that provides additional resources and case managed supports to those long-term unemployed.  </p><p>In October 2018, I introduced a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long term unemployed or who face significant barriers to employment.  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) provides young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic and social skills in a supportive work-based environment.  Over 400 young jobseekers have participated in the scheme to date, receiving a payment of &euro;229.50 per week. My Department is currently promoting the scheme to employers as part of a series of employer roadshow events.</p><p>My Department continues to review its activation programmes and policies to make sure that they remain aligned to labour market needs.  Given the progress made during the lifecycle of <i>Pathways to Work</i><i>2016-2020 </i>and the improved nature of the labour market, preparations have begun to develop a revised activation framework for the coming period.  The new Pathways to Work strategy, covering the period 2020-2024, will complement the ambitions of Future Jobs Ireland, with a particular focus on increasing participation levels among underrepresented groups and those most distant from the labour market, including young jobseekers,  ensuring that all jobseekers have the opportunity to compete for available job vacancies.</p><p>Over the coming years, we must ensure that our citizens are equipped with the skills to take up jobs of the future and avail of the opportunities arising from a modern economy.  <i>Future Jobs Ireland </i>has been launched by Government replacing the <i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>to deliver the required policy reforms to build a resilient workforce and innovative and competitive economy in a changing world of work.  The strategy includes a number of youth specific measures which will be delivered on a whole of Government basis.</p></reply>

Crucially though this interim TCA facilitates up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods to be added to paid contributions to increase a person&rsquo;s rate.  It effectively meant that the minimum number of paid contributions of 20 years needed for a full rate pension would be as the National Pensions Framework suggested.  However the additional scope for home caring would potentially allow more people, particularly women who took time out of the work place to care for children and others, to earn a higher rate pension.</p>  <p>  PRSI contributions can be credited to people in a number of contexts and as such up to 10 years of credits, for example Jobseekers or illness Benefit, may also be used subject to the total of such credits and HomeCaring periods not exceeding 20 years.  For example a person might receive a maximum pension based on a record of 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseekers credits, and 15 years HomeCaring (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years. </p>  <p>  There will be some people who have contributed less frequently into the Social Insurance Fund (which pays for contributory pensions), and who will therefore be below the threshold required for a maximum rate of the State pension (contributory). However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;237 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension). This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance. Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the introduction of the interim TCA model will not bring all pensioners up to the maximum rate of State pension (contributory).  However, if a pensioner does not qualify for an increased rate, they will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</p>  <p>  Up to 2011, the scheme provided a rebate of 60 per cent to employers who provided statutory redundancy payments to their employees.  I am advised by my Department that in Budget 2013, the rebate payment was abolished.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund during a time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefiting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. It was not a targeted use of the resources of the Social Insurance Fund. </p>  <p>   The redundancy payments scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments.  Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, while continuing to trade, are required to submit verified financial information to prove this and are liable to the Social Insurance Fund for any redundancy payments made on their behalf.   This ensures that the current scheme takes into account both an employer's ability to pay redundancy payments and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer's financial position improves.</p>  <p>   Any proposals to restore the redundancy rebate scheme and any development of policy in this area would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.  It also seeks to alleviate child poverty.  To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. The family income must also be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  In assessing weekly family income for WFP purposes, most weekly social welfare payments are taken into consideration.  Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of carer&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments. Moreover, while this measure reduced a person&rsquo;s secondary payment (WFP) it did so without affecting their primary payment, in this case carer&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance, therefore targeting available resources at those in most need.</p>  <p>  The income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system. The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.</p>  <p>  Welfare expenditure plays a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  I am advised that an estimated cost of disregarding carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit in the means assessment of the working family payment is not readily available.</p>  <p>Any changes to the current arrangements regarding any social welfare payment would have expenditure implications, which could only be decided in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important that all schemes operated by my Department are subject to on-going control reviews and eligibility checks. </p>  <p>  My Department conducted over 742,000 claims reviews during 2018. As part of the new Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2019-2023 published last week, my Department aims to conduct over 750,000 reviews in 2019.  This is a key element of the "Detect" pillar in the Strategy where the overall goal is to detect instances of suspected fraud and error as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  Reviews take place across the range of schemes operated by my Department and can take a variety of forms. These include desk-based assessments of customer claims, face-to-face interviews with customers by trained investigators, home visits, audits of employers&rsquo; PRSI records, specialist investigations, self-declarations by customers and joint enquiries and operations with other State agencies, including Revenue. Reviews looking at the medical conditionality underpinning certain schemes will also be undertaken.  </p>  <p>  Reviews arise from both targeted and random case selections and where specific information comes to the attention of the Department.  In this context, it should be noted that customers are under a legal obligation to report any change in their circumstances (income or means) to the Department and such notifications may also trigger a review of a person's entitlement. </p>  <p>  Control review work in my Department generated over &euro;2.5 billion in control savings over the lifetime of the previous Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014-2018. Control savings represent the value of prevented expenditure over a future period that would have been incurred if investigative, anti-fraud and control work had not been carried out across the range of schemes administered by the Department. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a lump sum payment between &pound;100stg and &pound;300stg and in most cases it is paid automatically between November and December, to qualified persons.  I also understand that as of winter 2012/13, people who live in the EEA or Switzerland who have &ldquo;a genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK are potentially eligible to receive the WFP, regardless of whether they previously had entitlement to it whilst living in the UK.  This change occurred, following the 2011 European Court of Justice ruling (the &lsquo;Stewart Case&rsquo;).  Prior to that, only people who had an entitlement to WFP before moving from the United Kingdom were eligible.</p>  <p>   Our Fuel Allowance Scheme represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is means tested and is paid only to customers who are getting a qualifying payment, either a State Pension or a means-assessed payment.  The rate of fuel allowance is &euro;22.50 per week or &euro;630.00 annually.  Currently the fuel season is 28 weeks, and the allowance can be paid weekly or in two lump sums of &euro;315 each, being at the start of the fuel season in October and at the midway point in January. </p>  <p>  Post-Brexit, including in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Irish and British citizens will continue to enjoy the right to travel, live and work between the UK and Ireland in the same manner as before.  This is because of a long-standing arrangement known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it.  Both the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom are committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances and we signed a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect on the 8 May 2019.</p>  <p>As part of that commitment, the Government entered into a Convention on Social Security with the Government of the United Kingdom signed on the 1st  February 2019, which replicates the current arrangements that apply to the coordination of social security benefits between the two jurisdictions.  The WFP is not paid on a reciprocal basis and I can confirm that there are no provisions in the Convention which will change the existing practices in relation to these payments.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing programme of service modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have and are  been implemented in recent years. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  </p>  <p>   All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.

Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  Appeal processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.  There has been some improvement in 2019.

The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p>  <p>   There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person of the Department.

Under the scheme, an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a gross weekly salary ceiling of &euro;600.</p>  <p>  In order to be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must: have at least two years continuous service; be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; be over the age of 16; and have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</p>  <p>  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments in the first instance. Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make statutory redundancy payments directly to those employees. Payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund.  Such payments raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.  </p>  <p>  Any proposed changes in this area would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted by my Department to deliver the service.  </p>  <p>  The JobPath employment service commenced in 2015 and, under the terms of the contracts signed with the providers was to run for at least six years comprising two consecutive phases: phase one entailed four years&rsquo; of client referrals, while phase two entailed a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients were to be referred.  Therefore client referrals were due to cease on 31st December 2019.

This interim pension calculation is based on a requirement of forty years of social insurance contributions for qualification for maximum rate pension.  The measures also provide for inclusion of up to twenty years of HomeCaring periods for time spend out of the workforce for parenting or caring reasons.</p>  <p>  Homecaring periods are not time bound, they can occur at any time during a claimant's working life.  This differs from the existing Homemakers scheme, which applies a disregard for periods out of the workforce for caring duties, after April 1994, under the yearly averaging system.  This additional scope for homecaring periods provides an opportunity for those awarded under Budget 2012 rate bands, particularly women, who took time out of the work place to care for children and others, to achieve a higher rate of pension.  The maximum number of combined HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits that can be used as part of the new pension calculation is 1,040 (or 20 years) as provided for under the Social Welfare Pensions &amp;amp; Civil Registration Act 2018. </p>  <p>  The person concerned applied for and was awarded a reduced rate State pension (contributory) in 2016.  As their spouse was already in receipt of an increase for qualified adult for them at a higher weekly rate of entitlement, their state pension (contributory) claim was subsequently withdrawn.</p>  <p>  In July 2019, the person submitted an application for HomeCaring Periods and was awarded 1,279, the maximum possible number of HomeCaring periods in respect of time spent parenting their children. The person concerned has 755 paid social insurance contributions, which, when combined with the maximum permissible number of HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits of 1,040, results in a overall usable total of 1,795.  When this number (1,795) is divided by 2,080 (equivalent to 40 years), this results in a payment entitlement rate of 86.30% of the maximum rate of pension.  As the person concerned is already in receipt of a rate equivalent to 89.6% of the maximum rate of pension, (or &euro;222.50 per week), they are financially better off to remain as a qualified adult on their spouse's pension.</p>  <p>  A review outcome letter has issued to the person concerned, which includes a copy of their social insurance contribution record.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including the number of dwellings in the ownership of each local authority and percentages vacant.  The most recent report, relating to 2017, is available on the NOAC website at the following link: .  </p><p>While the NOAC statistics capture the number of voids at a particular point in time, the reality is that the number of void properties, both nationally and in each individual local authority area, changes on an ongoing daily basis. This is as would be expected in the management of over 130,000 homes, where tenants move in and out regularly. My Department is continuing to engage with local authorities, to support them in returning both short and longer-term vacant properties to use as swiftly as possible. Elected Councils also have a role to play in supporting this work by making adequate budgetary provision for housing repairs and maintenance, utilising the housing rental income available to them. </p></reply>

Payment and Availability Agreements in respect of each dwelling have been signed between the AHB and the particular local authority making the tenant allocation in respect of that dwelling. There are two local authorities involved in the referenced development. </p>  <p>  It is a term of the agreement between the AHB and the local authorities involved that the AHB agrees to charge, collect and retain from the occupants of the dwellings the rent calculated in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s Differential Rent Scheme. The two local authorities involved have different differential rent schemes and the calculation of rent is therefore different. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been able to make their own rent schemes since 1986 and different approaches have been taken to rent charging and setting across the country. There are currently 36 differential rents schemes in operation nationwide.  This may result in a situation where housing authority tenants living quite close to each other, and having similar incomes, are paying different rents because they reside in different administrative areas.  This is a feature of the local government system and of the fact that rent setting is currently a matter for each housing authority.  </p>  <p>  While the case of one development straddling a county border may be unusual, it is not, in principle, different from other situations where tenants on the same income pay different rents.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national  differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents relating to household income.</p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are as follows:</p><p>- A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount;</p><p>- Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000;</p><p>- Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p><p>- Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well;</p><p>- For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well. </p><p>Work is at an advanced stage of development for the new scheme.

Households on HAP are given the opportunity when coming into the scheme to indicate whether they have an interest in going onto a transfer list for local authority or Approved Housing Body owned housing. Allocations to such housing are in accordance with the relevant local authority's allocation scheme. </p>  <p>  Under HAP, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented market. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). Where a tenancy is ending, the household will need to seek alternative accommodation in the private rented market. If a household encounters challenges in securing alternative accommodation, my Department has put both financial and personnel resources in place in local authorities to assist through the HAP Placefinder.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of HAP in the specified location, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has confirmed that they are presently supporting three HAP tenancies at that location and that the Council has not, to date, had any contact from those tenants in respect of eviction notices or notices of termination.</p>  <p>  As regards evictions, as you will be aware, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019, with one of its key functions being to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial and independent role of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in specific disputes.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants under the Residential Tenancies Acts. Section 34 of the 2004 Act provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the allowable grounds for terminations. Through an amendment introduced in 2016, where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances. In addition, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she intends to sell the property, he/she must enter into a contract for sale within 9 months of the termination date and, if not, must offer to re-let to a former tenant who provides their contact details. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Act also provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish/renovate the property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant who provides their contact details, upon completion of the works. Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment/renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such  a risk would be likely to exist for at least 3 weeks. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Act provides additional powers for  the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions. My Department will continue to keep the effectiveness and enforcement of the security of tenure provisions in the Acts under review.</p></reply>

The CSO reports there were 18,016 new dwelling completions in Ireland in 2018, up 25% on 2017. When account is taken of the 817 homes completed in unfinished housing developments and the 2,627 homes that were vacant for at least two years and have been returned to use, the overall number of new homes becoming available for use in 2018 was 21,460, without counting the new student bed spaces that were also brought in during that time.</p>  <p>  The number of residential completions for 2019 will not be known until early 2020. However, trends indicate the continued expansion of supply.  For example, in the year to end June 2019, the number of new homes becoming available for use increased further to 22,609. In the same period, the number of new homes in respect of which commencement notices were served reached 24,226, a 29% year on year  increase. Furthermore, the rolling annual total of planning permissions for residential dwellings has exceeded 30,000 units for the first time since early 2010, up more than 21% year on year. There has been particularly strong growth in apartment planning permissions, which is very welcome given the policy thrust toward more compact urban growth. </p>  <p>  This data provides confidence that the increasing trend in new homes delivery will continue and that the target set in that regard in Rebuilding Ireland will be achieved, supported by a range of supply-focused actions, such as streamlined and updated planning arrangements, investments in infrastructure and new apartment development and heights guidelines, are delivering results.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. </p><p>Previously, for an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must have satisfied the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016), as follows: </p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (i.e the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,169.12 per month in Q1 2019). </p><p>However, on 30 May 2019, I signed the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (Commencement) Order 2019 which appointed 31 May 2019 and 4 June 2019 as the dates on which specified provisions of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 came into effect, including provisions in respect of the average rent qualifying criterion for RPZ designation.  Specifically, in relation to criteria (ii) above, the rent of a dwelling in the Greater Dublin Area (Kildare, Wicklow and Meath) will now be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Dublin rents; and the rent of a dwelling outside of the Greater Dublin Area will be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Greater Dublin Area rents.  </p><p>Each quarterly RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. The quarterly Rent Index Reports are available to view on the RTB's website at the following link: . </p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at , by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'. </p><p>While rental inflation in the Athy LEA has been above 7% in 4 of the last 6 quarters, the standardised average rent in Athy in Q1 2019 was &euro;801.55, which is below the Non-Dublin Standardised Average Rent of &euro;879.25 per month, thereby not satisfying the criteria for designation as an RPZ.</p></reply>

New LEAs and Municipal Districts for County Kildare, which gave effect to this recommendation, were signed into law on 19 December 2018 through the County of Kildare Local Electoral Areas and Municipal Districts Order 2018.</p>  <p>  However, Section 24A(6) or the Residential Tenancies Acts provides that &lsquo;Where a local electoral area is prescribed by order as an RPZ and, subsequently, any local electoral areas are duly amended in a manner that affects the area of the local electoral area so prescribed, then the order shall continue to have effect as if the local electoral area concerned had not been so amended.&rsquo; </p>  <p>   Therefore, under Section 24A(6), areas already designated as RPZs will remain designated and areas that are not designated will retain their current undesignated status and as such will not become a RPZ by virtue of the change to the boundary. Monasterevin, which was previously in an undesignated LEA, therefore remained undesignated.</p>  <p>  Under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 the expiry date of all deemed and designated RPZs is extended to 31 December 2021.</p></reply>

It was first confirmed in the wild in Ireland in July 2019. The first two positive tests recorded were  from rabbits &ndash; one in Wicklow, the other in Clare. The first report of and RHD2 positive test in an Irish hare came on the 9<sup>th</sup>August &ndash; an animal found dying in the Wexford Slobs Nature Reserve. The disease has now been confirmed from six different counties &ndash; Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford.</p><p>A post mortem of each dead animal has been carried out by qualified personnel in the regional laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM). Tissue samples have then been sent to that Department&rsquo;s specialist virology lab in Backweston where the RHD tests take place. </p><p>Most of the research available on the particular strain of virus, RHD2, comes from rabbits to date.  From this work, and some investigations in a number of hare populations around Europe, we know that the RHD2 strain is highly contagious and has led to significant declines in wild rabbit populations across Europe since it first appeared in 2010. It has also been reported from several different species of hares. </p><p>The disease is density-dependent (i.e. the higher the density of animals the higher the incidence of the disease). The virus is extremely resistant, remaining viable for up to two months in the environment. It can be passed on by direct contact, in faeces (including the faeces of predators that have consumed infected animals) and in urine. Infected carcasses can harbour infective virus for several months post mortem. The virus can also be transported on soil, shoes and on clothing.  Environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses. There is no cure for the disease and while some animals are believed to be carriers and thus apparently immune, mortality of up to 70% is possible.</p><p>In an effort to reduce the spread of the disease, biosecurity measures have been put in place at the two NPWS Nature Reserves where the disease has been located &ndash; Wexford Wildlife Reserve and Boora Bog. The Office of Public Works have also implemented biosecurity measures at Scattery Island &ndash; one of the locations in Clare where the disease has been confirmed.</p><p>There is an effective vaccine against RHD2 available for domestic rabbits. However, this has not been tested on wild rabbits and has not been tested on hares.<b></b>Licensing of vaccines for use on wild hares would require authorisations from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and also potentially the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>My Department's NPWS Staff are continuing to monitor reports of wild rabbit and hare deaths to gain a fuller understanding of the extent and impact of this disease in Ireland. At least 4 more hares from three different counties are currently with DAFM for testing.</p></reply>

Such supports include pilot projects aimed at increasing and enhancing access to drama and group singing activities for young people in partnership with Youth Theatre Ireland and Sing Ireland respectively.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Creative Ireland Programme&rsquo;s National Creativity Fund is supporting a number of initiatives which are designed to support young performers, including the </p>  <p>-  Royal Irish Academy of Music development of Le Ch&eacute;ile, music ensembles for young disabled musicians;</p>  <p>-  Irish Chamber Orchestra&rsquo;s establishment of the Limerick City Youth Orchestra for 12 to 18 year olds; and</p>  <p>-  Ireland&rsquo;s National Musical Instrument Resource which is seeking to ensure that no one, regardless of age or socio-economic background, is prevented from fulfilling their creative potential for lack of access to an appropriate musical instrument.</p>  <p>  My Department has a range of other supports which may benefit young performers, such as the Music Capital Scheme which provides funding for the purchase of equipment by performing groups and individual talented musicians.
