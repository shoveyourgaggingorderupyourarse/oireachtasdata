    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300079#WRB00400"><p>This Government is committed to a new national afforestation programme which will benefit farmers, the sector, the environment and society at large. This is clearly set out in the Programme for Government which is ambitious for the future of Irish forestry.   While it's well known that forestry has had its share of its difficulties in recent times, which we are addressing, there is enormous potential for a new model of forestry to deliver multi-functional benefits for society.</p>  <p>  As a result of delays in finalising the new CAP and new State Aid rules, the current Forestry Programme which operates under the same Sate Aid rules as CAP will now likely extend to end 2021. A new Forestry Programme will be required for the next period and we will have the opportunity to look afresh at what we want from forestry as landowners, communities, businesses and state enterprises.  </p>  <p>  I believe that any new Programme must align fully with other agricultural schemes, particularly to encourage uptake by farmers. Combining woodland creation with farming is the future if we are to meet our afforestation targets.  If farm forestry is to succeed in the decades ahead it must deliver an economic return for the farmer in a way that complements and enhances the farming enterprise. </p>  <p>  Future woodland creation on farms must strike a more even balance between ecosystem service delivery and timber production. In terms of eco-system delivery there are lots of options to consider. Agroforestry for example will allow farming to continue on land also planted with trees.  Fast growing trees for renewable energy can be used to fuel on-farm biomass boilers; shelterbelts can  enhance animal welfare while also increasing grass growth, planting tree species rich in nectar and pollen will support pollinators.</p>  <p>  We already have an ambitious  target to increase forest  cover to 8,000 hectares per year under the Climate Action Plan and this Governemt is committed to enacting a new Climate Bill soon. It's obvious that any future woodland creation  towards that target must have a much greater focus on delivering environmental benefits, to include for example enhancing water quality, habitat creation and climate adaption measures. To deliver on these aims there will have to be greater emphasis on species diversity particularly native species. Sustainable forest management is also  key.  We will need to  incentivise continuous cover forestry on suitable sites, moving away from clearfell and replanting where possible and have more strategic planting to alleviate the risk of flooding and to create filtration buffers along watercourses to protect aquatic habitats.  </p>  <p>  We will be announcing a public consultation process for the new Forestry Programme shortly, which will also encompass a new Forestry Strategy. It is intended that a wide range of stakeholders will take part  and I anticipate  that it  will deliver a multitude of  ideas to help form a sustainable forestry model for Ireland.  We look forward to active and constructive engagement from all interested parties across society to help shape this new vision.  </p></reply>

As I have stated, this Policy Directive provided that vessels over 18m LOA (Length Overall) will be excluded from trawling activity inside six nautical miles, including inside the baselines, from 1 January 2020. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. An unapproved judgement was issued on 31 July 2020 and the key points to come out of that Judgement is that while the applicants did not succeed on four of the five grounds of challenge, the challenge was made against the entire Policy Directive 1 of 2019 and was successful. </p><p>The findings on the grounds of challenge were: <ol type="1"><li>The Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was not ultra vires, </li><li>The Directive did not impinge the applicants constitutional rights.</li>/<li>Given the impact on the applicants there was a particular duty on the Minister to provide a fuller explanation and engage in further talks with the applicants. On this ground the applicantssucceeded.</li><li>The policy directive was not disproportionate to what was to be achieved.</li><li>The Policy directive did not breach EU law. </li></ol>On 6<sup>th</sup>October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p><p>The breach of fair procedures as I have just referenced related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p><p>I am currently considering, on an urgent basis, the implications of the judgment in consultation with my legal advisors.</p><p>I should advise the Deputy that I am committed to the sustainability of fishing in Irish waters and the commitment made in our Programme for Government that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and pair trawling be prohibited inside the six-mile limit. . </p></reply>

Within this proposal, the NIFF also requested that, if the proposal was supported, a review should be carried out after 12 months to ensure that no other vessels are disadvantaged because of the increase.  </p>  <p>  The Minister adopted the NIFF&rsquo;s proposal taking into account that the 400 tonnes quota limit set had not been fully utilised by the relevant vessels in previous years. The Minister considered  that the request to increase the per trip catch limit from 500kg to 750 kg, representing a 50% increase in the limit,  could be accommodated within the existing 400 tonnes quota limit set for the fishery.   On 28th April 2020, the Minister approved the request to raise the per trip limit to 750 kg from 500 kg.   However, there was concern that this increase could disadvantage smaller vessesl and accordingly it is planned to reveiw the trip limit set should the allocation be exhausted early in 2020 or future years. </p>  <p>  I will examine all aspects of this quota limit before the commencement of this fishery next year to determine if the trip limit set supports the fishery for the vessels in the category and taking into account if the fishery has been operating within the quota limit set for it.</p></reply>

The approval process also checks that applications comply with all legislation on contents and efficacy.</p><p>The hand sanitiser Virapro was approved by our Biocides Unit and registered on the 21st April 2020 on the basis of the documentary application, including a technical specification that it contained 70% ethanol which is a common standard for hand sanitiser products and fully complies with regulations.</p><p>Following investigations, laboratory results received on 16<sup>th</sup>October showed that the products did not meet the standards for approval, particularly with regard to the presence of methanol.</p><p>The company was immediately instructed to retain all product in its possession and recall all remaining product under the Virapro name from the market or in use by the public.</p><p>On the 20<sup>th</sup>October Virapro hand sanitiser was removed from the Department's Biocides Register. </p><p>The primary responsibility for the withdrawal of products rests with the company concerned. On Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup>October it became evident on the basis of communication from the company that the recall of products had not yet commenced.</p><p>At that point my Department took the additional step of issuing a statement outlining the possible risks posed by Virapro and advising members of the public not to use it.  My Department also issued formal notification to Departments of Education, Health and Children. I was informed of the situation by my Department for the first time on the evening of 22<sup>nd</sup>October.</p><p>We are taking this matter very seriously, and will continue to follow up and investigate as appropriate.  </p><p>My Department is continuing to increase its testing of product on the market to provide reassurance in relation to compliance with approved product specifications. Test results available so far indicate no safety issues with other sanitiser products sampled.</p></reply>

I know that this is impacting  directly on the sector. This is a something  I take very seriously as I am aware of  how important this sector is to the rural economy and to the delivery of wood products.</p>  <p>  To give some context to the current situation the delays in issuing licences originates from recent case law from the European Court of Justice and  the High Court . This has  changed how the Department implements environmental law and has resulted in the introduction of  a revised Appropriate Assessment Procedure for forestry licensing.  This procedure aims to protect the integrity of sensitive European Natura sites, which is guaranteed under the Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  These changes in process are very significant requiring new guidelines, standards and protocols and have taken time to develop, and this has led to delays in the issuing of licences. It was important to put in place a robust system to underpin licensing approval, in order that all environmental  requirements are met and that applicants may have confidence in approvals granted.  The procedure now in place meets all regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>  The backlog which arose due to these changes must be addressed and my  Department has taken significant steps to do so. We have invested heavily in extra  ecologists and forestry inspectors in order to deal with these licences.  A project plan, which takes a systematic approach to clearing files, is in operation. It has defined targets and a Project Management Board which meets weekly to monitor progress. In terms of felling licences we are seeing early progress and we expect to issue licences for over 750,000m3 of timber in October which will be highest amount in 15 months. </p>  <p>  In relation to your specific question, there are 1,062 private felling files awaiting completion of the Appropriate Assessment  process. If these require a  2nd stage Appropriate Assessment , the applicant may provide a Natura Impact Statement or in the absence of that the Department's ecologist  will complete an Appropriate Assessment Report. </p>  <p>  If an applicant submits a Natura Impact Statement this will significantly reduce the time taken to issue a licence.  In addition to private felling there are 1,132 Coillte files on hand.  Coillte generally provide a Natura Impact Statement if required, which the Department then assesses by means of an Appropriate Assessment Determination.</p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the challenge we face in accelerating the number of felling licences issued or the task of ensuring that adequate appropriate assessment is carried out. The felling of trees is an important resource for our timber industry, and provides income to, among others,  the many farmers who invested their land in forestry. My Department is committed to facilitating this  mobilisation of timber, while respecting the environmental requirements of Natura sites.  </p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States.</p>  <p>  Two issues have now arisen </p>  <p>1.  The new requirement under EU Law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and</p>  <p>2.  The question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the Regulation which permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the first issue, since 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  Scientific evidence is now available showing that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. Therefore, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. Ireland has no national discretion on this issue.</p>  <p>  On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the Regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a Member State's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019/6 coming into force in January 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland's national legislation has never permitted anyone other than a veterinarian to issue a veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland has no national discretion to now provide for a regime which would permit Responsible Persons in Licensed Merchants or pharmacists to dispense antiparasitic veterinary medicines without a veterinary prescription issued by a veterinarian.</p>  <p>  I recognise these legislative changes will result in challenges for all impacted stakeholders.   My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products.    </p></reply>

This 2050 target being set in law by the Climate Action Bill is to achieve a &lsquo;climate neutral economy,&rsquo; that balances emissions and removals within the State, by the end of 2050.</p>  <p>  This is a very ambitious target, and every sector, including Agriculture will contribute to meeting this target by implementing policy changes. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises the &lsquo;special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the United Nation&rsquo;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&rsquo;. This does not let agriculture off the hook. Emissions from agriculture cannot get to zero. But we will have to work with farmers to reduce emissions and maximise sequestration, and we will have to configure future supports to deliver on those objectives. </p>  <p>  The target of a &ldquo;climate neutral economy&rdquo; by 2050 is a long-term ambition but will require us to start working now to meet it.

The bioeconomy refers to the development of value from biological resources with a particular focus on waste streams.</p>  <p>  The Government has invested significantly in this early development. This follows the development of a national policy statement and the establishment of a cross departmental group, co-chaired by my Department. Financial support for this developments includes through my Department's competitive research and Rural Development Programme funding, through the BiOrbic Bioeconomy Research Centre (through Science Foundation Ireland) and the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation (through Enterprise Ireland) building coalitions and public-private partnerships for co-investment with leading innovative companies, co-operatives and farmers.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of excellent examples of farmer and agri-business engagement with the Bioeconomy. These include: the development, through EU funding, of a biorefinery for dairy waste in Lisheen, Co. Tipperary; the development of a marine biorefinery in Co. Monaghan; and the development of Carbon-Neutral demonstration farm in Shinagh Farm, Co. Cork . My Department also supports a grass small-scale biorefinery demonstration project in Co. Cork under out EIP initiative, as part of our Rural Development Programme. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently announced the following further actions to further bioeconomy development:</p>  <p>  The allocation of 8 million euro reseach funding recently committed to support the generation of knowledge in the areas of agriculture, forestry and food and the bioeconomy.</p>  <p>  The imminent establishment of a bioeconomy forum to provide a voice for a broad range of stakeholders in the bioeconomy including the agri-food industry, primary producers, relevant state bodies and community groups and which will be set up shortly.</p>  <p>  The recent running of Bioeconomy Ireland Week 2020 to raise awareness of the bioeconomy and its products and to work with both public and private stakeholder to present ongoing research, innovation, demonstration, primary production, industrial, product and market activities that highlight how the bioeconomy is developing and being structured and mobilised in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, my Department and our partners across government are playing a leading role in the development of the bioeconomy and for the benefit of farmers, fishermen and agri-business.   </p></reply>

Moorepark is globally renowned for its research and development of sustainable grassbased systems of milk production, and associated dairy processing research. As well as research, Moorepark also plays a very important role in education and extension. In education, it has developed 2 very innovative courses with UCD comprising a Dairy Business degree  and a Diploma in Dairy Farm Management, where students spend a significant amount of time in Moorepark.</p>  <p>  On site Moorepark employs some 400 people including graduate students. On average Teagasc spend over &euro;20m annually on research at the Moorepark Campus. My Department is a significant funder contributing funding through yearly Grant in Aid allocations to Teagasc and through the Research Stimulus and FIRM funding programmes, which are both very important to Teagasc, Moorepark. There are currently 52 Active projects across all the programmes that involve Moorepark and a total award amount exceeds &euro;15m.</p>  <p>   In terms of Grant in Aid, my Department has provided Teagasc with an increased allocation next year of some &euro;7m bringing the overall allocation for the year to almost &euro;147m. It includes a &euro;42m allocation to support current expenditure across the education, advisory and research directorates. Prioritisation of funding for particular services/programmes is an operational matter for Teagasc to determine.</p>  <p>  Turning to Moorepark, Food Wise 2025 called for increased investment in Research, Development and Innovation, noting that low levels by the agri-food sector were inhibiting the transition towards higher value production and exports. Part of the response included a recommendation that Teagasc develop a &ldquo;Food Innovation Hub&rdquo; at its Moorepark campus to promote greater collaboration between industry and public research and deliver a step change in innovation activity in the food industry. My Department agreed to provide almost &euro;9m for the project from its capital allocation on a phased basis. Just over &euro;5m has been paid to date to meet the costs of the project with an additional &euro;2.5m allocated for the remainder of this year. On completion in early 2021, the 'Hub' will consist of 12 custom designed Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) units, equipped with dedicated offices, laboratories and temperature controlled storage space.</p>  <p>  It will create an environment where new concepts can be generated, new products manufactured, and test marketed for commercial potential. Greater industry investment in Research, Development and Innovation will be encouraged to develop new products and exploit growing market segments internationally particularly in the dairy sector. It will support innovation in the food industry thus enabling companies to become more competitive while also generating market focused research initiatives. SMEs will be provided with opportunities to engage in research activities in an affordable way, allowing smaller companies to scale up and engage in an expanded range of Research, Development and Innovation with renowned Teagasc food researchers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Food Hub, Teagasc has also carried out a &euro;10m upgrade of the Moorepark Technology Ltd pilot plant facility at the Moorepark campus. This meant refurbishment of existing infrastructure and building new processing capability. The newly upgraded facility offers a variety of services ranging from pilot plant rental and technical assistance through contract R&amp;D and pre-commercial manufacture. It allows dairy companies to fine tune new processes and products at a pilot scale before embarking on full-scale industrial production. This capacity to &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; scientific advances at pre-production scale is essential if investment in research is to result in commercial return.   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid, and to allow marts to continue to operate.  </p><p>I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p><p>On 19<sup>th</sup>October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21<sup>st</sup>. </p><p>The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of this Government is to protect lives and to protect public health, while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.</p><p>Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20<sup>th</sup>October, that all marts may conduct sales using online platforms only.  </p><p>The Government has responded to COVID-19 pandemic with a range of supports designed to mitigate the impact on the market.  Agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. A comprehensive list of these supports is available on the Gov.ie website.</p><p>Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently, the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are operating through these platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.</p><p>This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation, and we are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.</p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  The number of people logging in to online sales on a daily basis are many multiples of the numbers of people that typically physically attend mart sales. The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices. </p><p>Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales, the cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034  head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day same period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved.</p><p>These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts to keep operating in this difficult period.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines.</p></reply>

My Department has engaged with advisers and farm bodies to encourage farmers with outstanding approvals to either submit the payment claim or to inform the Department that they do now wish to proceed. If they do not proceed and we are aware this means we can recycle the committed budget for another applicant.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to Tranche 17 of TAMS II is that the tranche was extended due to Covid-19 resulting in a 21-week tranche. A total of 4,952 new applications were received. There were considered together with the applications rolled over from tranche 16. As with all tranches all applications received were ranked in accordance with the set ranking procedure. Details of the ranking and selection criteria are widely available including on my Department&rsquo;s website since TAMS II opened in 2015. The top ranked 70% of the applications received were approved to proceed.</p>  <p>  In relation to Tranche 18, 3,448 applications were received and together with the 1,116 eligible applications rolled over from Tranche 17 bringing the total number of applications for consideration to 4,564. These were once again ranked and the top 70% of applications were selected for approval.</p>  <p>  It is open to applicants to withdraw an unsuccessful application and submit a new one under a subsequent tranche bearing in mind the ranking criteria.</p>  <p>  Payments under TAMS have now reached &euro;250m with a further &euro;130m committed in approvals.

This is particularly important as we deal with the challenges presented by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Trade missions will continue to play a key role here.  Our traditional "in person" method of developing trade with  customers is not feasible currently.  To that end, my Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, is holding a  series of Virtual Trade Missions  on 9 and 10 November with customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. These interactive engagements will include Irish industry  and existing and potential customers overseas. There will also be a series of virtual meetings with key international customers from Germany, the UK, Japan, China, UAE and SE Asia.   </p>  <p>  The Government's  commitment to new market development is illustrated by its appointment of  Martin Heydon T.D., as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task. My Department has also placed four additional Agriculture Attaches in the Irish Embassy network in recent years, in Berlin, Tokyo and Mexico City in 2019, and in Seoul, South Korea, in 2020. In addition, my Department's International Trade activities are being reorganised and further developed to deal with the challenges of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.126.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300081#WRD01000"><p>The gamma interferon test (also referred to as the GIF test or IFN-gamma test) is a valuable tool for detecting TB infection in cattle. It has been widely used as a core part of the TB eradication programme in Ireland since 2015 following many years of it being researched and tested in specific problem herds. Like all such tools, it is important to use it in ways which maximise its utility. Each diagnostic test has strengths and weaknesses, and the way in which a test is used must take these into account. The key measures of a diagnostic test&rsquo;s accuracy are sensitivity and specificity.  As is the case with diagnostic tests for other diseases, none of the tests currently available for the diagnosis of bovine TB (bTB) allow a perfectly accurate determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle. </p>  <p>  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin skin test (SICCT), often referred to as the skin test, which is used in Ireland is universally regarded as the best screening test in a general population of animals. However, in a group of animals where TB infection is known to be present, the gamma interferon test is used because it can detect infected cattle at an earlier stage post-infection than the skin test. Therefore it can detect a higher proportion of infected cattle; in other words, it has higher sensitivity than the skin test. When used in parallel to the skin test, the gamma interferon blood test can help to resolve TB problems in a herd more quickly by identifying cattle at an early stage of infection before they can spread infection onwards.    </p>  <p>  The gamma interferon test is used as standard in herds which have experienced a significant TB breakdown (for example, five or more reactors, 5% of the herd, or where the investigating veterinary inspector deems it necessary on epidemiological grounds). In addition, the gamma interferon test is used as a quality control measure on SICTT reactors, providing additional confidence in the quality of the skin testing process. </p>  <p>  However, the gamma interferon test is not suitable for use as a general screening test, in the way the SICCT test is used, because it has lower specificity than the skin test. That means the proportion of truly non-infected cattle identified as negative is lower with the gamma interferon test than with the skin test. Using it in herds not thought to be TB-infected would lead to non-infected cattle testing false positive. </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations made by the TB Forum was for additional focussing on herds with chronic or recurrent TB problems. Based on this recommendation my officials are developing policies which will involve additional uses of the gamma interferon test; these will be discussed in more detail at the TB Forum as part of the ongoing discussions on TB strategy.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are two laboratories in Ireland carrying out gamma interferon TB testing for my Department; a tender for a third lab to provide additional testing capacity has recently closed and this is expected to support an increase in test capacity. </p></reply>

I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of this pandemic, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently the majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise. Buyers may still view animals in person by prior appointment with the relevant mart.</p>  <p>On Saturday, 24th October, one of the three main online systems used by marts had a problem that led to a delay in mart sales in 16 mart centres. The problem was resolved after approximately 2 hours and sales were able to resume.   26 of some 30 mart sales that took place across the country on that day completed their sales, while four marts were reported as having cancelled.  Officials of my Department are in contact with each of the system providers, and all reaffirmed their commitment to taking all necessary steps to try to avoid any reoccurrence of such problems.  According to the online platform, the issue was not related to broadband connection.</p>  <p>  My Department is closely monitoring the situation.  Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales, the cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034 head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved.</p>  <p>  These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts and service providers to keep operating in this difficult period.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines.</p></reply>

The bioeconomy refers to the development of value from biological resources with a particular focus on waste streams.</p>  <p>  The Government has invested significantly in this early development. This follows the development of a national policy statement and the establishment of a cross departmental group, co-chaired by my Department. Financial support for this developments includes through my Department's competitive research and Rural Development Programme funding, through the BiOrbic Bioeconomy Research Centre (through Science Foundation Ireland) and the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation (through Enterprise Ireland) building coalitions and public-private partnerships for co-investment with leading innovative companies, co-operatives and farmers.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of excellent examples of farmer and agri-business engagement with the Bioeconomy. These include: the development, through EU funding, of a biorefinery for dairy waste in Lisheen, Co. Tipperary; the development of a marine biorefinery in Co. Monaghan; and the development of Carbon-Neutral demonstration farm in Shinagh Farm, Co. Cork . My Department also supports a grass small-scale biorefinery demonstration project in Co. Cork under out EIP initiative, as part of our Rural Development Programme. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently announced the following further actions to further bioeconomy development:</p>  <p>  The allocation of 8 million euro reseach funding recently committed to a number of projects to support the generation of knowledge in the areas of agriculture, forestry and food and the bioeconomy.</p>  <p>  The imminent establishment of a bioeconomy forum to provide a voice for a broad range of stakeholders in the bioeconomy including the agri-food industry, primary producers, relevant state bodies and community groups and which will be set up shortly.</p>  <p>  The recent running of Bioeconomy Ireland Week 2020 to raise awareness of the bioeconomy and its products and to work with both public and private stakeholder to present ongoing research, innovation, demonstration, primary production, industrial, product and market activities that highlight how the bioeconomy is developing and being structured and mobilised in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, my Department and our partners across government are playing a leading role in the development of the bioeconomy and for the benefit of farmers, fishermen and agri-business.</p></reply>

There are approximately 46,124 sheep flock-keepers registered on my Department&rsquo;s database. The data from the 2019 census returns indicate that there were 3.8 million sheep in the State on 31 December 2019, representing an increase of 2% on the December 2018 figure of 3.73 million.</p>  <p>  Approximately 2.76 million sheep were slaughtered in 2019.  In terms of producing the wool for sale, in general, the farmer outsources the shearing of the sheep and sell the wool to agents. My Department officials oversee and inspect 50 approved and registered wool stores where the wool is held while awaiting sale.  </p>  <p>  Ireland produces excellent quality wool. The factors contributing to this quality include Irish genetic breeding standards, sheep welfare standards and the availability of quality Irish grass, water and nutritional supplementation on Irish Sheep farms. Irish sheep have a high animal health status being free from sheep exotic diseases including sheep pox that when present downgrades wool quality. In addition, Irish sheep farms adheres to high biosecurity and quality assurance standards. The animal husbandry on Irish sheep farms ensures that programmes are in place to control ectoparasites such as sheep scab that can downgrade wool quality where it is not controlled. All of these factors contribute to the excellent quality of Irish wool.</p>  <p>  In an industry such as the wool industry where prices tend to move in cycles and market forces and market demand dictate the  price,  it is imperative   that the players ensure and promote a  diversity of  options for the product in the market place. Wool is a sustainable natural resource and is used in fabrics, furniture, carpeting, bedding and indeed  can also be in gardening and makes an  excellent compost. There are  many other different and diverse  possible ways that wool can be utilised including wool pellet production which is an excellent organic fertiliser, sound proofing, insulation, packaging and as natural slug repellent. The current market uncertainties should provide an impetus for the industry players to come together to see what business opportunities are out there and try to promote the excellent product in as many markets as possible. </p>  <p>  You will be aware that  one of our  actions under the  Programme for Government is to undertake a review of the potential demand in domestic and international markets for wool based products such as insulation and fertilisers.  A sum of &euro;100,000 has been allocated to this project and I am currently examining how best to conduct this review. My Department will organize a consultation process with Industry in relation to the Terms of Reference of the review over the coming months. </p></reply>

This is particularly important as we deal with the challenges presented by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Trade missions will continue to play a key role here.  Our traditional "in person" method of developing trade with  customers is not feasible currently.  To that end, my Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, is holding a  series of Virtual Trade Missions  on 9 and 10 November with customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. These interactive engagements will include Irish industry  and existing and potential customers overseas. There will also be a series of virtual meetings with key international customers from Germany, the UK, Japan, China, UAE and SE Asia.   </p>  <p>  The Government's  commitment to new market development is illustrated by its appointment of  Martin Heydon T.D., as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task. My Department has also placed four additional Agriculture Attaches in the Irish Embassy network in recent years, in Berlin, Tokyo and Mexico City in 2019, and in Seoul, South Korea, in 2020. In addition, my Department's International Trade activities are being reorganised and further developed to deal with the challenges of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.150.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300081#WRD02600"><p>Since the beginning of the Covid19 crisis, my Department has worked intensively, in cooperation with marts representative organisations, to ensure that marts may remain in operation.  I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of this pandemic, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p><p>My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid19, and to allow marts to continue to operate. </p><p>From April to June 8<sup>th</sup>, marts operated without public attendance at sales rings, with marts able to operate transactions online or facilitate the brokering of sales, including the weighing and viewing of stock and the safe processing of financial transactions for buyers and sellers. From June, as other public health restrictions lifted, public attendance at sales rings was again permitted in marts subject to strict compliance with Covid19-specific standard operating procedures in each mart, based on the HSE Covid19 rules.  </p><p>On 19<sup>th</sup>October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with Covid19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21<sup>st</sup>.</p><p>Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20<sup>th</sup>October, that sales rings must close and that all marts may conduct sales by brokering transactions or by using online platforms  only.  </p><p>From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  </p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  The number of people logging in to onlien mart sales on a daily basis are many multiples of the number of people that typically attend a mart in person. The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p><p>Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales, the cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034  head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved. Buyers may still view animals in person by prior appointment with the relevant mart.</p><p>These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts to keep operating in this difficult period.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. </p></reply>

An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210 m of which will be allocated as required to the HSE and &euro;30 m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the provision of treatment in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists. This funding means that those patients who require urgent and time critical care are seen as a matter of priority, while at the same time providing the much-needed capacity to provide routine care for patients on waiting lists. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the HSE on the development of the National Service Plan, which will set out further details of how the &euro;210 million allocation for the fund will be utilised. It is envisaged that some of this funding will be used to procure additional capacity in private hospitals. It is also envisaged that it can be used for Public hospitals. This will help to make up for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on capacity in the public sector. The impact of this funding will be monitored by my Department.  </p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to improving waiting times can be further seen through the allocation of the additional &euro;30 million Access to Care funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This brings the total NTPF budget for 2021 to &euro;130 million, which will be used to source appointments and treatment for long-waiting patients, and will also be used to support access to diagnostic scans and fund additional HSE beds. </p></reply>

Amongst the key objectives of the plan are an improvement in patient experience times in Emergency Department settings and a reduction of 30% on the previous year&rsquo;s trolley count.</p>  <p>  Extended opening hours for Primary Care Centres were not viewed as being critical in reducing demand on Emergency Departments.  This reflects the fact that although the centres are important in supporting the delivery of primary care therapy and other services in the community, they are not intended to serve as minor injury units or as an alternative to ED admission.  </p>  <p>  However, there are several initiatives being advanced in the Primary Care sector through the Winter Plan and Budget which will support hospital avoidance. This investment includes a total of &euro;180m to develop new pathways of care for primary health services and a further &euro;25m for structured GP access to diagnostics.   This unprecedented funding for primary care reform will enable the recruitment of over 2,000 staff, with a particular focus on nursing and community therapists, and will allow capacity deficits in the sector to be addressed through the rollout of such initiatives as Community Healthcare Networks, community specialist teams for older people and for chronic disease management, and the nationwide expansion of Community Intervention Teams.  </p>  <p>  The additional investment secured in Budget 2021 will not only bolster our response to COVID-19 but will help to strategically develop capacity across the health system in line with Sl&aacute;intecare to improve access to care and address the challenges identified by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Public health guidance was specifically developed to underpin the safe resumption of services, and this guidance was published in July.  </p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location.

However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. </p>  <p>  The government will be investing an additional &euro;100 million in new initiatives in 2021, bringing the total disabilities budget to around &euro;2.2 billion. Regarding day services specifically, this additional investment will build the capacity of our adult disability services nationally, including services in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, and will increase day services by one day a week, for those whose services were reduced due to COVID-19.

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.  The new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recommits to this Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation, stating &ldquo;Enhanced governance and accountability in the health service is a key component of Sl&aacute;intecare reform. The HSE Board is now in place and we must now bring forward detailed proposals on the six new regional health areas to deliver services for patients locally that are safe, high quality and fairly distributed.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  When the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last year, Kerry and Cork were incorporated as Area D. As agreed at that time, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas was expected to be brought to Government for its approval in 2020. The intention was that this plan would set out the high-level organisational design for the health system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct. Work was underway in the Department of Health and the HSE to develop these detailed proposals, in consultation with stakeholders. Understandably, this work was paused as a result of COVID-19. This programme of work will be given further consideration to take account of the Programme for Government commitment and any new considerations relating to COVID-19.</p></reply>

The specific measures to be introduced in the package for family carers will be determined in the context of the HSE's National Service Planning Process for 2021.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also provided for an increase of &euro;150 in the Carer's Support Grant paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to people providing care for an older person or someone with a disability.  This will increase the rate to &euro;1,850, with effect from June next year. </p>  <p>  In the absence of regular, scheduled day services and respite supports, the HSE and service providers have tried to maintain services that can be delivered safely during the pandemic. They are providing outreach and telecare solutions, using technology where possible, and have developed creative and innovative models of care to support service users. The HSE has adapted its community services to provide a flexible response that continues to meet the needs of service users during COVID-19, while also providing information on its website and signposting family carers to organisations, such as Family Carers Ireland, for additional community supports.</p>  <p>  Disability services remain open during the current level 5 restrictions. During the pandemic, a number of disability respite centres continued to operate, albeit at a reduced capacity, while others were temporarily re-purposed as isolation facilities. Currently, disability respite services are in the second phase of a three-phase plan for re-opening. Day care and respite services for older people remain closed due to the need to protect people from infection risk; these will resume once adequate infection prevention and control measures and physical distancing are in place. </p>  <p>  The review and update of the cross-departmental National Carers' Strategy, which will be led by my Department, will provide an opportunity to examine how best we can continue to support and meet the needs of family carers.  </p></reply>

The additional investment will increase the total disabilities budget for 2021 to around 2.2 billion, of which &euro;100 million will fund new initiatives targeted at five key areas: children&rsquo;s services, day services, community supports, residential services, and integration.The HSE's National Service Planning process will determine how these key priorities can be progressed in 2021, within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the majority of specialist disability services in this country are provided by voluntary organisations funded by the HSE under Section 38 and Section 39 of the Health Act 2004. Service Level Agreements are set out between the HSE and the individual organisations, which are agreed between the HSE and the service provider at the start of each year.  The specific allocations to HSE funded specialist disability services in 2021 will be determined in the context of the National Service Planning process.  Following on from this process, the 2021 budgets for service providers will be a matter for the HSE to agree with individual providers under the relevant service arrangements.  </p><p>In addition to the investment outlined in Budget 2021, the Strengthening Disability Services Scheme, which Minister Rabbitte and I announced last week, will make &euro;20 million available on a once off basis in the current year to support voluntary disability service providers engaged in the Transforming Lives Reform programme. Details of this programme and information on how service providers can apply are available at .</p></reply>

The campaign received great interest from the public. The high number of applicants is a further testament to the community spirit and willingness to help in any way possible by members of the public to the ongoing response to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive received 3,451 applications to the role of community swabber. To date, 1,661 people have been successful at interview, with interviews still ongoing. Thus far, 191 people have been appointed to positions.  A further 69 people are due to start this week. Groups of successful applicants are being deployed each week.  The campaign aims to appoint approximately 800 community swabbers.</p>  <p>  In order to respond to the pandemic, it was necessary to utilise existing staff through redeployment, especially in the area of testing and tracing. By mid-September, I am pleased to say that 55% of redeployed staff from Community Healthcare Organisations had already returned to their posts. My Department and I await up to date numbers of those redeployed and those that have returned to their posts. With the high level of recruitment into the testing and tracing services, more redeployed staff will be able to return to their posts in the coming weeks. COVID-19 has had profound impacts on the health services, and both services and staff had to adapt. As we continue to resume services, my Department and I continue to work with the Health Service Executive to ensure they have the resources to ensure a safe and reliable health service.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase critical care and general acute bed capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet demand. </p>  <p>  Significant work has been underway in 2020 to increase capacity as far as is possible. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional general acute beds until the 31st December 2020 at an estimated cost of &euro;24 million for the year. The HSE confirmed 197 of those beds have opened as planned. In addition, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity.</p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. As such, 251 additional acute beds and 89 sub-acute beds are due to open in quarter 4 of 2020.</p>  <p>  Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds.  </p>  <p>  In relation to critical care, at the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020.</p></reply>

These include permanent, temporary, full-time and part-time contracts. Both the needs of the service and the wishes of the employee are considered when determining the type of contract. Some nurses will wish to accept and keep a temporary contract, depending on their current circumstances. The change from a temporary contract to a permanent contract is not an automatic one. </p>  <p>  When applying for a role advertised, it will be noted the type of contract that is on offer. If an employee reaches the end of their temporary contract, they are welcomed to discuss moving to a permanent contract with their human resources team, and this will be considered on a case by case basis, given the needs of the service.</p>  <p>  With regards to nurses hired in response to COVID-19, many of these roles are by their very nature temporary. In Budget 2021, I announced the provision of funding for an increase of approximately 15,738 whole-time equivalents, which provides for the retention of posts permanently in 2021. This will allow nurses and all other healthcare professionals currently retained on temporary contracts to apply for permanent positions, if they wish.</p></reply>

This plan includes the normal winter plan that would incorporate enhancement to services to cope with winter pressures, but also takes a more strategic approach by considering actions necessary to resume services and building capacity such that the system can deal with expected demand and pressures to the end of 2020/21. </p><p>This Plan was considered as part of the Estimates process, which concluded with the announcement of over &euro;4billion additional funding for the Health Service in 2021. The HSE will now produce its National Service Plan which will set out the level the type and volume of services that it will provide for the funding allocated.</p><p>The Government introduced Level 5 public health restrictive measures to enable a significant suppression of the virus to very low levels of transmission in advance of the winter months. These measures have been introduced to limit the impact on public health while protecting the three core priorities of: </p><p>1. Preventing unnecessary disruption to non-COVID health and social care services particularly given the impact on those services in the first half of 2020</p><p>2. Protecting medically and socially vulnerable people and</p><p>3.

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015. </p><p>The focus of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is on achieving best outcomes for people, by providing safe, high quality, person-centred care at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary. The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework. It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step. The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services.</p><p>The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey.</p><p>The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:</p><p>- Acute hospital;</p><p>- Complex specialist rehabilitation services;  </p><p>- Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Community based specialist rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Primary care; and </p><p>- Voluntary organisations.</p><p>This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs. It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services. It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation </p><p>The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021. However, it is recognised that continued investment in and development of neuro-rehabilitation services will need to be prioritised beyond the three-year implementation period of this Implementation Framework.</p><p>As the issue raised is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE)  to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE uses rapid tests in key clinical settings, such as in our hospitals for emergency and surgical care.  These are rapid PCR tests which give results in short timeframes, for example less than an hour. As part of the HSE&rsquo;s testing and tracing plan, it is trying to increase the number of these available as there is significant international demand and supply challenges. These tests only work in very small numbers so are not appropriate for large scale community testing.</p>  <p>  Many of the rapid non-PCR Covid tests reported in the media, which purport to offer a test result in minutes (for example antigen tests) lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare.  However, this issue continues to be monitored by WHO, ECDC, HIQA, and the HSE Laboratory taskforce.</p>  <p>  The HSE believes that antigen and other types of testing, such as saliva testing, may well have a role in testing of asymptomatic people. It is constantly monitoring the sensitivity of these tests to ensure that where deployed they will be of appropriate quality and sensitivity. Again, this will not replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p></reply>

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement, the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement, which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. </p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. The process is due to be completed soon, and a panel put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. In the meantime, the Department has approved a temporary HSE arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals pending the finalisation of the national procurement process. </p>  <p>  The negotiations in the event of a surge are ongoing.</p>  <p>  The cost of beds covered by the agreement between the HSE and each private provider is determined under the terms of the procurement process.</p></reply>

Against that backdrop, the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group submitted a draft action plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at the hospital.  That plan takes account of the need to develop services at Portlaoise in the context of developing a model of service provision to span the Hospital Group. </p>  <p>  While no decision has yet been taken on the draft action plan, it is important that in any consideration of services at the hospital, patient safety and patient outcomes are the priority.

It sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outlines the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.</p>  <p>  The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p>  <p>  Over the past number of months my Department and the HSE have collaborated to increase capacity and readiness across the health service in response to the pandemic. This encompasses developments across all areas of the health service, including with regard to public health teams, contact tracing and acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  The HSE now has standing capacity to test 120,000 people every week. As part of its ongoing process improvement, the HSE is currently running a nationwide recruitment campaign for swabbers and contact tracers, setting up temporary swabbing sites and making process improvements to the end-to-end test and trace system. Recruitment is a key focus. 500 additional contact tracers are being hired to provide standing capacity for contact tracing with 280 already in place and a further 60 - 70 being appointed on a weekly basis. A further 180 people have been appointed to date to carry out swabbing activities, whilst additional candidates are currently going through the compliance and interview process.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to identify the products and funding level required to meet the clinical demand for PPE for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. My Department and the HSE are continuing to engage on future requirements to ensure adequate stocks of all required materials are sourced and maintained in line with forecast demand.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also currently involved in an EU Procurement Exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat Covid-19. Both my Department and the HSE have actively engaged in meetings of the Steering Board that is chaired by the Commission which provides the core governance and consultative forum for the EU procurement process.</p>  <p>  The arrangements are intended to ensure a coordinated action at the European level to vaccinate the EU population. Ireland has already opted into two Advance Purchase Agreements (APA), (1) with the British-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University and (2) with Janssen, a Belgian Pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a COVID-19 Immunisation Strategy Group has also been established. The purpose of the Group is to advise on and assist in the development of national policy relating to COVID-19 vaccines. </p>  <p>  At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p>  <p>   Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.</p>  <p>  Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the WHO. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 found that the net requirement in combination with health system reform is for an additional 2,590 hospital beds by 2031 (2,100 inpatient, 300 day case and 190 critical care). The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. My Department is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. </p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that further details in relation to the delivery of health and social care services in the context of Covid-19 can be found in Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.</p></reply>

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).  Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p><p>Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  The initial funding provided to commence Phase One in 2020 is being utilised specifically on the development of the first four of these Hubs, notwithstanding that the work had to be slowed due to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic within the health service.  As I confirmed in public statements on the Budget, additional funding is being made available in 2021 to set up the final two Regional Fertility Hubs and facilitate the continuation and completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care. </p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation is commenced.  Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. </p><p>Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement  which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. </p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. The process is due to be completed soon, and a panel finalised, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. In the meantime, my Department has approved a temporary HSE arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals pending the finalisation of the national procurement process.</p>  <p>  The negotiations in the event of a surge are ongoing. </p></reply>

As our population, particularly our older population continues to grow, key projections from the analysis indicated that for the period 2016-2021 there would be a</p>  <p>  - 12% growth in overall population;</p>  <p>  - 59% growth in 65+ population; and</p>  <p>  - 95% growth in 85+ population.</p>  <p>  The review noted that if key reforms and productivity measures are implemented, a 120% increase in home supports will be required by 2031.</p>  <p>  In 2018 the HSE began streamlining services by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach has provided significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p>  <p>  Overall, the 2018 HSE National Service Plan (NSP) provided for 17.4 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time.  This includes home support hours provided through intensive home care packages. In 2019 the target increased to 18.26 million hours and this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for over 19.26 million hours of home support.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;150 million is being provided for home support in 2021.  A new National Home Support Office will be established along with commencing the roll out of InterRAI, a comprehensive standard care assessment tool.  The very significant additional funding will provide a further 5 million hours over this year&rsquo; target aimed at keeping older people healthy and happy, in their community, for as long as possible.  This represents about a 40% increase in home support hours over the 2018 NSP target. </p>  <p>  A high-quality, consistent home-support service, focused on keeping people well in their homes and communities for as long as possible, is a key enabler to ensuring that people across a continuum of care get the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report (2017).   </p>  <p>  While work undertaken in 2019 focussed on the design of the scheme, work in 2020 is focussing on the development of a framework for the regulation of home-support services. In addition, the options for the funding of the new scheme are being examined through work with the Economic and Social Research Institute on the projected demand for, and cost of, home-support services in various scenarios. This work will ensure that the funding model developed for the statutory scheme is fit for purpose.</p></reply>

As set out in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s options appraisal, the preferred option for development of a second Cath laboratory at UHW is for a lab and associated 12 bed day ward (delivering six additional beds) on the roof of the existing Cardiology Department, which will operate five days per week and provide diagnostic services only. </p><p>The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the Capital Plan for the provision of a second Cath lab at UHW and planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January 2020.  The Disability Access certificate was granted on 23<sup>rd</sup>April 2020. The Fire certificate was granted on 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020.  Preparation of contract documentation commenced, and contractor selection is complete subject to a cooling off period.  The project went to tender on the 30<sup>th</sup>September. </p><p>The Procurement process is as per the Government / OGP Construction Procurement Guidelines.  The Tender process being used is a 2 Stage process, whereby Main Contractors are first Tendered (using Indicated, Estimated Figures for Specialist Works). The Specialist Works (Mainly Mechanical &amp;amp; Electrical) are then Tendered separately and the successful Specialists are Novated to the selected Main Contractor at their Tendered figures. This 2 stage process is used where the Specialist Works form a large part of the Construction Cost or where particularly difficult Specialist Works are envisaged.?</p><p>The HSE require their design team to conclude a comprehensive tender review and assessment process to ensure the tenders received represent value for money and that tender returns are in line with HSE requirements. There is a period of time required prior to issue of the Letter of Intent (LoI) to clarify contract award queries.  There is also a mandatory 2-week cooling off period post Letter of Intent (LoI) being issued to unsuccessful contractors prior to awarding the contract.?</p><p>Because of the time taken to run these Tender competitions in Series and the time for Tender clarifications and Assessment, at each stage, the process normally takes about 4 months to complete and is expected to be completed at end of Q4 2020. </p><p>The works to the new Cath laboratory are due to commence in Q1 of 2021 with a proposed 12-month build.</p></reply>

Public health guidance was specifically developed to underpin the safe resumption of services, and this guidance was published in July. </p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened they re-opened at approximately 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. </p>  <p>  The government will be investing an additional &euro;100 million in new initiatives in 2021, bringing the total disabilities budget to around &euro;2.2 billion. Regarding day services specifically, this additional investment will build the capacity of our adult disability services nationally, and will increase day services by one day a week, for those whose services were reduced due to COVID-19.  It will also support around 1,700 young people who leave school and training programmes in 2021. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to the &euro;7.5 million being made available to support the resumption of day services which I announced in September. </p>  <p>  The HSE gathered data at the end of September on the quantum of services currently being provided to individuals, and this will act as a baseline to track additional service levels.</p></reply>

As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The <i>Report of the Chief Medical Officer to the Minister for Health on the Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures </i>was published in November 2018. Subsequently, the HSE published an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations in April 2019.  An ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through the HSE, led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP). </p><p>In terms of broader service provision going forward, the HSE&rsquo;s proposals include the development of multidisciplinary specialist services for women suffering from mesh complications at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. Funding of &euro;500,000 has recently been allocated to CUMH to establish the mesh specialist centre. In addition, the NWIHP is continuing to work with the NMH regarding their submission for the establishment of the parallel centre there. In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  </p><p>All women affected by mesh have been strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. Information on this is available on the HSE website. </p><p>There are no plans at present to hold an independent inquiry into the use of valproate medicines in Ireland. However, the Minister is scheduled to meet with patient representative groups later this month to discuss this and other issues relating to sodium valproate.</p></reply>

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.</p><p>Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement  which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. </p><p>In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. The process is due to be completed soon, and a panel put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. </p><p>In the meantime, the Department has approved a temporary HSE arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals pending the finalisation of the national procurement process. The negotiations in the event of a surge are ongoing.</p><p>In relation to the engagements I have had with the Private Hospitals Association since I became Minister, the information requested by the Deputy is provided in the attached table, which details contacts between the Department of Health and the Private Hospitals Association from 29th June 2020 to 23rd October 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Time</th>       <th>Name of DoH Staff in Contact with PHA</th>       <th>Contact Type</th>       <th>Name of PHA Contact</th>       <th>Broad description of meeting/email/call</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>06/07/2020</td>       <td>19:24</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Letter requesting meeting </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>08/07/2020</td>       <td>15:08</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email obo Matthew O'Gorman (Private Secretary to Minister Donnelly)</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Acknowledgment</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10/09/2020</td>       <td>16:53</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Request for meeting in respect of winter planning and other potential assistance</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11/09/2020</td>       <td>18:35</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Acknowledgment</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>06/10/2020</td>       <td>09:02</td>       <td>Susan Mitchell (Advisor to Min Donnelly)</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey</td>       <td>Fowarded meeting request</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>07/10/2020</td>       <td>13:40</td>       <td>Miriam Rooney (Private Secretary to Minister Donnelly)</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Forwarded meeting request</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16/10/2020</td>       <td>16:52</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email obo Miriam Rooney</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey obo John Hurley</td>       <td>Acceptance of meeting request</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20/10/2020</td>       <td>In the am</td>       <td>Denise Kelly (Minister's Diary)</td>       <td>Phone Call</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey</td>       <td>Confirming list of attendees/ details for upcoming meeting</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20/10/2020</td>       <td>15:12</td>       <td>Minister's Diary email</td>       <td>Email</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey</td>       <td>Provided list of attendees</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21/10/2020</td>       <td>15:00 - 16:00</td>       <td>Minister Donnelly, Greg Dempsey (Deputy Secretary General), David R Smith (Director)</td>       <td>Meeting</td>       <td>Iarla Mongey, John Hurley, Bill Maher, James O'Donoghue, Nadia Putoshilova </td>       <td>Winter Initiative, Level 5 (Video Conference)</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The additional funding of &euro;50m provided for new medicines in Budget 2021 will allow the HSE to provide access to medicines which have been recommended by the HSE Drugs Group, on the basis of efficacy and value for money in line with the 2013 Health Act, and ultimately provide more medicines to Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it received an application in December 2018 for the reimbursement of patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.</p>  <p>  In January 2019, a full HTA was commissioned by the HSE. This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The HTA report with respect to patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.  The HSE Drugs Group have requested patient and clinician engagement input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE EMT regarding reimbursement of patisiran (Onpattro&reg;). This medicine is currently under review with the RDTRC.</p>  <p>  The application for patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the HSE that it has received an application in August 2019 for the reimbursement of inotersen (Tegsedi&reg;) for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR).</p>  <p>  On 26 August 2019, the HSE commissioned a rapid review with respect to this indication. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on 7 October 2019 that a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was required for this medicine to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of inotersen compared with the current standard of care.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 9 October 2019 as per agreed processes. To date, the applicant has not submitted a HTA dossier to the NCPE for assessment. A completed HTA is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.</p></reply>

The advice of NPHET is usually provided in the form of a letter to the Minister for Health from the Chief Medical Officer, in his role as the Chair of NPHET. This advice is subsequently published on the Government website. It has set out a consistent set of advices and recommendations that are available for inspection by all.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputies question, the Government has always been clear that a &ldquo;zero covid&rdquo; option is not one that is available to Ireland due to a number of factors, most pertinently the border with Northern Ireland and the Common Travel Area. Our proximity to Europe and the nature of the supply chains we are part of, both as an exporter and importer of vital goods, are also relevant in any considerations here. </p>  <p>  The clear advice from NPHET has been and continues to be that our overarching objective must be to suppress the virus to the lowest level possible and to maintain it at a low level.

These measures have been introduced to limit the impact on public health while protecting the three core priorities of: </p><p>1. Preventing unnecessary  disruption to non-COVID health and social care services particularly given the impact on those services in the first half of 2020</p><p>2.

In the coming months, my Department will undertake work to determine the best approach to the Strategy update, including through liaison with other Government Departments to identify actions that can be included in an updated Strategy. As an initial step in engaging with key stakeholders in relation to this process, my colleague Mary Butler T.D., Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, recently held a roundtable meeting to hear directly from family carers about their experience of caring, in particular, since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Family carers provide selfless and dedicated care to their loved ones, and the Government recognises that the caring role can be challenging, particularly in the current circumstances. My Department secured &euro;2 million in Budget 2021 for the National Carers' Strategy, which will be used to provide a more a standard package of supports to family carers in every region to enable them to continue caring with confidence.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. </p><p>Prevention and suppression of the disease in the community is the critical first step to protecting vulnerable groups but specific measures also need to be in place. Keeping the number of cases of COVID-19 as low as possible in the community provides the greatest protection to those who are most vulnerable from the severest impacts of this disease. This is continues to be crucial at the present time given that we remain without effective drug therapies or vaccines with which to respond to COVID-19. As such, preventing people becoming infected is still the most effective tool available to deal with COVID-19.</p><p>The Government has already identified the high-risk conditions and places where COVID-19 spreads most easily as well as the groups of people who are most likely to be affected and are most vulnerable to the disease. We continue to ensure implementation of the existing measures and will advance additional measures to prevent spread in these high-risk areas. </p><p>We are aware that older people, particularly those who are medically compromised or frailer are at severe risk for poorer outcomes from COVID-19, and that congregated settings such as long-term residential care facilities have been severely impacted.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended the establishment of an Expert Panel on Nursing Homes to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Report of the COVID-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel includes 86 recommendations in total, over 15 thematic areas, with associated timelines for implementation over the short, medium and long term.  </p><p>I have established an oversight structure to ensure the implementation of the important recommendations contained in this Report. This encompasses the establishment of both an Implementation Oversight Team and a Reference Group. I can advise the Deputy that there is a key focus on the implementation of recommendations that require immediate action to ensure ongoing preparedness as we move into the winter months. </p><p>One of the key recommendations of the Expert Panel is the continuation of the range of enhanced supports to nursing homes including:</p><p>- Provision of staff accommodation </p><p>- Support to nursing homes through 23 HSE COVID-19 Response Teams</p><p>- Provision of PPE free of charge to nursing homes</p><p>- Provision of a suite of guidance and expert support, including clinical and infection prevention and control expertise</p><p>In line with the recommendations (1.1 and 1.2) of the Expert Panel, these enhanced supports, which were recommended by NPHET at the end of March, continue to be implemented and will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Prevention and management of outbreaks in vulnerable populations and high-risk settings is an ongoing priority. Outbreak management in these settings is a priority for public health and is overseen by the National Outbreak Control Team who provide regular reports to NPHET.</p><p>Serial testing of nursing home staff, and certain high-risk settings and groups such as meat factories is in place to protect the vulnerable and ensure early identification and interruption of transmission in such high risk settings.</p><p>Using their experience to date of the virus, relevant Departments (e.g. the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as my own Department) in collaboration with the relevant agencies continue to update plans to protect the most vulnerable so as to align with the escalation framework set out in <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-1</i>9. </p><p>The aim is to ensure specific measures are targeted to people living within particularly vulnerable communities, for example among the Homeless, and in Traveller and Roma communities. These measure include making available adequate public health supports to reduce risk, protect vulnerable residents and make accommodation available for those who may be required to self-isolate and lack appropriate facilities to do so.  Local authorities are also continuing to work with the HSE to ensure the safety of households accessing emergency accommodation. </p><p>Extensive guidance for medically vulnerable and other vulnerable groups has been produced by the HPSC and can be found at <i></i>.</p></reply>

The Plan was developed in cooperation with stakeholders from across the public service and, in particular, with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>An Implementation Group on Policing Reform &ndash; with a former member of CoFPI as its independent Chair &ndash; has been established and has collective responsibility for the delivery of the Plan. </p><p>To help guide the work of the Implementation Group on Policing Reform and act as a clearing house where particular blockages are being experienced, a High Level Steering Board on Policing Reform &ndash; chaired by the Secretary General to the Government &ndash; has also been established. </p><p>The Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office &ndash; which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; monitors progress on the Plan, supports the work of the Implementation Group on Policing Reform, and keeps the High Level Steering Board on Policing Reform and Government apprised of the progress being made. </p><p>The Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality provides requisite political oversight of implementation of the Plan. </p><p><i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>is a living document which is reviewed and updated, as required, to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments, timeframes and milestones.</p><p><i>A Policing Service for our Future </i>is broken down in to four stages of implementation, namely:</p><p>1. The <i>Building Blocks Phase</i>(6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>2. The <i>Launching Phase</i>(6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>3. The <i>Scaling Phase </i>(18 months&rsquo; duration); and</p><p>4. The <i>Consolidation Phase </i>(12 &ndash; 18 months&rsquo; duration currently envisaged).</p><p>The <i>Building Blocks </i>and <i>Launching </i>Phases have been completed and some of the highlights in terms of achievements include:</p><p>-  The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide, has commenced;</p><p>-  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;</p><p>-  The National Security Analysis Centre (NSAC) has been established and the Director of NSAC appointed; and</p><p>-  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted which gives Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There has also been progress on legislative reform, in particular, legislation is being drafted relating to:</p><p>-  the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras);</p><p>-  the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention; and</p><p>-  a new coherent framework for the governance and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Progress in 2020 has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I have been encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation. The Implementation Group on Policing Reform has been actively engaged with key stakeholders to ensure continued momentum on reform, in so far as possible, under the current circumstances.</p><p>The third phase of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>&ndash; the <i>Scaling Phase</i>&ndash; has now commenced. This is the critical phase of the programme of reform, during which the programme gains momentum. The delivery of the majority of the actions will be started or executed during the<i>Scaling Phase.</i></p><p>Further information on progress and updates on the implementation of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>can be found at .</p></reply>

No. 448 of 2020 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 clearly sets out the temporary restrictions under Level 5 of the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID.  A list of essential services can be found at  and the list of essential retail outlets at Level 5 can be found at  </p><p>Level 5 restricts people from physically going into non-essential stores in order to stop people congregating and browsing for non-essential goods, to limit the spread of the virus. All retailers &ndash; essential and non-essential &ndash; can however continue to trade via &lsquo;remote ordering&rsquo; and fulfil orders for all products including non-essential items, by online or by phone, for home delivery and for collection.</p><p>Mixed retailers have been asked to separate their stock and only sell the items that are essential.  This is to encourage all of us to stay at home and shop local and to ensure fairness to those non-essential retailers who have had to close. </p><p>I and my colleague Minister of State English met with the Retail Forum members on 21 October to remind those in the retail sector, of the need for strict adherence to the public health guidelines during Level 5.  Minister English met again with the Retail Forum and major multiple grocery retailers on 28 October to reinforce this message and will convene a further meeting on 4 November. </p><p>I would like to thank retailers and their customers for their efforts at this difficult time. By each of us following the spirit of these new rules and working together we can hopefully return to a lower level of the Living with Covid-19 framework. </p></reply>

That is why I wrote to the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) in July this year, requesting it to consider the issue of rescue for small businesses. </p>  <p>  The CLRG is a statutory advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on matters pertaining to company law.  Its membership is broad and representative of key stakeholders in the area such as ISME, IBEC, ICTU, the Revenue Commissioners, insolvency and legal practitioners and regulators, making it uniquely well positioned to provide an informed view on the matter.</p>  <p>  I requested that the CLRG conduct its review in the context of reducing the costs and administrative burden associated with rescue so as to make it more accessible to SMEs under the following terms of reference:</p>  <p>1.  Examine and make recommendation as to how the statutory scheme of arrangement provisions of the Companies Act 2014 might be adapted to provide a rescue framework for SMEs.</p>  <p>2.  Examine and make recommendation as to ways in which key elements of the examinership process, including a stay on enforcement proceedings and a cross-class cram-down, might be incorporated into a rescue framework for SMEs.</p>  <p>3.  Other EU Member States provide for voluntary restructuring processes, with a strong emphasis on creditor agreement. Examine and make recommendation as to whether such a process is desirable in an Irish context with particular emphasis on the French framework (mandate ad hoc procedure).</p>  <p>4.  Any other recommendations the CLRG consider appropriate.</p>  <p>  The CLRG&rsquo;s Report has just been received in my Department and its recommendations will require careful consideration. This is a complex area of law. There is a delicate balance between sometimes competing stakeholders and it is important not to create a situation whereby we provide a framework for the rescue of one company at the expense of the viability of another. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to exploring ways in which we can support SMEs while also ensuring the appropriate safeguards remain in place for creditors and employees. </p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the difficulties the sector has faced in recent months due to public health restrictions.</p><p>The Government's COVID-19 plan published in September, 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19' specifically recognises the impact of restrictions on weddings as a category of organised events. I am pleased that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed guidelines that can be used for the organisation of wedding functions and are available on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Support Hub at: www.failteireland.ie  </p><p>My Department and its agencies have been focussed on coming up with solutions to help businesses overcome the challenges presented by the unprecedented difficulties caused by COVID-19. Details of the wide range of supports available are noted on my Department&rsquo;s website at . </p><p>In the wider context of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, the operation and reopening of Ireland's economy and society will be guided by the need to manage risk and repair the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society, and on the implementation of appropriate measures to do so across business and society as the situation evolves.</p><p>Budget 2021 provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus Package, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Restart Grant Plus, cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. </p><p>The New Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), is now operational through Revenue and offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>As a result of the fact that businesses have to close, we are making changes to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.</p><p>The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 31<sup>st</sup>August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7<sup>th</sup>September. We are giving companies extra assistance through an enhanced Restart Plus grant of up to &euro;25,000.</p><p>These measures are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives. My colleague, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, may be able to provide more specific details on a roadmap to recovery for the events and hospitality industry, for which she has lead responsibility.</p></reply>

In March, the Registrar announced that all annual returns, where the deadline for filing fell between 18th March 2020 and 30th June 2020 (both dates inclusive), would be treated as received on time if all elements were submitted by 30th June 2020. In May, this arrangement was further extended until 31st October 2020.  At that time, the Registrar indicated her reluctance to providing any further extension later in the year, being mindful of the need to balance the public interest in having up to date company information available against the difficulties caused by Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  The Registrar did commit to keeping the situation under review and on 12th October announced a decision that any company with an Annual Return Date of between 30th September 2020 and 31st December 2020 (both dates inclusive) will be deemed to have filed on time if all elements of the annual return are completed and filed by 26th February 2021. </p>  <p>  For those companies with an Annual Return Date prior to 30th September, the Registrar has announced that the Form B1 must be filed online by 31st October and the remaining elements of the annual return will be accepted if delivered by the date indicated on the signature page.</p>  <p>  In a further response to the challenges being experienced by companies due to the Covid-19 situation, the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 21st August 2020.  Section 6 of that Act provides that a company may opt to hold its Annual General Meeting on a date that is not later than 31st December 2020. Companies that need to avail of this provision can file annual returns up to 26th February 2021.  The CRO has advised that this should only be a necessity on an exceptional basis, where company rules require the financial statements to be laid before an AGM prior to filing an annual return, and such companies should get in touch with the CRO. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the revised deadlines, entities are encouraged to file as normal if in a position to do so. I understand that significant numbers of companies have managed to file their annual returns and have not needed to avail of the full extended filing period.  The CRO has indicated that, as of 28th October, over 71% of companies who are due to file by end October have already completed their filing while a further 22% of companies have partly filed.  </p></reply>

Under EE rules, country of origin rules are generally only introduced for foodstuffs where there is evidence of a link between the country of origin and the quality of the product. Where the vast majority of products are concerned, the country of origin has no impact on the quality of those products as quality is dependent on the production process that companies use rather than where the products originate. </p><p>There has been concern in the past that &lsquo;made in&rsquo; labels may be used as a protectionist measure to influence consumer behaviour to favour one country over another, which is not in keeping with EU values and could serve to undermine the operation of the Single Market.</p><p>For non-food products, there is no requirement to display a country of origin. However, Section 43 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that a commercial practice is misleading if:</p><p>- it includes false information in relation to the geographical or commercial origin of a product that would cause the average consumer to be deceived or misled, and</p><p>- it would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make.</p><p>A trader who engages in a misleading commercial practice under Section 43 commits an offence. </p><p>Section 46 of the Act further provides that a commercial practice is misleading if:</p><p>- the trader omits or conceals information that the average consumer would need to make an informed purchasing decision or provides that information in a manner that is unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely, and</p><p>- it would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make.</p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Section 9(5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions. Investigations and enforcement matters are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC.

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which contains commitments aimed at facilitating remote work across Ireland in recognition that remote work can provide benefits in terms of regional development, climate action and work-life balance.</p>  <p>  In July, my Department launched a public consultation on guidance for remote work. We received 522 submissions from employers, employees, representative bodies and special interest groups. Based on the analysis of the submissions, my Department is using the insights garnered to enhance and refine further current remote working guidance. The Department&rsquo;s guidance webpage will be updated regularly to reflect any changes made in response to the consultation, with the first update before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  A key commitment in the Programme for Government is the development of a Remote Work Strategy. My Department is committed to publish this before the end of the year. Work is currently taking place under the guidance of an Interdepartmental Group. The strategy will consider what changes are needed to develop an environment that encourages remote working solutions.</p>  <p>  In terms of facilities, there are a broad range of digital hubs currently operating across Ireland. These hubs provide diversity in the capacity, scale of facilities and services they offer. The Western Development Commission (WDC) has mapped over 100 of these hubs within the Atlantic Economic Corridor (AEC) region with the objective of developing these hubs into a cohesive network of facilities. </p>  <p>  My Department is represented on an Interdepartmental Working Group on hubs, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). This Group has been convened to investigate the feasibility of mapping and developing a national network of remote working facilities, based on the model of the AEC region.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million has been allocated to the Department of Rural and Community Development in Budget 2021 to support the development of this national hubs network as well as to upgrade the existing facilities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Through these initiatives, the Government is striving to develop a landscape in which employers and employees can reap the potential benefits remote work has to offer. </p></reply>

My Department has worked to ensure that appropriate supports are in place for businesses that require finance as they develop their response to their exposure to impacts arising from COVID-19. The uptake of these supports has been robust and indicates that businesses are taking action in response to this period of disruption.</p><p>Budget 2021 provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Restart Grant Plus, cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>As part of Budget 2021, the new Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), is now operational through Revenue and offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p><p>As a result of the fact that businesses have to close, we are making changes to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.</p><p>The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>Under the enhanced Restart Grant Plus Scheme, which was open for applications up to 31<sup>st</sup>October, business remaining closed and planning re-opening could receive a minimum of &euro;5,600 and a maximum of &euro;35,000, which could be used to help additional expense and adaptions associated with re-opening. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 31<sup>st</sup>August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7<sup>th</sup>September. </p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>These supports are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives. </p></reply>

The use of mobile technology has enabled many workers to remain connected and in employment, and those who can work from home have been encouraged to do so. </p>  <p>  However, a long-acknowledged, potential downside to the use of mobile and other electronic communication devices is the expectation that workers are always &lsquo;switched on&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Ireland already has a comprehensive body of employment legislation, including the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which sets out maximum working time and minimum rest periods for employees. Apart from a few limited exceptions, the terms of the Act apply to all employees, regardless of whether they are based in an office or working remotely. The Act places an obligation on employers to ensure that their employees take regular rest breaks and do not work excessive hours. Under Section 25 of the Act an employer is required to keep records of the working time of their employees. These records are subject to inspection by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). </p>  <p>  The Government wants remote working to become part of the new normal. If done right, the benefits will be huge, however it is vitally important that the existing rights and entitlements that employees enjoy are maintained and that an appropriate work-life balance is struck.</p>  <p>  As a response to Covid-19, a new web page was launched, dedicated to providing a central access point for  all guidance for working remotely. It allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance and legislation relevant to remote working and provides information for people working from home.</p>  <p>  The insights garnered from the recent public consultation on remote working will be used to enhance and  further refine the current remote working guidance and the Remote Work Strategy which will be published before the end of the year. An Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Remote Working was convened by my Department in September 2020 and its work is progressing. </p>  <p>  To complement the work of the new interdepartmental Strategy Group,  and in line with the Programme for Government commitment, I will be asking the WRC to consider what can be done through the development of a new Code of Practice or set of guidelines to ensure that both employers and employees are aware of their existing requirements and entitlements, and understand them, as they relate to a right to disconnect, including in a remote work scenario. </p></reply>

This study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The study found that regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy was still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit would have a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p>  <p>  The study provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. </p>  <p>  The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on employment. Significantly, in the model used in the study, the long run impact of Brexit on the labour market indicated that this would be employment neutral. This was based on the premise that changes in labour demand across sectors arising from Brexit would lead over the 10 year horizon of the study to redistribution of workers across sectors, with wages in each skills group adjusting in these sectors accordingly. </p>  <p>  This analysis, which was subsequently updated earlier this year, examined the trade implications arising from the adoption in 2019 of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  By its nature the 2018 study, and the latest iteration of that study, presents a broad trade analysis that concentrates on the long run economic context and potential employment impacts of different Brexit scenarios. It does not examine at a more granular level the economic impacts at sub-sector or regional level, or the employment impacts affecting different skill levels of the labour force.</p>  <p>  The type of analysis that the deputy refers to is more likely to be found in publications by the Central Bank. In its latest bulletin in early October, the Central Bank highlights the divergence between the continuing strength of the economy's exporting sector, dominated by pharmaceuticals, and the downturn due to Covid-19 restrictions brought upon the labour intensive domestic sector that has shed jobs.</p>  <p>  At national and regional level COVID-19 has obviously had a detrimental impact on levels of employment generally and, in particular on youth employment. This is further compounded with the onset of Brexit on 1 January next and I agree with the Deputy that this is a serious and ongoing concern. It is one that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection is engaged with and is actively looking at ways to mitigate the worst effects of the pandemic and Brexit on the employment opportunities for our young people. </p></reply>

A company must qualify as a small company (or micro company). As such, it is statutory provision and I would have no discretion in the matter.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Registrar of Companies has taken a number of decisions, in light of the Covid-19 situation, to assist companies with the filing of annual returns. In March, the Registrar announced that all annual returns, where the deadline for filing fell between 18th March 2020 and 30th June 2020 (both dates inclusive), would be treated as received on time if all elements were submitted by 30th June 2020. In May, this arrangement was further extended until 31st October 2020.  At that time, the Registrar indicated her reluctance to providing any further extension later in the year, being mindful of the need to balance the public interest in having up to date company information available against the difficulties caused by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Registrar did commit to keeping the situation under review and on 12th October announced a decision that any company with an Annual Return Date of between 30th September 2020 and 31st December 2020 (both dates inclusive) will be deemed to have filed on time if all elements of the annual return are completed and filed by 26th February 2021. </p>  <p>  For those companies with an Annual Return Date prior to 30th September, the Registrar has announced that the Form B1 must be filed online by 31st October and the remaining elements of the annual return will be accepted if delivered by the date indicated on the signature page.</p>  <p>  In a further response to the challenges being experienced by companies due to the Covid-19 situation, the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was enacted over the Summer and came into operation on 21st August 2020.  Section 6 of that Act provides that a company may opt to hold its Annual General Meeting on a date that is not later than 31st December 2020. Companies that need to avail of this provision can file annual returns up to 26th February 2021.  The CRO has advised that this should only be a necessity on an exceptional basis, where company rules require the financial statements to be laid before an AGM prior to filing an annual return, and such companies should get in touch with the CRO. </p>  <p>  I understand that significant numbers of companies have managed to file their annual returns and have not needed to avail of the full extended filing period.  The CRO has indicated that, as of 28th October, over 71% of companies who are due to file by end October have already completed their filing while a further 22% of companies have partly filed.  </p></reply>

The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and approximately 70,000 to 100,000 premises will be passed each year thereafter which will result in over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>As of 27 October, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and by year end NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork.  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.</p><p>As of 23 October, some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 6 schools have been connected with high speed broadband for educational access only. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at .</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. </p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan.

These figures are available on the SEAI website at .</p><p>The European Environment Agency Report Air Quality in Europe 2019 indicates that in 2016 there were 1,180 premature mortalities arising from air pollution in Ireland. The vast majority of these, 1,100, are attributable to fine particulate matter. The same report indicates 12,000 years of life lost, indicating significantly earlier mortality for those deaths. Banning smoky coal saves lives and improves health outcomes. </p><p>Ultimately in order to improve our air quality, we must reduce our reliance upon the burning of solid fossil fuels. This is being supported by an allocation of &euro;221 million for home and community retrofitting provided for in Budget 2021. This 82% increase on the 2020 budget is being funded through carbon tax revenue and includes &euro;109 million in additional supports for low income homes. </p></reply>

Last year, an Expert Advisory Group was formed to explore potential policy approaches to address the split-incentive and increase the number of rented properties undergoing energy upgrades.  The Group is comprised of representatives from my Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the SEAI and the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  Based on an analysis of policy approaches in other jurisdictions and input from stakeholders, the Group outlined a number of potential policy measures for a public consultation.  The consultation ran from December 2019 to late January 2020 and spanned both the private rented residential and commercial sectors. Over 90 submissions were received in response to the consultation. </p>  <p>  The results of the public consultation have been analysed by my Department and will inform the Expert Advisory Group's policy recommendations which will be submitted to the Minister in the first quarter of 2021. Submissions stressed the importance of striking the right balance between ensuring sufficient supply of rented accommodation and taking action to improve energy efficiency of the private rented stock.</p>  <p>  Currently, landlords can apply for grant support to upgrade their rental properties under the existing Better Energy Homes scheme. In addition, the SEAI recently launched the One Stop Shop Development Call as part of the National Retrofit Scheme. The findings of the consultation helped to inform the decision to include encouraging the retrofitting of rental properties as an objective of the scheme.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory Regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. The CRU regularly publishes market monitoring reports which include details of the number of domestic disconnections for non payment of account. The most recent annual report is available here . The CRU has published the following document  &quot;Arrears and NPA Disconnections January &ndash; September 2020&quot; at &quot;, which includes data for monthly disconnections for non payment of account for the period up to September 2020.This CRU document, already in the public domain, shows that for the period April to June 2020 there were no domestic disconnections.  For the period January to end September 2020, the total domestic monthly disconnections, again already available in the public domain, are 1,005 for electricity and 359 for gas.Given the CRU&rsquo;s responsibilities and statutory functions in respect of consumer protection, among the measures it took to protect consumers in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, was to put in place a temporary moratorium on domestic electricity and gas disconnections on 16 March, which ended on 29 June. Following the recent introduction of level 5 restrictions the CRU has put in place a moratorium on all disconnections of domestic energy customers from 24 October 2020 until 1 December 2020. </p><p>More generally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to talk to them as early as possible.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on electricity and gas regulatory matters, such as the one raised in this question, directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government is clear that the Government does not support the importation of fracked gas and commits to developing a Policy Statement to establish that approach. Such a policy statement is in development and includes consideration of any necessary legal/regulatory provisions. This includes detailed examination of the European energy and environmental frameworks, in which our national laws operate, to ensure the Policy Statement will be legally robust. Once finalised, I intend to bring the Policy Statement to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also sets out that the Shannon LNG terminal should not be included in the 2021 list of EU Projects of Common Interest.  If this project were to apply for inclusion in the 2021 list, Ireland would not provide the required Member State approval and therefore the project would not be included in the 2021 list.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. It will inform future policy in relation to natural gas supplies, gas storage, electricity interconnection, hydrogen, emergency reserves and other measures that would enhance our security of supply in the context of the doubling of the electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s final consumption and the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

As of 27 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. </p><p>  This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. </p><p>  Given that the contracted delivery of the National Broadband Plan State led intervention is over a 7 year period and the nature of the works involved in delivering a fibre telecommunications network, it is not possible to provide a detailed timetable on a Townlands basis. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (). In Clare, I can advise that surveys have commenced in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglas and Cloghrea and further surveys are due to commence in the areas of Kilkishen before the end of this year.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 23 October, some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 6 schools have been connected with high speed broadband for educational access only. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at . </p><p>  BCPs connected in County Clare include Cree Community Centre, Loop Head Lighthouse and Michael Cusack Visitor Centre, with other locations at Caherconnell and Flagmount to be connected in the coming months. A number of schools in Clare including Kilmurry McMahon, Shragh, Ennistymon and Stonehall National Schools will be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative. My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.</p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>  The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this roll out to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network roll out is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focused on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. </p><p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Eircodes are assigned to new property addresses using a valid postal address and verified geo-locations. An Post collects information on new and existing buildings, as well as changes to existing addresses and Ordnance Survey Ireland provides the geo-locations for these buildings.  An Post GeoDirectory, a subsidiary company of An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland, issue a new release of the GeoDirectory database file on a quarterly basis to Eircode in accordance with their licence agreement. </p>  <p>  Each new postal address assigned an Eircode is published on the free to use Eircode Finder website, a notification letter is issued to the property occupant containing the Eircode of that address and an updated Eircode Database is provided to licenced businesses for their use.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 27 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. In Meath surveys are due to commence in the areas of Dunboyne and Clonee before the end of the year.</p><p>  This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork.</p><p>NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website .  </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of theses are now connected with  high speed broadband service through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 6 schools have been connected with high speed broadband for educational access only. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at . </p><p>  In Meath, the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county including Meath Hill Community Centre, Meath Hill, Drumrath, which is connected with high speed broadband and is located just 2 kilometres from the premises in question. Other locations across the county include Cormeen Sports  Centre, Rathkenny, Boardsmill Community Centre, as well as Syddan, Drumree, and Castletown GAA clubs. Further details can be found at .</p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focused on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. </p><p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity.

While the level of natural gas used may reduce over the next decade, Ireland will continue to be dependent on natural gas as part of our energy mix in 2030. </p><p>The Programme for Government committed to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of natural gas in Ireland. It is not intended to revisit this commitment in the context of the factors noted by the Deputy or for any other reasons. </p><p>Currently over half of the natural gas we use is imported from the UK through the Moffat interconnection point in Scotland and two sub-sea interconnector pipelines, the vast majority of which comes from other European Countries with high standards of fossil fuel extraction and environmental management. </p><p>As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan published in September, a disruption to the supply of natural gas as a consequence of Brexit is not anticipated. My Department has worked with key State bodies, including the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland and Gas Networks Ireland, to ensure that they have updated plans in place. </p><p>It is expected that the current rules for trading natural gas across interconnectors with the UK will remain the same. However, in the case of any future gas supply emergency disruption, the UK will no longer be legally bound by current EU law obligations. Ireland is continuing to work with our EU partners in the negotiations with the UK to ensure continued future cooperation on natural gas security of supply.</p><p>In relation to the news articles the Deputy has cited, <font color="#221F1F">the</font>regulation of tariffs for use of the gas networks in the UK and Ireland is the responsibility of the independent energy regulators in their respective jurisdictions. In relation to tariff decisions made by the UK regulator, I would note that there is no suggestion of any restriction being placed on the trade of natural gas between the UK and Ireland.  </p><p>Finally, I would note that my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. I expect that the review to be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. </p><p>  This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The European Commission has presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The Government has welcomed the European Green Deal and supports the ambition set out therein.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the investment required to decarbonise our economies, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation.  Ireland will seek to maximise the drawdown of its share of this funding. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a Green New Deal for Ireland as a core mission. It commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with EU 2050 ambition. The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, currently in pre-legislative scrutiny, will strengthen the governance structure in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate breakdown, and will set the 2050 decarbonisation target in law.   </p>  <p>  This fundamental step change in ambition and broadening of our target horizon to a 7% average emissions reduction per annum will be underpinned by the core philosophy of a Just Transition. We are committed to ensuring that no sector of society or community is left behind in the movement to a low-carbon future. The Just Transition Fund is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s just transition plan for the Midlands region. A 2020 fund of &euro;11 million is available for projects focusing on retraining workers and proposals to generate sustainable employment in green enterprise in the region, and supporting communities to transition to a low carbon economy.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to far-reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver this expanded and deepened climate ambition including: delivering a National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030; developing a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewables; and implementing a major Waste and Circular Economy Action Plan. The measures required to achieve the 2030 ambition will be set out in an updated Climate Action Plan in 2021. </p>  <p>  In terms of national financing, &euro;30.4 billion is allocated for investment in climate action over the lifetime of Ireland's National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027. As part of the July Jobs Stimulus Plan, to help businesses adapt to the green economy, &euro;10 million will be provided to support businesses engaging in green research, development and innovation, capital investment, and capacity building, through the first phase of a new Green Enterprise Fund. Budget 2021 funding reflects this Government&rsquo;s ambition for a green, jobs-led recovery. In total, across Government, &euro;286.5 million has been committed to retrofit activity, and &euro;1.8 billion funding was announced for sustainable transport, cycling, walking, and greenways. The Government has announced a review of the National Development Plan, which will look at the appropriate amounts of funding across various areas such as climate action, housing and transport, and will be consistent with the Programme for Government.​</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is preparing a National Recovery and Resilience Plan to be submitted to the European Commission by 30 April 2021 in order to receive funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility. Our plan will set out a coherent package of reforms and public investment projects to be implemented up to 2026 and will include measures aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the green and digital transition.</p></reply>

A mandatory Community Benefit Fund must be provided by all projects successful in a RESS auction and the contribution for each project has been set at &euro;2/MWh. These funds will be aligned to incentivise investment in local renewable energy, energy efficiency measures and climate action initiatives. The community benefit fund under the first RESS auction which was held this year will deliver approximately &euro;4.5million a year to sustainable community initiatives targeted at those communities living in close proximity to the RESS-1 Projects.</p>  <p>  The first RESS auction also included a dedicated community projects category in which seven projects were selected for support. This will allow these seven communities to develop their own renewable energy projects - five solar and two onshore wind - and sell the energy back to the grid providing further benefits to their localities. It is my intention that communities all over the country should be able to generate electricity and reap the benefits in their own localities from the sale of that electricity. In that regard, I aim to ensure the delivery of some 100 community electricity generation projects by 2030. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure an adequate pipeline of such projects I have allocated an additional &euro;3 million in capital funding in Budget 2021 for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to stimulate locally-owned community energy projects. This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including information dissemination, trusted intermediary and advisor services and financial supports such as enabling grants.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the feasibility study, the Department has prioritised recommendations that addressed the most critical safety, human health and environmental concerns at the site.</p>  <p>  To date, in excess of &euro;5 million has been expended on remediation and monitoring costs at the site. As well as the health and safety work, environmental monitoring of the site is undertaken to ensure no significant change in conditions occurs without detection. An annual inspection of an underground tunnel, the 850 Adit, raised safety concerns about a section of the tunnel which passes under a local residential road in 2019.  This necessitated emergency repairs to the Adit between January and June 2020 to ensure its stability. </p>  <p>  The Department allocated &euro;1.1m funding for Avoca in 2020 of which in excess of &euro;900,000 has been spent to date on the recent safety work undertaken at the 850 Adit. Funding of &euro;450,000 is expected to be allocated for 2021. This funding will further support the monitoring of the site and will be used to re-evaluate the 2008 Feasibility study as a first step in the process to reappraise the approach to managing and restoring the site.</p></reply>

It is an independent statutory body, solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime wherein they are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. </p>  <p>  Section 10A of the Act, sets out the prescriptive procedure under which the Minister may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;. The process of Ministerial direction involves providing drafts of the direction to CRU, the Joint Oireachtas Committee and the Single Electricity Market (SEM) Committee, inviting them to provide views. The proposed Direction must include the reasons for the proposal.</p>  <p>  A policy direction cannot be given where the SEM Committee has informed the Minister that it would materially affect, or would be likely to materially affect, the Single Electricity Market.</p>  <p>  The Act precludes a policy direction in respect of a person who has applied for, or holds a licence, authorisation or consent, or a person to whom a licence, authorisation or consent may be granted by the Commission, or the performance of the functions of the Commission in relation to individual energy undertakings or persons.</p>  <p>  The European regulatory regime further circumscribes the power to issue a policy direction to CRU. EU Member States must guarantee the independence of their energy regulators, which are expressly forbidden from taking direct instructions from a government, or any public body. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded  is also a matter for the local authority. In the case of the four Dublin Councils, the arrangements in place since 2015 for the retention of Local Property Tax means that these Councils are required to largely self-fund their road programmes.</p>  <p>  The Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) is based on community contributions within the range of 15% to 30% and the purpose of the CIS is to facilitate local community participation in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which might not be high on the list of a local authority's annual roadwork programme.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of ring-fenced funding for  CIS programme in 2018 it was decided to provide funding over a two year period 2018/2019 so as to give local authorities more flexibility in delivering this programme. Towards the end of 2019, my Department invited local authorities to submit applications for CIS for another two year programme in the period 2020/2021.  Further applications for CIS projects will not, therefore, be sought until sometime next year.  Application of the scheme in urban and rural areas will be considered at that point taking into account all available resources.</p></reply>

As set out in the Living with COVID-19 Framework, the Government broadly supported this effort to improve coordination within the Union and has made clear our intention to align with the new Recommendation.</p>  <p>  Last week the Government made a decision on the approach to implementing the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system of categorising countries according to controls over the Covid-19 virus that was adopted on 13 October. </p>  <p>  Specifically the Government decided that persons arriving from green list locations can enter the State without the requirement to restrict movement or undergo testing for Covid-19. The default for persons arriving from orange or red locations should be to restrict movement for 14 days, with the exception of those exempted. The requirement on those arriving from orange locations to restrict movement could be dis-applied if they have negative test result of an appropriate pre-departure test carried out by an authorised entity (specific requirements to be confirmed). While the current requirement to restrict movement for 14 days following arrival from a red region remains until further notice, the Government agreed that as soon as practicable, passengers arriving from red regions should have the option to dis-apply the requirement to restrict movement following a negative result from an approved Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival. The same restrictions that apply for arrivals from red locations will apply for arrivals from grey locations.</p>  <p>  A senior group is to report back to Government by the 10th of November with a plan to establish a regime for testing for arrivals from red list regions.   </p>  <p>  For as long as the ECDC continues to report in data for the UK, that arrivals from Great Britain be subject to the same traffic light categorisation and restrictions as set out above for EU countries. An approach to third countries, notably the US, will be kept under review &ndash; for the present, arrivals from the US will be treated on the same basis as arrivals from red/grey regions. </p>  <p>  The proposed measures for arrivals from orange, red and grey regions, once implemented, will be reviewed fortnightly. </p>  <p>  Passengers travelling to Ireland will be asked to confirm before boarding that they are not symptomatic for Covid-19, nor have they tested positive in the last 14 days; that they are not a close contact of a confirmed case of Covid-19, and have not been advised by doctors to restrict their movements. If the answer to any of these questions is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;; the passenger should not be permitted passage. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed to maintain the position that no restrictions will be applied to International Transport workers. In addition and, in accordance with the EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function. </p>  <p>  The Passenger Locator form will remain in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the colour location they are arriving from. Essential transport workers will continue to be exempt from completing the form.</p></reply>

It is an SME sector, and as such travels agents and tour operators has access to all of the various business supports made available in the July stimulus package and in last month's Budget.  Budget 2021 contains historic levels of State support for the SME sector in the form of wage supports, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  </p>  <p>  In addition, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  Any queries in relation to the operation of the CRSS should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners. Taken together, I would be hopeful that these significant measures will help safeguard the travel sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.</p></reply>

A Steering Group chaired by the Director of the Irish Coast Guard was established last year to manage this process with a view to ensuring the next service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.  As key stakeholders, the Department of Defence and the Air Corps are fully engaged in these deliberations, including as members of this Steering Group. The process is on-going and will comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC), which include consideration of all available and realistic options for the delivery of the service.  </p>  <p>  As a first step in the Public Spending Code process, a Strategic Assessment and Preliminary Appraisal was conducted and agreed by the Steering Group. This went to Government for information in July. This assessment included considerations in relation to the risks, affordability and deliverability across a range of potential service delivery options including the Air Corps assuming full responsibility for the service. </p>  <p>  Given that the decision-making process in relation to this is still on-going and will lead to a Government decision ultimately, it would not be appropriate for me to release any specific details in relation to considerations around any one of the options considered as part of the Strategic Assessment and Preliminary Appraisal process. </p>  <p>  The next step is a detailed business case which is currently being prepared for Government. Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next service will be a matter for Government once the detailed business case has been finalised.  </p></reply>

To that end, CAT missions are not flown between the hours of 2300 and 0730 and accordingly the Coast Guard&rsquo;s helicopter service is not in a position to provide international patient transfer services from 1900 as travel time to and from UK has to be factored in.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the 2018 report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to Continental Europe under close review, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Since early 2019 my Department together with the IMDO has consulted closely with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe.  Shipping companies have assured my Department and the IMDO that they will respond to any increases in demand for direct maritime connectivity when border controls between the EU and the UK are introduced, and shipping companies have been adding capacity on routes to the Continent even during the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-2020. </p><p>The IMDO have very recently completed a review of the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 Landbridge Study and, in particular, the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO review confirmed that, at present, there is sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.  The IMDO review will be published shortly.  In addition, my Department in conjunction with the IMDO has recently completed a further round of consultation with shipping companies serving Ireland regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity at the end of the transition period.  </p><p>Given the spare capacity already available on routes from Ireland to Continental Europe and the spare freight carrying capacity of shipping companies serving Ireland and in the European shipping industry generally, identified by my Department and the IMDO, I am confident, including based on experience during the Covid-19 pandemic, that the shipping industry will respond quickly to any increase in demand for direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe from January 2021 onwards.  Any State intervention to provide direct shipping services in that context would be likely to undermine and disrupt a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place, legal challenges, and breaches of state aid rules with the requirement for repayment of any state aids provided with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any shipping companies receiving such aid.</p><p>As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving, in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods between Ireland and the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge.  Shipping companies should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening. </p><p>My Department, together with the IMDO, Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments and Agencies has recently launched a renewed communications campaign, <b>ACT</b>, which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now.  The <b>ACT</b>campaign encourages stakeholders:-</p><p>- To <b>Assess</b>their current routes to market;</p><p>- To <b>Communicate</b>their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and</p><p>- To <b>Trial </b>alternative services so that disruption to the UK Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.</p><p>More information on this campaign can be found on the IMDO website here: .</p><p>My Department, together with the IMDO, is continuing to closely monitor and keep under review the situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports, and will remain in close consultation with shipping companies, ports, hauliers, and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.  </p></reply>

In this context, the Department of Transport is in regular contact with Rosslare Port management about the infrastructural requirements and other Brexit impacts on the port. My Department is advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the Border Inspection Post at Kilrane will be fully ready for operation by 1 January. Plans for permanent facilities to be built within the Port are already underway by the State agencies. </p>  <p>  I understand also that Rosslare Europort is actively seeking opportunities arising from Brexit to expand shipping services from the port to continental EU ports.</p>  <p>  The Government has underlined the importance of the UK landbridge with the European Commission negotiating team and will continue to engage with our partners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany to ensure that the landbridge remains a viable and efficient route to market.  This is important for Rosslare.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that systems at Rosslare Port are Brexit-ready and adapted to take account of COVID-19 at the end of the transition period.  This work is essential to ensuring Rosslare Europort can continue to play its full role as a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that recent consultations regarding Rosslare&rsquo;s preparedness for Brexit between the port management, government agencies and shipping lines highlighted the general view that the Europort is well positioned to handle events beyond January 1, 2021.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government in 2021. This will involve identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. My officials have commenced work on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration when legislating.</p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters will remain illegal. </p>  <p>  There are two types of e-bikes both of which are already provided for in existing legislation. Pedal assisted electric bikes with a maximun speed of 25kph are treated as regular bikes. Pedal assisted electric bikes with a maximum speed of greater than 25kph are treated as low performance mopeds which require the appropriate licence, tax and insurance.</p></reply>

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  </p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services.</p><p>The Government's  <i>Living with Covid Plan</i>, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, frontline workers and those needing to travel to education.  </p><p>The move to 25% capacity utilisation on public transport is amongst the measures introduced under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Issues arising from the reduction of capacity arose on some services at the commencement of Level 5, in particular on some early morning bus services. The problem was most acute on buses early in the morning, particularly in the Dublin region. The return of schools this week is likely to again put the public transport system under pressure.</p><p>The NTA  issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;<i>particular pressure points</i>&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level. Since the implementation of Level 5 restrictions, Dublin Bus for example has redeployed additional vehicles to address particular problem areas, where possible, to mitigate the impact of capacity pressures on the network. I would like to thank operators and their staff, particularly drivers, who continue to provide a service in difficult circumstances to ensure essential workers and students can get to work and school.</p><p>Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. The NTA advise that the situation on Monday 2nd November, the return of schools following the mid-term beak, was much improved with a reduced level of capacity problems notified by transport operators.</p></reply>

The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licensed driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that the current pass rate for driving tests nationally stands at 52% for 2019, so having fulfilled all of the driving lesson requirements does not mean that an individual meets the standard required to pass the test. </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, even in the case of frontline workers, whose lives and safety are so precious at this time.</p>  <p>  Under Covid19 Level 5 Government restrictions effective from midnight on Wednesday 21 October, forsix weeks, driving tests are being provided for essential workers.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance.

The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation have also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p>  <p>  Further, under measures introduced as part of the July Stimulus package, self-employed operators can also avail of tax relief this year to offset losses from this year against profits from 2019. They can also avail of liquidity and investment measures including the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and the COVID-19 Business Loans Scheme which provides for loans of up to &euro;25,000 interest-free for six months, with a Government rebate available for the interest payable for the following six months</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also been tasked with developing a Business Continuity Scheme to help coach tourism businesses through this very difficult period. I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is engaging with the sector to develop and roll out this scheme as quickly as possible, which has been allocated &euro;10m in funding as part of the July stimulus package.</p></reply>

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  </p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services.</p><p>The Government's  <i>Living with Covid Plan</i>, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, frontline workers and those needing to travel to education.  </p><p>The move to 25% capacity utilisation on public transport is amongst the measures introduced under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Issues arising from the reduction of capacity arose on some services at the commencement of Level 5, in particular on some early morning bus services. The problem was most acute on buses early in the morning, particularly in the Dublin region. The return of schools this week is likely to again put the public transport system under pressure.</p><p>The NTA  issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;<i>particular pressure points</i>&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level. Since the implementation of Level 5 restrictions, Dublin Bus for example has redeployed additional vehicles to address particular problem areas, where possible, to mitigate the impact of capacity pressures on the network. I would like to thank operators and their staff, particularly drivers, who continue to provide a service in difficult circumstances to ensure essential workers and students can get to work and school.</p><p>Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. The NTA advise that the situation on Monday 2nd November, the return of schools following the mid-term beak, was much improved with a reduced level of capacity problems notified by transport operators.</p></reply>

I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p><p>As you are aware, driving tests were temporarily suspended due to the Covid 19 emergency and since resuming operations, there has been an increased level of demand. Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity is considerably reduced. </p><p>My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints. I am pleased to say, my Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May. The authority is also examining the recruitment and training of new driver testers. However, I would  like to stress that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p><p>Covid-19 has also had a profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s Driver Theory Testing Services and a significant backlog developed. </p><p>The Driver Theory Test service has seen its capacity reduced significantly to comply with occupational and public health requirements.<b></b>The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.  </p><p>However, as you will understand, the decision to move to Level 5, which is essential for public health reasons, is now likely to lead to further delays.  The driving test is being provided only for essential workers while Level 5 is in force, with theory tests being suspended.  </p><p>While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as Level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

Guidance on the safe use of face coverings is available on the gov.ie website.  </p><p>Under existing regulatory provisions for the SPSV sector, drivers already have the right to refuse carriage to a passenger who does not comply with a &quot;reasonable request&quot; which, in the present circumstances, would include a request to wear a face covering. </p><p>The wearing of face coverings on all mass transit forms of public transport has recently been made mandatory. The Department of Transport and the Department of Health collaborated to draft Regulations to extend this mandatory approach to include the SPSV sector and the draft regulations are now with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for final drafting. These Regulations will be made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act 1947.</p><p>It is expected that these Regulations will be made shortly.  In light of the public health advice, all drivers and passengers are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering while in an SPSV.</p></reply>

This is an essential safety check and an important road safety measure that provides for a reduction in road accidents by detecting defects such as faulty brakes, worn tyres or defective headlights.  This is all the more important for drivers as we face into the winter months.</p>  <p>  The applicable dates for periodic testing is provided for by national legislation. Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date.  Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle and any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued.</p>  <p>  The NCT certificate relates solely to the condition of testable items at the time of testing and does not constitute a warranty for their condition.  Earlier in the year, problems with vehicle lift equipment used by NCT Test Centres meant that, in certain cases, partial NCT inspections were undertaken with the omission of underbody inspections.  In general, when drivers presented their vehicle for the subsequent underbody inspection later in the year, the items tested as part of the initial NCT inspection were not retested.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate to attest to the roadworthiness of the items inspected earlier in the year at the time the latter inspection took place.</p></reply>

The imperative to do the theory test within a period of 6 weeks at Level 5 is therefore limited, as it would only accelerate people getting a learner permit.  It was decided, in a climate where only limited services are being provided in order to reduce the spread of Covid and where continuing services must be both safe and essential, that even if the theory test could be conducted safely it was not essential to the point of being needed during this 6 week period.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity is considerably reduced for both services.</p>  <p>  My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of driver tests within the current health constraints. I am pleased to say, my Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity.  However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased and scheduling additional overtime tests, including testing on Saturdays to increase capacity.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with the driver theory test service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.  </p>  <p>  However, as you will understand, the decision to move to Level 5, which is essential for public health reasons, is likely to lead to further delays with theory tests, as the Government decision and the public health regulations require that driver theory tests are suspended.</p>  <p>  I understand planning is underway to examine whether theory tests can be taken on line remotely. However, this planning is at a very early stage and is unlikely to come on stream in the near future. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity has been considerably reduced and this means that customers will experience longer waiting times for a test than was the case before the service was suspended.  The need to return to Level 5 restrictions from 22 October to 1 December 2020 for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing.  During the Level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.  </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during Level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after Level 5, and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. </p>  <p>  The Department has approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the RSA has also rehired a further 19 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May.  This will help to increase testing capacity.  In the longer term the Department is considering proposals by the RSA for further measures to address the backlog.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised it is prioritising driver testing for essential workers and has set up a dedicated email, urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie, where applicants can request to be given priority and supply supporting documentation.  These requests are prioritised during the scheduling process with cancellation slots being offered where possible.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as Level 5 is lifted. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the original 3 month payment break was extended by another 3 months for borrowers that requested it.  </p><p>As these expire, many borrowers are returning to repayment but many other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  This point was made very clear to the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks, and to the BPFI, by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself when we met them at the end of September.  It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  These arrangement could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.  </p><p>The Central Bank expects all lenders to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest repayments after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.  </p><p>With regard to loans to SMEs, regulated financial service providers are required to comply with the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015, which are generally referred to as the SME Regulations.  These set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.  </p><p>The SME Regulations also specify that borrowers must be informed about a regulated entity&rsquo;s internal appeal process in respect of a decision on whether to grant an alternative arrangement.  The SME Regulations also state that borrowers with participating lenders should be informed of the Credit Review Office where the participating lender&rsquo;s decision in relation to alternative arrangements are subject to review by the Credit Review Office.  The Credit Review Office () was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or have an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank or in relation to alternative arrangements for borrowers in difficulty. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the relevant participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB. </p><p>I would urge borrowers facing difficulties due to COVID-19 to contact their lenders as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements that will assist them to come through this difficult period.</p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p><p>Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment, which will be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to businesses. The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000.  This valuable upfront cash payment will enable eligible businesses to meet costs associated with their business premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions announced by the Government, they cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. </p><p>All eligible businesses can claim the support irrespective of their turnover levels, but the amount of the ACTE cannot exceed the lower of the amount based on 10%/5% of the relevant weekly turnover or &euro;5,000 per week.  </p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as a musician who does not perform from a fixed business premises or a coach or bus operator whose business is ordinarily operated from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.</p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  However, where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the business may qualify for the CRSS.</p><p>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).

The carbon tax was first implemented at a rate of &euro;15 per tonne of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission, the rate increased to &euro;20 in Budget 2012 and remained at that rate until it was increased to &euro;26 per tonne in Budget 2020.  In line with the Programme for Government commitment, Budget 2021 increased the rate to &euro;33.50 per tonne of CO<sub>2 </sub>applying immediately to auto fuels with a delayed implementation date of 1<sup>st</sup>May 2021 on all other fuels.  </p><p>Several studies have examined the distributional impacts of carbon taxation In Ireland.  In particular in relation to the most recent tax rate increases, research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland (ESRI) between 2018 and 2020 examined the distributional impacts of potential carbon tax rate increases as well as revenue recycling and compensation options.  These research papers are published and available to access on the website of the ESRI (www.esri.ie).  </p><p>In recognition of the fact that this research points to carbon tax increases disproportionately impacting low income households, the Government has taken steps to minimise the impact of the increase on heating costs.  I have delayed the increase on home heating fuels until 1st May in each year following the Budget announcement.  Both Budget 2020 and Budget 2021 also committed to ringfencing of all additional revenue arising from the increase for expenditure measures related to fuel poverty prevention, the Just Transition and investment in a low carbon economy.  Full details of this expenditure are available on the Budget website of the relevant year (www.budget.gov.ie).</p></reply>

The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p>  <p>  In the first instance I acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged the Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC are, on the basis of the Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a Primary Medical Certificate on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled. Notwithstanding this and in light of the Supreme Court decision I understand that the Medical Board of Appeal has issued Board Medical Certificates to the two successful litigants.   </p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. </p></reply>

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS already contains sufficient flexibility to take account of changes in business circumstances and is targeted at employers across all sectors who are most in need of support.  </p>  <p>  For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work.  Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.  The scheme requires that the employee must mainly use the bicycle and safety equipment for qualifying journeys.  This means the whole or part of a journey between home and the normal place of work.</p>  <p>  The Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 made some changes to the scheme, increasing the exemption limit from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 or, in the case of electric bikes, to &euro;1,500 for employer expenditure on the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment, and also enabling employees to avail of the scheme more frequently.</p>  <p>  Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation.  As stated above, an exemption from benefit-in-kind applies in relation to the cycle to work scheme, provided the required conditions are met.  However, where an employment does not exist, for example, as may be the case with retired people and old age pensioners, such individuals cannot qualify for the scheme.  Also, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed individuals, such individuals cannot qualify for the scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, as Minster for Finance I do not offer any grant schemes for personal transportation.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is responsible for electrical vehicle grants and comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></reply>

Consequently, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that current Government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is targeted on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems.  To achieve this aim there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - Investing almost &euro;1 billion on flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027;</p>  <p>  - the implementation of the Office of Public Works (OPW) flood relief management plans; and</p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.</p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland.  This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should in-turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood cover in these areas by insurance firms.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which my Department attends, meets on a quarterly basis to support this information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance in affected areas between 2015 and 2019, many householders are still experiencing difficulties.  This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences.</p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the challenges of property insurance and flooding and indeed this is one of the action points for my Department under the Climate Action Plan.  Over the last year it launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties.  The key themes that arose from the consultation related to (i) the lack of data on flood insurance coverage and (ii) the challenges of obtaining flood cover in areas with demountable defences.  My Department is now meeting with key stakeholders such as the OPW, Irish Public Bodies, the Central Bank of Ireland and the State Claims Agency to further review the issues raised and assess a feasible way forward.  This review is in progress and my Department will continue to provide updates on this work stream to the Climate Action Delivery Board.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to be proactively engage on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood insurance matter.</p></reply>

The scheme was predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picked up.  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  Legally, however, there was no requirement for a minimum amount that the employer had to pay as a normal wages payment to an employee to top up the wage subsidy.  The reason there was no such requirement was that many businesses were forced to close completely and would have had no capacity to continue to pay employees&rsquo; wages.  The purpose of the TWSS was to get much needed financial assistance to employees, while retaining the employer / employee relationship which facilitated the early recommencement of normal business when conditions permitted. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters that were outside the remit of the TWSS.  Essentially, the scheme had no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p>  <p>  Payments made under the TWSS are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and USC. </p>  <p>  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and are instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of the year (2020).</p>  <p>  Revenue will make a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement will also include information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement will provide employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and will indicate whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p>  <p>  Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees will have an opportunity to update their personal record, declare any additional income and claim any additional tax credits due, for example, qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p>  <p>  On 25 September 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, as to how any tax liability arising on the TWSS will be dealt with.  I am pleased to welcome this fair and flexible approach being taken by Revenue and I am confident that Revenue will continue to work with their customers to minimise any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible, noting that because of our progressive income tax system, in the vast majority of cases, the expected tax liability will be modest in scale.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months.  This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.</p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - www.bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Final-BPFI-Coming-off-the-COVID-19-Payment-Break.pdf<i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>However, I am very conscious that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may be in difficulty now for the first time.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  As the Deputies know, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September to discuss this matter and we indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties in meeting their loan repayments will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed. </p><p>Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19.  These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.  The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19.</p></reply>

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU.  If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues.  Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.   </p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme.  The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme.  This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive.  The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. </p>  <p>  The Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Any changes to the operation of the scheme will of course be kept under review by Revenue.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is statutorily bound to confidentiality in respect of taxpayer information and by law Revenue is prohibited from disclosing taxpayer information to third parties, including to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (or "TCA 1997") formalises taxpayer confidentiality and reassures taxpayers that their personal and commercial information disclosed to Revenue for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure by Revenue to third parties.  Revenue is also obliged by section 851A TCA 1997 to ensure that information about individual taxpayers or a small group of taxpayers cannot be deduced from any statistical reports or similar information published by Revenue. </p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s first query concerned the payment of dividends from an Irish tax resident company to a non-resident shareholder without deduction of Irish tax.  I am advised by Revenue that the general rule concerning dividend withholding tax or &ldquo;DWT&rdquo; is contained in section 172B TCA 1997.  This provides that DWT at a rate of income tax of 25% applies to all &lsquo;relevant distributions&rsquo; made by Irish resident companies, including payments of cash dividends.  The DWT must be deducted at the time the distribution is being made and paid to Revenue by the 14th of the following month, unless the company has satisfied itself that the recipient is entitled to receive the distribution without the deduction of DWT.  For example, section 172D(3) TCA 1997 provides an exemption from DWT in the case of certain non-resident persons which are resident for tax purposes in another EU Member State or a country with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty.  Therefore, where an Irish tax resident company pays a dividend to a non-resident shareholder meeting the criteria set out in section 172D(3) TCA 1997, DWT does not have to be deducted from the dividend payment by the Irish tax resident company.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s second query, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the overall framework for the taxation of income from a trade consisting of petroleum activities, a trade which is the focus of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The taxation of activities in the oil and gas sector is a specialised area and I am advised that Chapter 2 of Part 24 TCA 1997 contains a number of specific provisions which deal with the taxation of petroleum activities.  Petroleum activities includes both petroleum exploration activities and petroleum extraction activities.  For this purpose, petroleum has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and includes &ldquo;any mineral oil or relative hydrocarbon and natural gas and other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons and their derivatives&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Companies involved in petroleum extraction activities incur significant costs in the context of both petroleum exploration activities and petroleum extraction activities and significant capital expenditure on production and development in connection with an oil or gas field.  I understand that on the commencement of a trade of petroleum extraction by a company, all of its past petroleum exploration expenditure is deductible against the income from its petroleum activity.  In addition, a 100% write down allowance is available for capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, assets or other works, buildings or structures, used in the carrying on of a petroleum extraction activity.  This write down allowance is available from the date of production or development commenced in commercial quantities for the field in question.  I am advised that any unutilised allowances on petroleum exploration expenditure and capital expenditure on production or development of an oil or gas field can be carried forward to shelter income in future trading periods. </p>  <p>  Income from a trade consisting of petroleum activities is subject to corporation tax at the rate of 25%.  Furthermore, it is important to note, that petroleum activities are ring-fenced from other trading activities to prevent erosion of the tax base which would result from non-petroleum profits being sheltered by deductions in respect of the substantial costs attributable to petroleum development.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the information outlined above is provided so as to be helpful to the Deputy and in the context of Revenue&rsquo;s specific confidentiality obligations.  It relates to the general taxation rules applying to the payment of dividends from an Irish tax resident company to a non-resident shareholder and a trade consisting of petroleum activities.  It does not relate to any specific entity or group of entities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.1090.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300100#WRX00400"><p>In relation to my reply of 20 October in relation to the risk presented by the State acting as an insurer for artists and the live events sector, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the following factors. </p>  <p>  Specifically with regard to competition, the concern I have with such a proposal is that it could compound what some see as the &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of risk within the market by insurers.  In turn, this could further decrease market competition for these or other sectors over the longer term, as some insurers may stop insuring specific risks, particularly if there is a view that a State company is willing to insure those lines of business that could be considered as being less profitable.  While potentially having a negative impact upon pricing and possibly on supply, this could also create a large Exchequer exposure if significant losses were incurred. </p>  <p>  Also of relevance to both competition and pricing is that any State insurer would be required to comply with the same prudential rules under the Solvency II Directive, as private companies.  The Deputy will be aware that the Solvency II Directive is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of market access, but also with regard to the level of supervision and tregulation.  Accordingly, the Directive plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, could therefore direct the pricing or provision of insurance at a rate lower than other commercial operators for these market segments as it could be deemed as anti-competitive behaviour.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the cost of any insurance provided by the State would still have to reflect the risk involved.  Consequently, there is no guarantee that cover could actually be provided, and if it were, there could be no certainty that it would be much cheaper than existing equivalent private insurance products.  Finally, there is no reason to believe that a State run insurer could provide cover in a more efficient way than a private one.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, any such proposals for State intervention, while well intended and which may appear as representing an easy solution, are likely to lead to unintended consequences, such as insurers withdrawing from further sectors on the presumption the State will insure loss-making risk.  These outcomes would undermine the primary policy goal of decreasing the cost of insurance and increasing the availability of insurance to consumers and businesses.   Accordingly, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a solution to the cost or availability of insurance, either for the arts, entertainment and events industry or other market segments more generally. </p></reply>

The submissions received, proposed a number of policy changes in relation to the moneylending industry and are broadly in favour of introducing an interest rate restriction. </p>  <p>  A number of potential policy proposals are being prepared in light of these submissions and I expect to receive a draft report setting out these proposals for my consideration in the coming months. Key to this process will be trying to balance improvements for borrowers with the potential for unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion, if the supply of credit is reduced.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank published Regulations on 8 June 2020 to strengthen protections for consumers of licensed moneylending services and to enhance professional standards in the sector. The regulations include a requirement on Moneylenders to include prominent, high cost warnings in all advertisements for moneylending loans with an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) over 23 per cent. The warning must also prompt consumers to consider alternatives. The regulations will come into effect on 1 January 2021. However, recognising the financial effects of COVID-19 on consumers, the &lsquo;high-cost warning&rsquo; requirement in respect of advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR in excess of 23% came into effect on 1 September 2020.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is available to anyone experiencing problems with budgeting and debt. Furthermore, I would encourage anyone who is in receipt of a social welfare payment to explore the option of a Personal Micro Credit Scheme Loan. These loans are branded as the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo; and are offered through the credit union network. 108 credit unions and 173 sub-offices (281 locations in total) are now in a position to offer the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo;.</p></reply>

This guidance issued in March 2020 and is summarised below. </p><p>Where an employee is in receipt of a vehicle (car or van) provided by his or her employer, the following may apply:</p><p>(a) Employer Takes Back Possession of the Vehicle</p><p>Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period.</p><p>(b) Employer Prohibits Use</p><p>Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use. Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited the vehicle&rsquo;s use and that no such use has occurred, e.g. communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer, etc.</p><p>(c) Employer Allows Private Use</p><p>Where an employee is not prohibited from using a vehicle, but limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken during the period of the COVID-19 crisis, the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Personal use of the vehicle must be limited in this scenario and appropriate records should be kept, e.g. business mileage travelled in January 2020, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer, etc.</p><p>Employee Continues Working</p><p>Where an employee continues to undertake business travel as usual in an employer-provided vehicle, the usual BIK rules will apply.</p><p>Guidance on the above and other COVID-19 related matters can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available here.</p><p>Finally, the concessional treatment in this instance and in relation to all other matters is kept under regular review by Revenue and updated accordingly. </p></reply>

In Finance Act 2018 in order to ensure better value for money I limited this exemption to the first &euro;50,000 of the original market value (OMV) of the electric vehicle. </p>  <p>  What this means is that an employee or Director, who as part of their remuneration package is provided with an electric car for their private use, where that car has an original market value of &euro;50,000 and will be a low mileage car, will avoid paying PAYE, PRSI and USC on &euro;15,000 of notional income for every year they have the electric car.      </p>  <p>  This is an exceptionally generous BIK EV regime and by end 2022 it will have been in place 5 years. This is in addition to the &euro;5,000 EV SEAI buyers grant and the &euro;5,000 EV VRT relief that companies benefit from when they acquire electric vehicles. </p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I provided for the introduction of a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime from 2023, where the BIK rate for low emission cars ranges from 9% to 22.5%. This current rate for low mileage cars is 30%. The current EV BIK exemption on the first &euro;50,000 OMV is scheduled to lapse at end 2022 - so at a minimum it has a further two years to run.</p></reply>

I understand that BPFI along with its member banks and with support from Safeguarding Ireland have developed a guide which provides advice on how you can best prepare for a time when you may need assistance to properly manage your money. The guide, <i>Safeguarding Your Money Now and in the Future</i>, is available here: <i>www.bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BPFI-Safeguarding-Customers-Guide-FINAL.pdf.</i></p><p>I am advised by the Central Bank that its consumer protection framework is designed to ensure that customers&rsquo; best interests are protected. Regulated entities must provide reasonable arrangements and/or assistance to people who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19. All regulated firms should take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers.</p><p>A review of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) is currently underway. Amongst other things, the review will consider whether the provisions that relate to vulnerability remain appropriate, and whether they need to be enhanced.  A public consultation on the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals for amendments will take place in 2021 giving all stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions. This review will also include transferring the Code into regulations in line with the regulation making powers given to the Central Bank in the <i>Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013</i>.</p><p>The Code currently defines a vulnerable consumer as follows:</p><p><i>&ldquo;A &ldquo;vulnerable consumer&rdquo; means a natural person who:</i></p><p><i>a) has the capacity to make his or her own decisions but who, because of individual circumstances, may require assistance to do so (for example, hearing impaired or visually impaired persons); and/or</i></p><p><i>b) has limited capacity to make his or her own decisions and who requires assistance to do so (for example, persons with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties).&rdquo;</i></p><p>Provision 3.1 of the Code provides that: &ldquo;Where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity.&rdquo;</p><p>Provision 2.11 of the Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it &ldquo;without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not, through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services&rdquo;. This provision aims to ensure that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services.</p><p>In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, banks are helping customers who are cocooning to manage their banking in a safe way without leaving their home. The retail banks have dedicated phone lines to assist cocooning customers during the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>I would also like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) which is an independent statutory body with a statutory role in relation to financial education. The CCPC carries out this role by running public awareness campaigns on personal finance issues, providing online comparison tools for various financial products and providing personal finance information on its consumer website, including advice on avoiding scams. The CCPC also fulfils its statutory role in the development of financial education and capability by delivering financial education programmes for workplaces and schools and conducting research, such as the <i>Financial Capability and Well-being in Ireland in 2018 </i>study, to inform its financial wellbeing strategy and priorities.</p></reply>

The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. </p>  <p>  Payments made under the TWSS and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), which is administered by the Department of Social Protection, are income supports and as such are taxable in nature. While the TWSS is liable to both income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC), the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and is exempt from USC and PRSI charges. </p>  <p>  The EWSS operates differently to the TWSS in that it is a flat-rate subsidy that is payable to employers based on the number of eligible employees included on their payroll. Eligible employees are defined as those earning weekly gross wages of between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462. The EWSS also re- establishes the requirement for employers to operate the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; PAYE system each time they pay their employees and deduct income tax, USC and PRSI. These normal (real-time) deductions were not operated for TWSS payments, which will be taxed at year end.</p>  <p>  To minimise the end of year tax impact on employees who received TWSS payments, Revenue placed them on the &lsquo;week 1/month 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation from 21 June 2020. The &lsquo;week 1/month 1 basis&rsquo; preserves employees&rsquo; unused tax credits, which can then be offset against any accumulated tax liabilities at year end, including in respect of TWSS and PUP. Any additional credits that an employee may have, for example health expenses, may also be used to further reduce the accumulated tax liability. Any tax liability that still exists once all available credits have been offset can be paid over a four-year period from January 2022 by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits for those years.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that, according to its records, the person in question received a combination of TWSS and PUP payments during the months of March to August 2020. Her employer also received EWSS subsidy payments for September 2020. In accordance with the rules of the TWSS, the payments were paid gross to her without &lsquo;normal&rsquo; income tax or USC deductions applying, which instead fall due at year end. </p>  <p>  The PUP payments received by the person from the Department of Social Protection during the period in question were also paid gross and the associated income tax liabilities, as with the TWSS, fall due at year end. </p>  <p>  The EWSS payments currently being received by the employer are flat-rate subsidies and have no direct bearing on the person&rsquo;s take-home pay and the employer is obliged to deduct income tax, USC and PRSI from her gross wage in the normal manner. The level of gross wage is a matter between the employer and the person.</p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s exposure to tax on the subsidy amounts will be reduced by the tax credits that were preserved on her behalf through the &lsquo;week 1&rsquo; basis of taxation and may be reduced further if she has any additional credits to claim.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed that it will make direct contact with the person in the coming days to explain how the subsidy schemes operate and to clarify the tax implications for her.</p></reply>

I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures, or the continuation of  measures which are due to terminate, should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to re-introduce the scheme.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the original 3 month payment break was extended by another 3 months for borrowers that requested it.  </p><p>As these expire, many borrowers are returning to repayment but other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  This point was made very clear to the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks, and to the BPFI, by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself when we met them at the end of September.  It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  These arrangement could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate, more long term arrangements. Each case is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.  </p><p>The Central Bank expects all lenders to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest repayments after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.  </p><p>With regard to loans to SMEs, regulated financial service providers are required to comply with the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015, which are generally referred to as the SME Regulations.  These set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. It includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.  </p><p>The SME Regulations also specify that borrowers must be informed about a regulated entity&rsquo;s internal appeal process in respect of a decision on whether to grant an alternative arrangement.  The SME Regulations also state that borrowers with participating lenders should be informed of the Credit Review Office where the participating lender&rsquo;s decision in relation to alternative arrangements are subject to review by the Credit Review Office.  The Credit Review Office (<i>www.creditreview.ie</i>) was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or have an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank or in relation to alternative arrangements for borrowers in difficulty. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the relevant participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB. </p><p>Receivership and the appointment of receivers is a commercial decision for regulated financial service providers to make on a case-by-case basis. The Companies Act 2014 is the relevant legislation, which is under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>I would urge borrowers facing difficulties due to COVID-19 to contact their lenders as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements that will assist them to come through this difficult period. </p></reply>

However, as stated above the voucher cannot be redeemed in full or in part for cash. Vouchers, which are fully or partially redeemable for cash, are considered perquisites, and therefore liable to tax in the usual way (i.e. subject to tax through the payroll when given to the employee). </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the requirement that only one voucher issues per year is concessionally waived for the 2020 tax year, in circumstances where an employer wishes to recognise efforts of front-line or other key staff working during the COVID-19 crisis. Further guidance on this concession can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, <i><font color="#0000FF">available here</font></i>.</p><p>I have no plans to change the Small Benefit Exemption at present.</p></reply>

Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p></reply>

Carbon Tax, as part of an overall suite of measures to incentivise decarbonisation, aims to encourage businesses and householders alike to use greener alternative fuels where possible.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the application of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax on coal and smokeless coal ; &lsquo;coal&rsquo; is defined in section 77 of the Finance Act 2010 as any fuel in solid form manufactured from coal falling within the EU customs classification Combined Nomenclature (CN code) 2701 or from lignite falling within the CN code 2702 or any energy product within the meaning of Article 2.1 of the Energy Tax Directive (2003/96/EC) in solid form. Solid Fuel Carbon Tax legislation does not set out separate definitions and rates for &lsquo;smokeless coal&rsquo; and &lsquo;regular coal&rsquo;. </p>  <p>I understand that distinctions between regular and smokeless coal are made in the regulatory regime for environmental standards of solid fuel that is overseen by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is enforced by local authorities in areas that are designated for use of certain types of solid fuel under air pollution legislation.  This is a separate legal and regulatory regime and is not linked to the rates of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax, which is based on the amount of CO2  emitted by a given solid fuel product.</p></reply>

These guidelines were originally applicable until 30 June 2020 and their application was subsequently extended to 30 September 2020. On the 21 September 2020 the EBA announced that there would not be a further extension to the guidelines. The EBA has made no further official announcements in relation to the extension or reintroduction of guidelines on payment breaks. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering further payment breaks to borrowers. Lenders must however ensure that such a solution is appropriate for the individual borrower's circumstance.</p>  <p>  Lenders are expected to work with borrowers who are still experiencing repayment difficulty at the end of a COVID-19 payment break in a pro-active and sympathetic manner and with the objective of assisting borrowers to meet their mortgage commitments. It is important to note that in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), lenders can offer borrowers a variety of options depending on a number of factors specific to their own circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank recently stated that by early October, there were under 54,000 active payment breaks associated with Irish borrowers. It noted that 40% of active payment breaks for Irish borrowers relate to mortgages, which represents 3.4% of outstanding Irish mortgages. </p>  <p>  I have had several meetings with the CEOs of our retail banks and with Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI). I met with them on 18 March, 11 May and more recently on 28 September, to discuss the issue of payment breaks. At my most recent meeting, the discussion focused on the options available to borrowers once payment breaks expire and at this meeting the banks committed to sympathetically engaging with borrowers who require on going assistance on a case by case basis. </p></reply>

The three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings in July that they were considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS, is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p></reply>

The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  </p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available. Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI and USC.</p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>Revenue also advise that there has been no recent change in policy in relation to this payment.  This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 was, and still is, at the discretion of the employer.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. </p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. I am advised by Revenue that where a deduction in respect of expenses in relation to working from home is claimed in a tax return, the amounts are included in a general &lsquo;Expenses&rsquo; field. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the number or value of specific claims in relation to these expenses.</p><p>I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM e-Working and Tax.  </p><p><i>Finally, the 2020 Programme for Government: Our Shared Future</i>contains several commitments related to working from home, including an examination of the &ldquo;<i>feasibility and merits of changing tax arrangements to encourage more people to work remotely</i>&rdquo;, the responsibility for which falls to my Department.  There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;<i>national remote working strategy</i>&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p></reply>

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  </p>  <p>  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. </p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. </p>  <p>  Six departments participated in the Equality Budgeting pilot: Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Department of Health, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Following work to expand the programme, three further departments are now reporting on Equality Budgeting goals; Department of Justice and Equality, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment. As work to progress the programme continues, it is expected that a number of further departments will begin reporting on equality goals later this year.  </p>  <p>  To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.</p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced and is being informed also by the views of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group. One example of progress is in relation to recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting. Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO has conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and is published on the CSO website at: www.cso.ie/en/methods/methodologicalresearch/rp-eda/equalitydataaudit2020/. Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. </p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government, the Government has also set out its commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people; and ensure that the well-being framework will be utilised in a systematic way across government policymaking (at local and national levels) in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).</p>  <p>  At present, officials in my Department are developing a programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment with regard to well-being.  This work programme will be progressed on a cross-Governmental basis in liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance and other government departments as well as key stakeholders and experts in this area. Once developed, the framework will complement existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.</p>  <p>  One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policymaking across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, deliver on the OECD recommendations step-by-step, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle.</p></reply>

SEUPB's primary responsibility is the management and implementation of cross-border North South EU funding programmes. </p>  <p>  At present the SEUPB is responsible for the delivery of two 2014-20 EU cross-border programmes, INTERREG VA and PEACE IV, which have a combined value of &euro;553 million. The two programmes cover an eligible area of Northern Ireland, the border counties of Ireland (i.e. Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan) and (in the case of INTERREG VA only) Western Scotland. INTERREG VA supports the development of economic and social cohesion with total funding of &euro;283m, while the PEACE IV programme continues to foster peace and reconciliation across the eligible area with total funding of &euro;269m. As of 30 September 2020 INTERREG VA is 103.2% committed in support of 34 projects, while PEACE IV is 103.1% committed in support of 96 projects.

Significant success was achieved in recent months by many Departments and Agencies in setting up new working environments at very short notice enabling personnel to work remotely. These arrangements contrasted significantly to normal working operations. </p>  <p>  OPW&rsquo;s remit is the provision of appropriate workplaces for the Civil Service, in the context of a central HR policy around remote working, and in parallel with the ICT infrastructure that is required to enable this. I am advised that my officials in the OPW are actively engaged in a central group established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to advance a policy on remote working. Based on experiences over recent months, many Departments are likely to be open to alternative workplace concepts and processes that heretofore would have been seen as challenging to the work of the Civil Service. OPW will be centrally involved in assisting with any emerging, alternative work practices that are aligned to the Programme for Government and could achieve positive outcomes for client Departments.  </p>  <p>  All office accommodation provided by OPW will continue to adhere to all building regulations prevailing at the time of acquisition.  Through the hosting of a series of webinars, OPW has assisted Civil Service Departments on the issue of operating office spaces in a Covid environment and how best to manage the issue of staff returning to the office.  OPW will continue to follow all health advices that emerge during the Covid period and will, if necessary, update its office guidelines as the pandemic environment evolves. </p></reply>

These arrangements were temporarily suspended in April 2020 to facilitate the required new ways of working across the public service.  Many public servants are still working remotely as part of these temporary measures and in order to support public health measures rather than under a long term remote working strategy. </p><p>As more public servants have returned to their workplaces over recent months, flexi-time arrangements were re-introduced, with effect from 24 August 2020, for those employees who are attending the work premises on their pre-COVID arrangements. </p><p>Any further changes to the suspension of flexi for other civil and public servants will be considered in the wider context of the overall  response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to COVID-19 is reviewed on a weekly basis and officials in the Department consult with both civil and public service employers and union representatives in this regard. </p></reply>

A Steering Group has been established at CEO level, to oversee the process of developing new transport and mobility options for the Park.  By engaging with these organisations, I hope to ensure that future plans for access and mobility to and within the Park are integrated with the wider traffic and transport plans for Dublin City and surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  This approach ought to ensure that well-considered options, suitable from an operational perspective, can be identified and taken forward for public consultation.  I have asked the Steering Group to revert to me with a report including proposed options by the end of this month.  The next step will be to bring these forward to public consultation early in 2021 and I hope to publish the final plans for implementation of the preferred options soon thereafter.</p>  <p>  With regard to Level 5 COVID-19 restrictions as recently published by the Government, parks continue to remain open with protective measures in place.  While the Phoenix Park is experiencing high levels of demand and large volumes of visitors, it should be noted that there are 1,350 dedicated car parking spaces within the Park and a further 650 spaces at Farmleigh.  Staff with responsibility for patrolling the Park closely monitor traffic in the Park and have installed temporary parking control measures at key locations over busy weekends.  OPW encourages all visitors to the Park to comply with the 5Km travel restrictions, to use sustainable modes of transport where possible and, if they must arrive by car, that they park responsibly.</p>  <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also monitors traffic and associated activities including parking within and adjacent to the Phoenix Park.

I have decided that to progress this commitment, a full review of ethics legislation will be undertaken by my Department. I am strongly committed to progressing this review.

Preliminary work on the review has commenced within my Department. </p><p>Following this review, a new consolidated Ethics Bill will be brought forward for consideration by the Oireachtas. In the interim, the existing ethics framework remains in force.

Various means are used by the individual public sector employers to facilitate this process.

The most recent guidance issued by my Department on the matter is Circular 19/2019, which is available online at: www.gov.ie/en/circular/b5d982-circular-192019-further-instruction-on-the-pension-increase-policy-I/.</p>  <p>  It appears that the matter to which the Deputy is referring arises from the application of the pension increase policy to situations in which a pensionable fixed periodic allowance (rent allowance, in the case of Prison Officers) was increased and then consolidated into the relevant salary scales. This issue, which is not explicitly addressed under the terms of the PSSA, is under active review by my Department and it is expected that relevant guidance will be issued shortly to the National Shared Services Office.</p></reply>

There are important measures in place at all times to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. This relates to Covid-19 related expenditure as it does to all other expenditure in the normal course of events. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2020 was &euro;65,547 million. This is &euro;8,604 million, or 15.1% ahead of profile. It should be noted however, that expenditure profiles for the year were published in February and are based on the expenditure allocations set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume. This means that the impact of additional resources allocated in respect of Covid-19 are not reflected in these profiles. As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019.</p>  <p>  Additional resources allocated to Departments in respect of Covid-19 for 2020 were reflected in the Pre-Budget Expenditure Update, published on October 6th. This expenditure, as well as additional measures announced as part of Budget 2021 was also reflected in the 2020 expenditure ceiling published in Expenditure Report 2021, published on Budget Day, October 13th  . These additional allocations were also set out at a Departmental level in the report, in order to allow for oversight of where additional funds are going. The majority of this additional expenditure has been reflected in 2020 Estimates presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with the remainder to be presented in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  With regard to Health spending in particular, a Budget Oversight Group was established in 2019 to monitor health spending and act as an early warning mechanism. The Budget Oversight Group is made up of senior representatives from DPER, D/Health and the HSE The overarching purpose of the group is to monitor health current expenditure and staffing within budget allocations and act as an early warning mechanism for any deviations. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, this group meets on a regular basis and the minutes of each meeting are published on the DPER website here: www.gov.ie/en/collection/31f5d3-hbog-finance-subgroup-minutes/.</p></reply>

In this context I have taken the opportunity to meet with the relevant parties involved in these schemes to hear at first hand their issues of concern. </p>  <p>  The particular matter raised by the Deputy is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and exchequer cost issues. The Deputy may be aware that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. A detailed scoping exercise was carried out  in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. </p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue. While CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors represent a small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, consideration must be taken for the potential liability to the State if similar claims are made by the many workers in the broader community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, we are now facing major challenges in managing the public finances. However, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection  I am giving fresh consideration to all the issues involved in relation to this matter and will continue to engage constructively with the relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Music Stimulus Package involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and traditional folk. Under this package, a fund of &euro;1.7 million has been put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources, including live event fees. These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases. The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and ensure their work in the context of COVID-19 restrictions. The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p>  <p>  Under the live performance supports pilot scheme, a further allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available, which aims to assist commercial venues, producers, promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in creative industries.  Allocations under this scheme were announced this week.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be also aware that I appointed the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force, which is being chaired by Clare Duignan. The membership of that task force includes representatives from the music industry. Taken as a starting point, the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by the Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the task force's report will set out recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the pandemic.</p></reply>

This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country.  The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders.  It will also build on, and be informed by, the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.  The pilot scheme was available to promoters whether or not they owned their own premises.  There will be further supports for music, building on the very significant demand for support under the Music Scheme operated by First Music Contact.  Combined with measures announced by the Minister for Finance, this will provide additional supports to a sector severely impacted by COVID-19.  </p><p>These measures are in addition to other supports common to other or all sectors including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, restart grants, exemptions from commercial rates, the warehousing of tax liabilities, and the reduction in VAT on ticket sales. In addition, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment  is available to all employees and the self-employed who have lost their job due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  There are also a range of schemes available including the  COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme which offers loans  from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million, for terms of up to five and a half years, and COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;25,000 which are available through Microfinance Ireland with zero repayments and zero interest for the first 6 months and the equivalent of an additional 6 months interest-free subject to certain terms and conditions. </p><p>Details of all of these supports are available at  . </p></reply>

The only facilities not covered by this requirement are those set out in the public health regulations concerned. Given the prevailing incidence of covid in the community generally, there are no plans to alter the current Level 5 measures for these facilities.</p>  <p>  The Framework for Restrictive Measures is a risk management strategy designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease.</p>  <p>  It is framed to account for periods where there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters, low community transmission, through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. Notwithstanding the emergence of some encouraging trends in recent days, the latter is clearly the position currently pertaining in Ireland, in common with many other countries and relaxation of current measures is not envisaged in current circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, poorly ventilated spaces. A range of public health measures and guidance is in place to help prevent transmission.</p>  <p>  The framework takes account of the societal and economic impacts of the response to COVID-19. Nuanced and sectoral responses are in place to ensure the number of people impacted will be kept to the minimum necessary to control the disease given the psycho-social impacts of the disease on the population.</p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and growing hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including the vast majority of sporting activities and the use of gyms and other leisure centres.</p>  <p>  While the Government fully understands the benefits that facilities such as those provided in gyms, leisure centres and through exercise classes generally bring to peoples overall health and well-being, the measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests such as sports and important family gatherings. </p>  <p>  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully aware of the impacts that COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being. The &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, launched on 29th October, is aimed at showing people of all ages how we can mind our own physical and mental health and wellbeing by adding healthy and helpful habits to our daily and weekly routines.  It provides guidelines, information, and tips on things that will help us keep well through the coming months. Information in this regard in available on gov.ie/healthyireland. </p>  <p>  It is also appropriate to emphasise that Sport Ireland, an agency under my Department, is leading a series of initiatives that will support people to stay active in their own local areas throughout the  winter. The Local Sports Partnerships especially can play a key role in assisting local communities and groups to keep active during these challenging and difficult times. Information on contacts and the range of initiatives being pursued is available on Sport Ireland's website. </p></reply>

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including much sporting activity, including tennis, and there are no plans to amend the current public health regulations as proposed in the Deputy's question.   </p>  <p>  The Government fully understands the benefits that sport generally, including tennis, provides to peoples overall health and well-being and understands how difficult the public health measures are for individuals and businesses. The measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests (in so far as possible) such as sports and important family gatherings. </p>  <p>  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the impacts COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being. The &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, launched on 29th October, is aimed at showing people of all ages how we can mind our own physical and mental health and wellbeing by adding healthy and helpful habits to our daily and weekly routines.  It provides guidelines, information, and tips on things that will help us keep well through the coming months. Relevant information is this regard is available on gov.ie/healthyireland.</p></reply>

This funding package includes COVID-19 funding of &euro;70 million, which will provide support for the three main field sports organisations (the FAI, GAA and IRFU), a Resilience Fund to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport, a Sports Club Resilience Fund to support clubs, and a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund. It also includes an additional &euro;15 million to the GAA, Camogie Association and Ladies Gaelic Football Association specifically for the running of the 2020 Inter-County Championships. </p><p>The funding, which is being allocated by Sport Ireland, will address the existential threat to National Governing Bodies and their club networks, allowing sports organisations to offset significant losses incurred in recent months and add a semblance of certainty to planning for 2021.</p><p>The significant investment will reach all levels of the sport sector with National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and thousands of grassroots clubs across Ireland set to benefit. </p><p>The funding is being invested through grant schemes with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s recognised funding partners, including the National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and other funded sporting organisations.  Sport Ireland will not provide funding directly to sports clubs, affiliates, provinces or branches, this funding will be accessed through programmes established by each of the National Governing Bodies in receipt of funding. It is expected that the National Governing Bodies will publish details of funding allocated to clubs under these programmes in due course.  </p><p>Details of the funding allocations announced on Monday are available on Sport Ireland's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.sportireland.ie</font></i>. </p><p>The above schemes provide support for National Governing Bodies of sport and sports clubs that require assistance arising from COVID-19. The schemes do not apply to other groups such as marching bands. In addition, my Department has a range of initiatives that support for music, include marching bands.  For example, my Department provides funding for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians on an annual basis throughout the country.  The Scheme is managed by Music Network  on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level.  Annual funding is provided to CC&Eacute;  for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. They promote traditional music and dance in the following ways:</p><p>Thousands of children and young people develop their musical performance (instrumentation and vocal) skills and appreciation skills at these mentored weekly classes, where the emphasis is oral transmission in an appropriate context. Over 1,500 Classes are delivered weekly in community settings. Classes are not currently permitted under Level 5 restrictions.  </p><p>With over 400 branches, 18 centres, 7 Regional centres and 11 Outreach centres throughout Ireland, Britain, North America and worldwide, a wide variety of formal and informal performance opportunities are provided through the Comhaltas structures and Centres.

The purpose of this document is to mitigate against elite athletes becoming infected with COVID-19 whilst abroad and also to mitigate the risk of visiting athletes coming to Ireland with COVID-19 and transmitting the virus whilst here.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the protocol include the daily monitoring of the athlete's health prior to travel, the creation of a &ldquo;Travel Bubble&rdquo; whilst abroad, which limits the athletes&rsquo; social interaction whilst abroad, and the restriction of movement and daily monitoring of their health on return. </p>  <p>  On return to Ireland, elite athletes are expected to restrict their movements outside of sport activities for 14 days. Restrictions include prohibition on use of public transport, limitation on visitation to other households and of others to their homes. </p></reply>

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April with six new allocations approved. </p>  <p>  With regard to future rounds of the programme, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review. Work on these terms and conditions is now being finalised and an announcement in relation to the timing of the next round and the funding available will be made in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

A limited exemption is set out in the public health regulations for certain elite and professional sportpeople and sporting activities, including certain games in camogie, football and hurling.  </p><p>In this context, the Government's decision to exempt some Gaelic Games recognises the unique place that the Gaelic Games championships occupy in Irish life. However, given the current epidemiological situation with the disease, which requires the minimisation of both travel and contacts to prevent the spread of the virus, not every competition, team or grade in the sports concerned can be accommodated. </p><p>In normal circumstances, in certain competitions, counties enter teams at different ability levels, but this year, recognising that we are dealing with a global pandemic, this exemption only applies to each county fielding just one team in the All-Ireland competitions for each code &ndash; camogie, hurling, gaelic football and ladies gaelic football. This requirement means that no county team can play in two competitions nor can counties field a second team in another division or branch of an All-Ireland competition structure.  During the Level 5 restrictions, there can be no scheduled matches other than those that form part of the All-Ireland competition and there can be no practice or training matches other than between players on the panel that form part of the existing team training structure. Once teams are eliminated from the competitions they must thereafter cancel all training sessions.</p><p>The exemption approved by Government applies to a very small number of sports and is also designed to limit the number of teams that will be participating in Gaelic Games competitions. Within the confines of the available exemption, it is a matter for the national governing bodies concerned and their constituent county boards to decide on the actual teams to represent their counties in the championships.</p><p>The Government has reaffirmed to the Gaelic games associations the importance of all participating teams adhering fully to all relevant public health guidance and the return to play protocols developed earlier this year, at their matches and training sessions. </p></reply>

A fourth species, muntjac deer, has been reported from the wild on a number of occasions, but we have no evidence that this exotic and potentially invasive species is breeding in Ireland. Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts. There is an annual Open Season during which deer can be legally shot under licence. The current Open Season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  </p>  <p>  No national census of deer populations has been carried out to date. However, my Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as National Parks and the indications are that all three deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  </p>  <p>  Although not a direct measure of deer population size, the licence returns from deer hunters also provide some indication of wild deer numbers. The number of deer reported shot during the hunting season rose steadily from c10,000 in 2000 to over 30,000 in 2010 and this figure has increased again in recent seasons, to 40,000 for the first time in the 2017/2018 season. </p>  <p>  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out on State land to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  </p>  <p>  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners. My Department does not have powers to carry out any such culls.  Landowners may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p></reply>

In particular, the 2011 Regulations transpose two key pieces of EU nature legislation: the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. </p><p>Under Article 12 of the Birds Directive, Member States are required to report to the EU Commission on the implementation of national provisions taken under this Directive. In 2019, as part of this reporting obligation, Ireland submitted 209 season specific assessments, including assessments for all of Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species and a large proportion of those species&rsquo; populations that occur here during the non-breeding period. </p><p>The 209 &lsquo;species-seasons&rsquo; are comprised of:</p><p>- 142 assessments of breeding birds (including a short report on one species, Corn Bunting, that went extinct after the Birds Directive came into  force);</p><p>- 63 wintering accounts with the vast majority related to wintering waterbird populations; and</p><p>- 4 accounts of birds using Ireland&rsquo;s coastlines or offshore waters on passage (i.e. three tern species and one shearwater).</p><p>Of these 142 breeding birds, 11 species belong to a cohort known as birds of prey which includes owls, hawks, eagles and falcons.</p><p><b>Table 1</b>lists these predatory birds and their current estimated population sizes. <table>    <tr>       <th>Species</th>       <th>Estimated population size </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kestrel</td>       <td>13,500 breeding pairs <sup>T</sup></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sparrowhawk</td>       <td>11,859 breeding pairs <sup>?</sup></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Long-eared Owl</td>       <td>1,484 &ndash; 2,703 breeding pairs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Common Buzzard</td>       <td>1,938 breeding pairs* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Barn Owl</td>       <td>400 &ndash; 500 breeding pairs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Peregrine Falcon</td>       <td>425 breeding pairs* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Merlin</td>       <td>200 &ndash; 400 breeding pairs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hen Harrier</td>       <td>108-157 breeding pairs <sup>&Oslash;</sup></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Red Kite</td>       <td>63 breeding pairs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>White-tailed Eagle</td>       <td>12 breeding pairs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Golden Eagle</td>       <td>5 breeding pairs</td>    </tr> </table> <i>Notes: * minimum estimate; </i><i><sup>&Oslash;</sup></i><i>108 confirmed pairs and 49 possible pairs; </i><i><sup>T</sup></i><i>9,918 - 17,393 pairs 95% CI; and </i><i><sup>?</sup></i><i>8,476 &ndash; 14,252 pairs 95% CI.</i></p><p>Due to human persecution and other drivers, including land-use and habitat changes (e.g. loss of native forest cover and wetland drainage), a number of raptor species became extinct as a breeding species in Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These include the Golden Eagle (in 1912), the White-tailed Eagle (early 20th C.) and the Red Kite became extinct as breeding species in Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From the early 21st century, these species have been subject to re-introduction programmes which have seen the species re-establish a foothold once again.  Current population estimates (based on numbers of breeding pairs) are detailed in Table.  </p><p>The Hen Harrier population has been monitored in recent decades through national surveys with the fourth and most recent survey completed in 2015. The short-term trend 2005-2015, indicates a decline of 9.7% in the national population. Changes in land-use caused by the intensification of agriculture and afforestation are considered to be the most important drivers among others of this population.</p><p>Farmers in Hen Harrier areas (SPAs and areas identified in the national 2015 survey) are eligible for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine's agri-environmental schemes known as GLAS and GLAS+. DAFM has estimated that more than &euro;23m per annum is available for Hen Harrier actions alone in GLAS and GLAS+. As of August 2019, some 2,617 farmers had taken up these measures in GLAS and 1,506 in GLAS+. </p><p>Since 2017, the Hen Harrier Project supported by DAFM under the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) measure of the RDP was launched with a budget of &euro;25 million. Its main objectives include the sustainable management of farmland in the Hen Harrier SPAs, with a strong socio-economic focus in these marginal agricultural areas, and fostering good relations through locally-led solutions between farmers, state bodies and other stakeholders.  The project incentivises farmers to manage their land in ways that will improve habitat condition for the benefit of Hen Harrier. </p><p>Approximately 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species assessed are estimated to have remained stable or increased in abundance over the long-term. This cohort includes those relatively recent colonists with strong population growth including Little Egret, Great Skua, Mediterranean Gull, Little Ringed Plover, Bearded Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker. However these recent additions to Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird community need to be viewed in the context that almost 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species, for which we have data, are considered to be in long term decline. </p><p>Some of our breeding farmland songbirds have been flagged in recent decades as being particularly vulnerable to the modernisation and intensification of agricultural practices. This ongoing change in agricultural practices has led to the extinction of Corn Bunting as a breeding bird in Ireland and has been a primary driver of long term declines in species such as Corncrake, Yellowhammer, Whinchat and Twite for example. The latter two species&rsquo; estimated populations are now considered to be both less than 100 pairs. </p><p>Countryside Bird Survey data for two ground nesting songbird species which are still relatively abundant and widespread, namely Meadow Pipit and Skylark, were used for this reporting round. Their preferred breeding habitats include peatlands and unimproved grasslands, and both populations are in decline with the estimated short term abundance of Meadow Pipit declining by over 12% and for Skylark by almost 11%. Over the last 40 years or so the estimated breeding range of the latter has decreased by almost one quarter. Such estimated declines are of particular concern as both Meadow Pipit and Skylark make up significant proportions of the prey base of some of Ireland&rsquo;s raptors of conservation concern including Merlin, Kestrel and Hen Harrier. The short term declines for the latter two raptors are estimated to be circa 28% and 10% respectively. </p><p>Breeding waders as a group continue to suffer significant declines in both population and breeding range, in both the short- and long-term. Species such as Curlew, Lapwing, Redshank and Dunlin, all of which nest on the ground, have declined by 93% or more in the long term. Certain breeding duck populations are also of concern with numbers of breeding Common Scoter continuing to decline to critically low levels. While this species&rsquo; range is stable, the population has declined 21-54% in the short-term and 61% in the long-term. The latest assessment of breeding Red-breasted Merganser (which was reproduced from the 2008-2012 reporting period due to a lack of contemporary data) estimates that this breeding population has declined 62% in the short-term.</p><p>The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding seabird species&rsquo; long term population trends are now reckoned to be either stable or increasing. It is possible that the increased level of breeding seabird survey effort undertaken by my department over recent year may be partially responsible for some of these recorded gains. Kittiwake stands out among the seabird cohort where there is now a strong evidence base to conclude that the population is under a sustained and significant decline. Further work on understanding the drivers of this decline is required but indications that a lack of available forage fish may play a role.</p><p>Of particular note are the very strong population increases with several of our breeding tern species (e.g. Roseate Tern, Sandwich Tern, Little Tern and Common Tern). At the site level it is evident that targeted conservation measures in the form of wardened tern colonies is resulting in direct and effective conservation positives.  However several of these particular species&rsquo; estimated long-term breeding range trends are in decline or stagnant which not only reinforces the need for such conservation management interventions but also clearly sets out the on-going obligation that such conservation initiatives are to be maintained or where necessary improved. </p><p>Robust and contemporary population estimates have been produced for approximately 85% of our breeding seabird species. Work is on-going in my Department with further surveys targeting seabirds such as Puffin, Manx Shearwater and Storm Petrel. These species whose colonies are located on offshore islands are particularly vulnerable to invasive mammals. Such survey work is needed to provide context and further targeting of the on-going bio-security conservation measures currently being carried out by my Department.</p><p>The vast majority of those wintering populations assessed as part of the Article 12 Reporting process relate to wintering waterbirds. This group includes ducks, geese, swans and waders among others. Due to its geographical location, climate and wetland habitats, Ireland is an important host for hundreds of thousands of visiting waterbirds during the non-breeding/wintering seasons. Due to the relative sizes of their respective biogeographic populations, Ireland is of international importance for several waterbird species including Whooper Swan, Greenland White-fronted Goose, Brent Goose, and Black-tailed Godwit among others. The population trends for wintering birds varies by group and species. Wintering wader populations, for example, are largely showing continued population declines. While the trends for geese vary, with Greenland White-fronted Geese showing a continued recent decline, and others such as the Barnacle goose showing a positive long term trend. </p><p>A range of conservation measures have been put in place in an attempt to halt and reverse population declines for those most threatened bird species. The following examples are targeted at particular bird species but are likely have positive benefits for other species and habitats. </p><p>A new project, &quot;Crex LIFE&quot; has been established that will aim to reverse the declines in Corncrake populations, following on from the NPWS Corncrake scheme. The NPWS Curlew Conservation Programme continues to bolster conservation efforts for threatened breeding Curlew, with teams undertaking habitat management and community engagement in core areas. Further innovations for Curlew conservation are being developed by the DAFM-funded Curlew EIP. </p><p>The NPWS farm plans put in place conservation measures on priority farmland areas to benefit breeding waders, Chough, threatened passerines such as Whinchat, and various wintering geese and swans. NPWS also liaise with DAFM for the design and targeting of more widespread national agri-environment measures on farmland, which includes measures for: Curlew; breeding waders more generally; wintering geese and swans; threatened passerines such as Twite; Grey Partridge; Hen Harrier; and Twite. NPWS also run a Grey Partridge conservation programme based primarily at Boora, Co. Offaly, which also delivers benefits for breeding Lapwing and other ground-nesting birds such as Skylark. NPWS also implements measures for the rare breeding species Red-throated Diver. </p></reply>

There was some suggestion of declines in the survey results of 1990/91 and 2004/05 but the most recent survey (2010/11) indicated recovery to 1980 levels. </p><p>The most recent distribution data show that the otter continues to be widespread throughout Ireland in a wide variety of habitat types. Otters have two basic requirements: aquatic prey and safe refuges where they can rest. In Ireland, otter populations are found along rivers, lakes and coasts, where fish and other prey are abundant, and where the bank-side habitat offers plenty of cover. </p><p>A total of 44 Special Areas of Conservation have been designated with  the otter as a qualifying interest. These comprise extensive stretches of river channels and coastline (including off-shore islands) as well as lakes and blanket bog systems. The main threats to the otter include pollution, particularly organic pollution resulting in fish kills, the removal of riparian vegetation, and accidental deaths (road traffic and fishing gear). The otter population (estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000 breeding females) is considered to be stable or increasing and none of the threats or pressures identified is considered to be impacting on the species at a population level. The overall status of otter is considered to be favourable.</p><p>The report from the last national otter survey can be downloaded here: </p><p>In 2019, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of my Department, co-funded a survey across the island of Ireland on the distribution and status of the native Red Squirrel. The survey also examined the distribution of the native Pine Marten and the invasive Grey Squirrel. The Grey Squirrel was introduced to Ireland just over 100 years ago and competes with the Red Squirrel for resources. It also carries a disease that is fatal to the native species. As a result, the spread of Grey Squirrel in the second half of the 20th Century was mirrored by a retraction in Red Squirrel range and a reduction in numbers. In recent surveys, however, it became apparent that in some parts of Ireland there had been a change in the fortunes of the two species. </p><p>In surveys conducted in 2007 and 2012 it was evident that the Grey Squirrel had disappeared from parts of the midlands of Ireland. This disappearance was linked in subsequent studies to the re-emergence of the Pine Marten, a native Irish carnivore. The Pine Marten had previously almost disappeared but has made a considerable recovery after becoming protected under Irish and EU legislation. High densities of Pine Marten were found in the midlands of Ireland, in the areas where Grey Squirrel had disappeared. Meanwhile, Red Squirrel had made a recovery in some of these areas and seemed capable of co-habiting woodlands with the native carnivore. </p><p>The 2019 survey sought to update the distribution maps for the three species in recognition of the rapidly changing situation and I am pleased to say that the results are very encouraging. Red Squirrel sightings have increased considerably, particularly in Ulster and Leinster, and it has returned to many parts of the midlands from which it had disappeared. The most marked increases in Red Squirrel sightings were in Co. Westmeath, Co. Offaly and Co. Laois, the areas from which the Grey Squirrel has disappeared from longest. The midlands gap in Red Squirrel distribution recorded in previous surveys has retracted, however it is still rare in much of Co. Meath, Co. Louth and Co. Dublin. Meanwhile the grey squirrel has continued to decline and is absent now from large areas of the midlands. Full details of the survey results, including the up to date map of the red squirrel&rsquo;s distribution, can be found in the online report here: </p><p>Of further note is the recent revision of the All-Ireland Red Data List of Mammals. The 2009 version of the List had included Red Squirrel as &ldquo;Near Threatened&rdquo; due to concerns about its decline and the threat posed by the grey squirrel. The updated Red List from 2019 now lists red squirrel as &ldquo;Least Concern&rdquo; in recognition of its improved status.</p><p>The 2019 All-Ireland Red Data List of Mammals can be downloaded here: </p></reply>

The draft NMPF is Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive marine spatial plan document and outlines the clear structure and direction proposed for the development, conservation and enjoyment of our maritime area. This important new text will, when finalised, stand as the marine equivalent of the terrestrial National Planning Framework and will become the key decision-making tool for regulatory authorities and policy makers into the future. The draft NMPF, as well as other associated reports, are available for viewing on my Department's website via the following link: . </p><p>My Department is now finalising the draft NMPF based on the evaluation of public consultation submissions received. The final NMPF will be prepared for submission to Government and presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year.

They are also required to establish a national strategy for Government in relation to the strategic planning and sustainable development in the maritime area, utilising an ecosystem based approach, which is required for the purpose of supporting proper planning and sustainable development in the maritime area. Furthermore, the plan must encourage the colocation of relevant activities and developments in the maritime area.</p><p>The will coalesce the requirements made in the Planning and Development Amendment Act (Amended) 2018 to further support the final NMPF.</p><p>It is my understanding that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently reviewing policy relating to LNG and as this work is pending, it is not included in the current iteration of the NMPF; however, this will be kept under review by my Department and included in subsequent iterations of the NMPF when developed. The regulation of LNG policy, including floating regasification storage units, will remain a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Communications and Climate.</p></reply>

The Act also provides for permanently enhanced protections which were designed to ensure that tenants and landlords engage to address any rent arrears arising at the earliest juncture. </p><p>In rent arrears cases, a landlord is required to engage early by serving both the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and the tenant with a 28-day warning notice seeking payment of rent arrears. Upon receipt of the warning notice, the RTB acknowledges receipt to the landlord and the tenant and provides information to the tenant to enable them to get advice from the Money and Budgeting Advice Service (MABS) and offers assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy. </p><p>Any subsequent notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if the associated rent arrears warning notice had not been served on both the RTB and the tenant. The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.</p><p>The tailored approach in the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 targets a temporary prohibition on rent increases to those who can least afford it. It protects tenants from imminent tenancy termination caused by rent arrears. The Act balances the need to protect those worst affected by Covid-19 with the need to respect property rights and the legitimate interests of landlords.</p><p>The temporary enhancements to tenancy protections under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 provides that where a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021. </p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021):</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further information available at - ); or</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance);</p><p>and</p><p>- at risk of losing their tenancy,</p><p>can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021. </p><p>In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the Residential Tenancies Boards (RTB) website - , if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord. </p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>Many Government Departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Social Protection (D/SP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Social Welfare Allowances are available to assist them.</p><p>The D/SP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears. Further information on these supports can be found by calling the D/SP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the D/SP website at: </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case. </p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on .</p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords.</p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - - and on the RTB's website - .</p><p>The RTB has engaged with stakeholders with regard to the recent tenancy protection enhancements and launched advertising campaigns, including on social media, informing the public and directing people to its website for more information. The advertising campaigns ran from 15 April until to 1 August 2020 and the final phase of a related mail-shot to tenants and landlords concluded last week.</p><p>On 24 October 2020, the Residential Tenancies  Act 2020  was enacted and came into operation to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the efforts of Government in restricting the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of Covid 19. The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. The current restriction to 5 km is due to expire on 1 December 2020. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 operates independently of, and complements, the provisions of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. </p><p>At this time, a landlord can serve a warning notice  seeking payment of rent arrears and, if required, can serve a follow-up notice termination. Where the tenant has made the required declaration, the enhanced protections under the Residential Tenancies and Vaulation Act 2020 apply and the tenancy cannot be terminated until 11 January 2021. A landlord can refer a dispute to the RTB where he or she contests the applicability of enhanced protections under the Residential Tenancies and Vaulation Act 2020. </p><p>A tenant is obliged under section 16(c) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to allow, at reasonable intervals, the landlord, or any person or person acting on the landlord's behalf, access to the dwelling (on a date and time agreed in advance with the tenant) for the purposes of inspecting the dwelling.  A breach of this tenant obligation can also be referred to the RTB. A landlord may report anti-social behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for appropriate action.</p></reply>

Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021. </p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021):</p><p>in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further information available at - ); or</p><p>in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance);</p><p>and</p><p>at risk of losing their tenancy,</p><p>can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021.</p><p>In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the Residential Tenancies Boards (RTB) website - , if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy.</p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords.</p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - - and on the RTB's website - .</p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Many Government Departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Social Protection (D/SP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Social Welfare Allowances are available to assist them.  Further information on these supports can be found by calling the D/SP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the D/SP website at: .</p><p>With Government funding, Threshold, the national housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service. Further information is available on .  The homeless and housing sections in local authorities continue to assist those who are not in a position to provide accommodation for themselves.</p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on .</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 targets enhanced protections to the most vulnerable tenants until 10 January 2021 and respects the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords. I have no plans to introduce a blanket ban on rent increases.</p></reply>

Consequently, I may not seek to influence the outcome of, or comment on, any individual planning cases.</p>  <p>  The planning system remains fully operational during the current Level 5 restrictions. My Department issued a Planning Circular on this matter - PL09/2020 and an accompanying Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document on 23 October 2020 regarding the operation of the Planning system during the current Level 5 restrictions.</p>  <p>  For the purpose of giving legal effect to the Level 5 restrictions announced by the Government, new Regulations have been made by the Minister for Health entitled the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 448 of 2020) which will continue in operation until 1 December 2020. These Regulations define an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; as a service specified in Part 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations which includes Class 14 relating to Public Administration, Emergency Services and Defence, within which the planning system is explicitly classified as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo;:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;(y) statutory planning system activities, insofar they cannot be carried out remotely".</p>  <p>  This classification therefore enables planning authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la staff to travel to and from their offices as may be required for the performance of their statutory functions. It also enables such staff to perform related statutory functions including site visits and inspections as well as enforcement activity subject to public health and social distancing requirements.</p>  <p>  In addition, for the purpose of facilitating continued public participation in the planning process during the Level 5 restrictions, Regulation 5(2) of the above Regulations further explicitly provides that attendance at a planning office is a valid reason for travelling in order to -</p>  <p>  &ldquo;(y) attend the offices of a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to engage in a statutory planning process (including making or inspecting a planning application or appeal, making an observation or submission or participating in a Development Plan process) or inspect a site notice (within the meaning of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (No. 30 of 2000)).&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted in this context that planning authorities are required under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 38) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 180 of 2020) to upload planning applications and related documentation onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt or, where exceptional circumstances exist, as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>  <p>  These measures enable members of the public to view documentation online and at planning offices and facilitates planning applications, appeals or other submissions to be made during the Level 5 restrictions. These arrangements may include provision for attendance by appointment so that public health and social distancing requirements can be observed by both staff and customers.</p>  <p>  With regard to judicial reviews of points of law in relation to planning decisions, provision already exists under Section 50(8) of the Act for the High Court to grant an extension to the period for leave to apply for judicial review where there is sufficient reason to do so, and the circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application for leave within the period so provided were outside the control of the applicant for the extension.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the ongoing situation with regard to Covid-19 and may introduce measures as appropriate, if required.</p></reply>

A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.

These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF).</p>  <p>  The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public.</p>  <p>  This year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country will benefit from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes. In addition a further &euro;1m was announced recently for built heritage projects under the Government's July Jobs Stimulus Package. The funding will supplement 28 projects already approved under the BHIS and HSF, as well as 13 new projects categorised as urgent built heritage works.</p>  <p>  Both schemes could potentially provide support for the restoration of eligible derelict and traditional cottages and houses.  Applications for funding under the 2021 schemes will open later this month and full details will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on each local authority&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently preparing a three-year strategy for vernacular houses and other structures which is intended to address various issues, including dereliction. With appropriate advice and support frameworks, such structures could be rehabilitated as viable places to live in. It is hoped that the various actions proposed in the strategy will also help to reinforce a sense of place, community and local pride. My Department will be working closely with local authorities and other bodies to ensure the actions are implemented.</p></reply>

In fact the numbers of fire service frontline staff have been maintained at a high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were by necessity being reduced in other areas.</p>  <p>  Local authorities as the employers of fire service personnel, and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) engage with appropriate staffing representative bodies in relation to overall terms of employment etc.  I understand that this is the case at the moment in respect of staffing matters in Dublin Fire Brigade. Given the statutory roles I have outlined above and the fact that discussions in relation to the Dublin Fire Service are ongoing between the relevant parties in the appropriate fora, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister, to make any comment on the issue at this time.</p></reply>

This entails the use of promotional posters, social media and the taking out of both newspaper and on-line advertisements. This campaign takes place each year between 1<sup></sup>November and 25<sup></sup>November and was recently launched for the 2021 register. The social media element is a coordinated, pro-active online campaign that seeks to engage various sectors and audiences, encouraging people to check their voter details on the register of electors. My Department has also undertaken initiatives to encourage other segments of the population to exercise their right to vote. For example, in advance of the local and European Elections in 2019, my Department worked with the Immigrant Council of Ireland in a publicity campaign aimed at providing information and encouraging immigrants to register to vote.</p><p>In the case of referendums, the role of any Referendum Commission established for a particular referendum includes the promotion of public awareness of the referendum and the encouragement of the electorate to vote at the poll.</p><p>Looking to the future, the Programme for Government - <i>Our Shared Future</i>- commits to the establishment of an Electoral Commission. It is intended that the new Commission will have a public awareness and education role in respect of electoral events, and will be tasked with the development of means to increase participation in our political processes. The Programme for Government commits to the Electoral Commission being in place by the end of 2021 and my Department is currently preparing the General Scheme of an Electoral Reform Bill in order to progress this initiative.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to the modernisation of the electoral register. While the current electoral registration system has served the country well, it is clear that modernisation will bring significant benefits, in particular by making the process more streamlined and accessible through optional online registration. As part of this wider modernisation initiative, one of the proposals being considered is provision for the pre-registration of 16 and 17 year-olds. This pre-registration would then become automatically active on a person&rsquo;s 18<sup>th</sup>birthday. This proposal would also provide opportunities, such as the development of a schools programme, for young people to engage with the electoral register thereby improving the chances of their engagement post-18 when they become eligible to vote.</p></reply>

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic. There is no blanket ban on applications or drawdowns for RIHL applicants.</p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) or its successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the TWSS scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  This approach also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is now operational, where a decline of at least 30% in future turnover is projected for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 for a participating business.  </p>  <p>  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.</p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.</p></reply>

GSI have found that the rate of drainage during dry periods has been consistent since monitoring and the problem is that the drainage rate, in general, is  unusually slow for a turlough its size.</p><p>While most turloughs empty each summer, Funshinagh is slow to drain, typically every 4-5 years. It is evident that Funshinagh does not get a chance to &lsquo;reset&rsquo; its flood pattern each year. As a consequence, Funshinagh has not drained since before the 2016 flood and is still impacted by this flood. This issue has been further exacerbated by the heavy rainfall in February of this year. </p><p>Attempts were made on behalf of the local authority in 2016, to unblock a swallow hole but this did not appear to have an impact on drainage. The GSI has concluded that  this is likely because the issue related to the aquifer itself which cannot transmit the water any faster, particularly when saturated. GSI note that the water travels underground for at least 5km before emerging at a spring and altering the natural drainage network itself is not a viable option.</p><p>In response to concerns that landowners are  unable to continue to farm the land due to the continuous flooding,  NPWS commissioned a study, clearly flagged as without prejudice, <i>'To assess the current situation where flooded land is now deemed as non-eligible for payments under current EU payment schemes on the farmers&rsquo;</i>.</p><p>NPWS worked closely with the Local Authority GIS Unit and  local farmers throughout the study. The study found that most of the flooding is outside the designated area.</p><p>The NPWS Farm Plan Scheme is a small scheme nationally, designed to trial conservation management measures  at a local scale and would not be the appropriate measure to address this problem which is recurring and not strictly a  nature conservation or management issue. NPWS is not in a position to  develop Farm Plans to pay farmers for flooded areas where they are unable to farm as this would be ultra vires the scheme.</p></reply>

During this period, in 2018, the National Planning Framework (the NPF) was published and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given the superseding of the NSS by the National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, together with the need to address the potential implications of the 2013 European Court of Justice ruling in the "Flemish Decree" case, there is now merit in updating the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines in a broader rural development and settlement context.  My Department has commenced scoping this work and I expect a draft by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.</p></reply>

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, it was estimated that local authorities would collect &euro;1.66 billion in rates in 2020 from approximately 150,000 commercial and industrial properties liable for payment, amounting to 29% of their overall projected revenue for 2020.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was passed by the Oireachtas and enacted on 11 July 2019.  Key Elements of the Act include:</p>  <p>  A modernisation of rates legislation and practice, including variation of rates payment      arrangements;</p>  <p>  The pro-rata levying of rates on occupiers based on period in occupation within a year; </p>  <p>  The application of interest payments on unpaid rates; </p>  <p>  Minimum charges for vacant commercial premises;</p>  <p>  Potential Rates Waiver Scheme; and</p>  <p>  Amendment to Rate Limitation Order formula in place in the year following revaluation.</p>  <p>  These new provisions will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and ratepayers.  Commencement of the various sections of the Act is under active consideration, and it had been intended that the bulk of the provisions would be operational for the 2021 local authority budget cycle, in November 2020.  However, commencement has been delayed due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  In recognising the difficulties faced by businesses, the Programme for Government &ndash; &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;, in the area of &ldquo;Reigniting and Renewing the Economy,&rdquo; committed to set out how commercial rates will be treated for the remainder of 2020.  One of my earliest priorities as Minister was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while simultaneously supporting local authorities.</p>  <p>  &euro;600m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of a six-month waiver of rates from 27 March to 27 September, which took the form of a credit in lieu of rates.  To strengthen this support, in Budget 2021, the Government announced an extension of the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m.  The criteria for the extended waiver remains the same and it is intended that the waiver for the final quarter will be automatically applied to rate accounts that benefitted from the six-month waiver.  This brings to  &euro;900m the financial support to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates, which is an unprecedented measure that offers support to businesses and certainty to local authorities.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government, on the subject of Local Government committed to examine ways to further streamline the commercial rates system post COVID-19.  Consideration will be given to the area of commercial rates when there is greater certainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The issue will be reviewed in the context of the importance of commercial rates to the local government sector and the impact of commercial rates on business, whilst bearing in mind the recently enacted legislation and continuing impact on businesses and the reopening of society.</p></reply>

The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence.</p><p>This Act operates in parallel with the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 which came into effect from 1 August 2020 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy. </p><p>If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - www.housing.gov.ie - and on the RTB's website - .</p><p>The RTB has engaged with stakeholders with regard to the recent tenancy protection enhancements and launched advertising campaigns, including on social media, informing the public and directing people to its website for more information. The advertising campaigns ran from 15 April until to 1 August 2020 and the final phase of a related mail-shot to tenants and landlords concluded last week.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 provides for permanent enhancements to tenancy protections that require a landlord to copy the RTB with any written rent arrears warning notice given to a tenant seeking the payment of all rent arrears within 28 days. The RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. If the tenant agrees, the RTB can help them to engage with MABS to resolve their rent arrears and sustain their tenancy.  <b></b></p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Social Protection (D/SP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Supplementary Welfare Allowances are available to assist them. </p><p>The DEASP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears.</p><p>Further information on these supports can be found by calling the D/SP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the D/SP website at:</p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on . </p><p>Given the State income supports and assistance available, including those available for tenants in arrears, and informed by the evidence provided by research into this area, it would not be appropriate to establish a debt forgiveness scheme, as proposed by Threshold, to write-off rents payable in the residential rental sector which plays an important role in providing accommodation for many. State supports include the Rent Supplement, Supplementary Welfare Allowances and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) schemes and the Help-to-Buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to assist renters to buy their own home.</p></reply>

Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of these funding arrangements with my Department.  </p><p>Exchequer funding for homeless services is provided through my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis.

Section 19 of those Acts provides that in setting a rent under a tenancy of a dwelling, the rental amount shall not exceed market rent. In a Rent Pressure Zone, a rent increase restriction of 4% per annum applies. </p><p>My Department and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on<i></i>.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies  Act 2020  was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020 to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the efforts of Government in restricting the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of Covid 19. The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence.</p><p>This Act operates in parallel with the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 which came into effect from 1 August 2020 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy. </p><p>If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021. </p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021): in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further informationavailable at - ); or in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance); and at risk of losing their tenancy, can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021. </p><p>In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the RTB website , if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 provides for permanent enhancements to tenancy protections that require a landlord to copy the RTB with any written rent arrears warning notice given to a tenant seeking the payment of all rent arrears within 28 days. The RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. If the tenant agrees, the RTB can help them to engage with MABS to resolve their rent arrears and sustain their tenancy.  <b></b></p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website and on the RTB's website<i></i>.</p><p>The RTB has engaged with stakeholders with regard to the recent tenancy protection enhancements and launched advertising campaigns, including on social media, informing the public and directing people to its website for more information. The advertising campaigns ran from 15 April until to 1 August 2020 and the final phase of a related mail-shot to tenants and landlords concluded last week.</p><p>Many Government Departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Social Protection (D/SP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Social Welfare Allowances are available to assist them.  Further information on these supports can be found by calling the D/SP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the D/SP website at: </p><p>With Government funding, Threshold, the national housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the maximum limits that apply to their administrative areas. My Department does not monitor how each individual authority sets their income limit as the income limit is set by Regulation and not by local authorities.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the income limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

I am not, therefore, in a position to comment or make a statement on any individual planning case. </p>  <p>  Generally, when making a decision on a planning application that is subject to appeal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned and the potential effects on the environment of the proposed development, having regard to a range of matters specified in legislation, including the provisions of the relevant development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any statutory guidelines and specific planning policy requirements under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  Under the Planning Act, the Board may, in determining an appeal, and in the case of Strategic Infrastructure Development applications made directly to the Board, decide to grant permission even if the proposed development would contravene materially the development plan of the relevant planning authority. </p>  <p>  In cases on appeal, where a planning authority has refused an application for planning permission for a proposed development because it would contravene materially the local development plan, the Board may, under the provisions of the Planning Act, grant planning permission for proposed development that materially contravenes the development plan in the following circumstances:- Where the Board considers that: the proposed development is of strategic or national importance; there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the proposed development is concerned, or permission should be granted having regard to the regional spatial and economic strategy for the area, statutory guidelines, statutory policy directives, the statutory obligations of any local authority in the area, and any relevant policy of the Government or any Minister of the Government; or permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the pattern of development, and permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.</p>  <p>   Similar provisions also apply to applications for Strategic Housing Development (SHD), which are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where 100 or more residential units are proposed.</p>  <p>The Urban Development and Building Heights Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published by my Department in 2018, also address this issue.  Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) 3(A) of the Building Height Guidelines provides that where an applicant for planning permission sets out how a development proposal complies with the relevant criteria and the assessment of the planning authority concurs, taking account of the wider strategic and national policy parameters, then the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may approve such development, even where specific objectives of the relevant development plan or local area plan may indicate otherwise.  </p>  <p>  In order to better align decision making processes between local authority development plans and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of overall Government policy, the Building Height Guidelines require planning authorities to identify through their statutory plans, areas for increased building height, where appropriate, and to not provide for blanket numerical limitations on height (SPPR1).  This work is underway as part of statutory planning processes in many local authority areas.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework is endorsed in the current Programme for Government, which also includes a commitment towards a &lsquo;town centre first&rsquo; principle, in support of more balanced regional and rural development.</p>  <p>  Rather than introduce new or increased requirements, both the NPF and the Programme for Government underpin pre-existing requirements for residential density.  The National Planning Framework restates the commitment to implement statutory planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, published by my Department in 2009.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas generally require densities in the range of 35-50 dwellings per hectare (dph) on outer suburban/greenfield sites.  The Guidelines also provide scope for densities below 35 dph on more peripheral sites in smaller towns and villages, in particular to assist in delivering more sustainable alternatives to dispersed rural housing.  These requirements have been established Government policy for a significant period of time, dating back to the late 1990&rsquo;s.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to have ongoing engagement with the Local Authority sector, including individual local authorities, on a wide range of policy issues, including those relating to planning, which may from time-to-time include residential density.  However, as policy on this issue is long established, the focus of engagement with local authorities is on the broad implementation of national policy and not on individual developments or development proposals.</p>  <p>  It is noted in particular, that the assessment of individual planning applications is carried out on a case-by-case basis by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, having regard to planning guidance and other relevant factors.  Section 30 of the Planning Act precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la may be concerned.</p></reply>

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  </p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) or its successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the TWSS scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  This approach also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is now operational, where a decline of at least 30% in future turnover is projected for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 for a participating business.  </p>  <p>  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.</p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.</p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advice for travel to these countries is now to &lsquo;exercise a high degree of caution&rsquo;. Our general advice for any other overseas travel remains &lsquo;avoid non-essential travel&rsquo; or in some cases, &lsquo;do not travel&rsquo;. Any decision to travel to, stay in or leave a country is a responsibility of individual citizens and the Department is not in a position to deem individual trips to be essential or non-essential. Our detailed guidance is intended to help citizens make informed decisions for themselves when planning a trip overseas. </p><p>I can advise that, under the provisions of the EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo quarantine while exercising their essential functions. These essential functions include:</p><p>-Workers or self-employed persons exercising critical occupations including health care workers, frontier and posted workers as well as seasonal workers as referred to in the Guidelines concerning the exercise of free movement of workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>-Transport workers or transport service providers, including drivers of freight vehicles carrying goods</p><p>-Patients travelling for imperative medical reasons</p><p>-Pupils, students and trainees who travel abroad on a daily basis.</p><p>-Persons travelling for imperative family or business reasons</p><p>-Diplomats, staff of international organisations, military personnel and police officers, humanitarian aid workers and civil protection personnel carrying out their duties.</p><p>-Passengers in transit</p><p>-Seafarers</p><p>-Journalists when performing their duties.</p><p>Any person who wants to travel to other EU countries including France and Spain should inform themselves about any requirements in place in the destination to which they are travelling to. Testing restrictions may be imposed or may already be in place in other countries. Information on these restrictions is available on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dfa.ie/travel/travel-advice/</i>and the new <i>reopen.europa.eu</i>website.</p></reply>

An Agreement in this framework is the best way to provide for a comprehensive future partnership between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting of 15 and 16 October, leaders had a discussion on the state of play in the Brexit talks and agreed Conclusions.  As part of those Conclusions, leaders called for Member States, the EU Institutions and stakeholders to step up their work on readiness and preparedness for all possible outcomes.  The Conclusions also invite the European Commission to give timely consideration to unilateral and time-limited contingency measures that are in the EU&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Brexit Readiness Action Plan, a number of unilateral, time-limited contingency measures were adopted at EU level in 2019 with a view to mitigating the worst impacts of a possible no-deal UK withdrawal from the EU.  The conclusion and entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement means that many of these measures did not apply.</p>  <p>  Under the EU Treaties, it is the European Commission that proposes legislation for consideration, as relevant, by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.  The Commission has therefore been invited by leaders to prepare for the possibility that further contingency legislation will be required at EU level should agreement not be reached between the EU and the UK on a comprehensive future partnership before the end of the Brexit transition period.  Government officials are in close contact with the European Commission on the matter.  Any contingency measures adopted at EU level can be expected to be limited in scope and will not maintain the status quo.  </p></reply>

I reaffirmed that position directly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland once again at our last meeting on 8 October in Hillsborough.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has committed to take a decision on whether to order a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane by the end of November. The Government will continue to engage with the UK Government on this issue at this critical juncture, and I am due to meet remotely with the Finucane family tomorrow to discuss their case and to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s support. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers in September expressed their deep concern that a decision has still not been made by UK authorities on how to respond to the 2019 UK Supreme Court judgment with respect to the case of Pat Finucane.  The next meeting of the Committee is to take place in December, and the UK Government&rsquo;s decision is awaited by the Committee.</p>  <p>  The Finucane family, like so many other families, have waited for far too long, and have had to campaign determinedly for decades in their pursuit of truth and justice. This underlines the clear need for the implementation of the framework agreed in Stormont House in 2014 to address the legacy of the past comprehensively and fairly, and in a way that responds to the needs of all victims and survivors, and indeed society as a whole. </p></reply>

The country has been beset with a combination of both climate and natural disasters as well as continued human rights and poverty challenges for decades. The global coronavirus pandemic is further straining an already fragile social and health infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Since 2018, Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian funding to Sudan. This is channeled through trusted partners including UN Agencies and international NGOs, which has enabled us to respond with the highest priority projects being implemented by the best placed responders including in some instances by local Sudanese NGOs which work with our international partners. </p>  <p>  The funds are allocated by our partners to different sectors based on the needs of the people affected the most including health, water and sanitation, shelter, protection, food and nutrition, education and support to build back livelihoods after a crisis. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, Ireland has also provided over &euro;5.6 million in longer-term development funding to Sudan, channeled through trusted international NGO partners, to support sectors including livelihoods, health, nutrition, water and sanitation. Our international NGO partners often work with local partners within these sectors.</p>  <p>  In addition to our direct contribution to development, human rights and humanitarian relief in Sudan, since 2018, Ireland has contributed &euro;32 million to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a pool of stand-by funding available for rapid response by UN Agencies for support to humanitarian action wherever needs arise.  This year, Sudan has been the top recipient of funds from the CERF and since 2018 has received &euro;137.5 million from the Fund to support critical life-saving humanitarian needs.  Other relevant humanitarian instruments to which Ireland contributes include the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), which has committed over &euro;61 million to humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year and &euro;580 million since 2011 for life-saving assistance to people in Sudan. Sudan also benefits from funding under the EU Trust Fund for Africa, to which Ireland is a contributor. </p>  <p>  As well as our humanitarian and development support, Ireland is a strong supporter of Sudan&rsquo;s ongoing democratic transition and the civilian-led transitional Government. Minister Coveney T.D., then T&aacute;naiste, warmly welcomed the power sharing agreement reached in August 2019 and met with Sudan&rsquo;s civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok on the margins of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels in November 2019.   </p>  <p>  In June 2020, then Minister of State, Ciar&aacute;n Cannon T.D. represented Ireland at the high level Sudan Partnership Conference hosted by Germany and the EU. He reaffirmed Ireland&rsquo;s support for Sudan&rsquo;s transitional Government and announced funding of US$500,000 to the World Bank Trust Fund for Sudan, for the Government&rsquo;s flagship Family Support Programme, to support vulnerable families with cash transfers. Ireland was proud to be an early contributor to this important mechanism. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with our EU partners to ensure a strong and unified Team Europe response in support of Sudan, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which has significantly impacted Sudan. My officials continue to monitor developments in Sudan, including through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Nairobi, and in cooperation with the EU Delegation in Khartoum, and are looking at additional supports before the end of 2020. </p></reply>

Due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the OSCE and the EU suspended election observation missions until last month. </p>  <p>  In respect of forthcoming elections this month and next, in Ukraine, Georgia and Republic of Moldova, the OSCE has advised that it will organise limited election observation missions which do not require volunteer observers. </p>  <p>  As outlined in response to Parliamentary Questions No. 396 of 6 October and No. 158 of 15 October, the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken the decision not to nominate volunteers for election observation missions at this time due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and in the context of the current travel advice for Irish citizens and residents.  This advice is to avoid non-essential overseas travel due to the potential for exposure to COVID-19 and the risk this poses both for the individual and for the wider community. </p>  <p>  The nature of election observation missions is such that the chance of exposure is higher still, given that such missions entail not only travel to the destination country but extensive travel within the destination country, and the probability of close contact with residents as well as other election observers coming from other countries with varying COVID-19 incidence rates. As well as potential exposure of Irish election observers to infection, and the implications for their families and communities on return, we must also be mindful of the risk of election observers themselves exposing others to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  As we are well aware here in Ireland, having moved to Level 5 measures, the pandemic has not abated and our main priority must remain the health of volunteers and their wider circles of contact, both at home and abroad. We look forward to a return to nominating volunteers for election observation missions when conditions allow. In this respect, Department of Foreign Affairs officials are monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis and, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, will continue to evaluate as they arise any calls for election observers from the OSCE and EU. This includes taking into account overall public health and official travel advice; the COVID-19 situation both in destination countries and here in Ireland; communications with EU and OSCE focal points for election observation missions; and safeguards put in place both by mission organisers as well as host countries.</p></reply>

Armed men in military-style attire attacked a group of protesters in the Lekki area of Lagos, using live ammunition, resulting in at least 12 deaths and many people injured. </p>  <p>  I extend my deep condolences to those bereaved and wish a speedy recovery to those injured.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with the European Union, believes that it is essential that the events of 20 October are thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are held to account.  This echoes the calls by UN Secretary General and the African Union for a speedy investigation and for an end to reported police brutality and abuses.</p>  <p>  The protests, which took place in a number of cities including Abuja and Lagos, were in reaction to allegations of excessive use of force and abuses committed by a unit of the Nigerian police, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit.  While the protests were largely peaceful, they came against a background of unrest, including reports of jailbreaks and looting.  </p>  <p>  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced on 12 October that the SARS police unit would be disbanded, one of the main requests made by protesters. However, it was perceived that the unit would continue under another name and the protests persisted, leading to violence of 20 October, as well as wider calls for reform and an end to police violence and corruption. The Nigerian army denies involvement in the 20 October shootings. </p>  <p>  President Buhari gave an Address to the Nation on 22 October, setting set out a number of steps his Government intends to take, including: the establishment of judicial panels of inquiry; the establishment of human rights complaint mechanisms; and the establishment of a fund for the compensation of victims. I look forward to the timely implementation of these potentially significant steps, which have helped calm the situation.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja continues to actively monitor developments actively on the ground and, working closely with our EU partners, to engage with the Nigerian authorities. </p></reply>

It is of particular concern that levels of violence against those supporting the implementation of the 2016 Peace Agreement, including through the programme for voluntary crop substitution, appear to have increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia.</p><p>I understand that the person, details supplied, who was murdered on 3 October 2020 in Cauca was active in advocating for the right of farmers to have access to supports for voluntary crop substitution programmes.  His death, along with the recent death of a colleague of his, is yet another loss to Colombian civil society which continues to work towards full implementation of the Peace Agreement. Cauca is one of a number of Departments in Colombia where the activity of illegal armed groups has increased during the pandemic, with levels of violence also increasing as the groups battle for territorial control. Ireland supports the condemnations of these attacks and the calls for the perpetrators to be brought swiftly to justice. </p><p>Colombia has made great progress in strengthening peace and stability in recent years, following signature of the Peace Agreement, ending over 50 years of armed conflict. It is clear, however, that significant challenges remain in a number of areas, including rural reform, the reintegration of former combatants, human rights and the strengthening of protections for human rights defenders and social leaders.</p><p>I firmly believe that an improved human rights situation in the country is linked to the full implementation of the peace accords. Ireland is a longstanding and committed supporter of the peace process in Colombia, having contributed over &euro;16 million in funding since 2007, mainly channeled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on human rights, conflict prevention, peace-building and supporting livelihoods for rural populations.</p><p>As well as financial support, Ireland has also provided ongoing support in the form of lesson-sharing based on our own experience of peace-building and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. We also participate in the EU&rsquo;s ongoing campaign to recognise and champion the work of human rights defenders in the country.</p><p>I reiterated Ireland's support for the peace process in recent engagements with the Colombian Government, including a meeting with the then-Minister for Foreign Affairs Carlos Holmes Trujillo during his visit to Dublin last year, and in my contacts with his successor, Minister Claudia Blum, earlier this year.</p><p>Our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging with local civil society and EU and UN partners on the human rights situation in the country since it opened last year and advocates for ongoing and increased protection of human rights leaders. The Embassy regularly raises these issues and the status of the peace process in exchanges with the Colombian administration and government.</p><p>The Colombian Government continues to affirm its commitment to the full implementation of the peace agreement, and has expressed its appreciation for Ireland's support in this area, as well as the important role played by former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process. </p><p>In July this year, Mr Gilmore led the 12th session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, raising the high levels of attacks and murders of human rights defenders, and the need for collective protection measures.</p><p>Officials in my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia, as Ireland continues to support Colombia in its transition to a stable, peaceful, post-conflict society.</p></reply>

This approach, known as the traffic light system, will bring greater consistency and transparency across the European Union as we fight against the COVID-19 virus. On 20 October, the Government decided on the approach to implementing this system in Ireland. It was decided that:</p><p>-  From the morning of 22 October, travellers from green regions can enter the State without being requested to restrict their movements or undergo testing for Covid-19;</p><p>-  For now, travellers from orange, red or grey regions will continue to be requested to restrict their movements for 14 days, with the exception of certain exempted categories which will apply from 8 November;</p><p>-  It is planned that, also with effect from 8 November, travellers arriving from orange regions will be able to waive the requirement to restrict movements if they have one negative test result up to three days before arrival. The test must be conducted by an authorised entity;</p><p>The new approach is now reflected in travel advice published by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Ireland&rsquo;s security status for all countries in the EU plus area is now assigned as &ldquo;High Degree of Caution&rdquo;. All other countries remain at &ldquo;Avoid Non-Essential Travel&rdquo; or &lsquo;Do not Travel&rsquo;.</p><p>The new coordinated approach to travel restrictions was developed specifically to safeguard freedom of movement within the EU and facilitate travel between EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, once passengers arrive in a State, they are expected to follow the relevant public health measures in place in that State. This means that any person arriving into Ireland must abide by the current public health measures in place. This includes abiding by the current restrictions under Level 5 of the National Framework for Living with COVID-19, where everyone is asked to restrict movements to within 5 km of their home or place of residence unless it is strictly essential.</p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders, including by the then Taoiseach during his St. Patrick's Day visit to the White House in March, and more recently by the Taoiseach in high level calls to members of the US Administration. I have also raised immigration issues in recent contacts with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney, with the US Ambassador, as well as with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress during my visit to Washington D.C. at the end of September.</p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide support and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work.</p>  <p>  In 2019, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 88 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, and in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. Over the past five months, Minister Brophy and I have met virtually with many of these organisations and heard first-hand of the challenges faced by our diaspora communities, and the valuable support these organisations are providing.</p>  <p>  While comprehensive immigration reform is a complex and sensitive political issue in the US at present, our Embassy and network of Consulates General will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 Visa Bill which is currently before the US Senate, having been passed in the House of Representatives. It was reintroduced by Congressmen Neal and Sensenbrenner in May 2019, having failed to gain Senate approval the previous year. If passed, this could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. While the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the congressional agenda, we hope that when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate.  We will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p></reply>

I regret that none of the three recent ceasefires have been honoured and am troubled by continuing reports of hostilities in populated areas, which are having a devastating impact on local civilian populations. </p><p>Ireland has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the negotiating table, and we welcome and support the statements of the European Council and the OSCE Minsk Co-Chairs calling for this. </p><p>The alleged use of Cluster Munitions in any situation is deeply concerning. They pose unacceptably high risks to civilians, especially when used in populated areas. Furthermore, any indiscriminate use of, or impacts from, cluster munitions would be in contravention of International Humanitarian Law to which both Armenia and Azerbaijan must abide.</p><p>Ireland urges both sides to de-escalate tensions by refraining from inflammatory rhetoric and strictly observing the latest ceasefire. Ireland fully supports the Minsk Process and we thank both the High Representative and the Co-Chairs Group for their efforts to de-escalate tensions over recent months.</p><p>We will continue to monitor this evolving situation closely.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in actions across our development cooperation programme as well as in our broader engagement with the EU, UN and other international bodies. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s work complements many decades of support by Irish missionaries, NGOs, and contributions by individual Irish citizens. In line with this strong tradition, I was very pleased to note the appointment this month of Professor Gerard Quinn as the UN rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities. </p><p>Ireland formally ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in March 2018. The convention seeks to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.</p><p>The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is composed of 18 members and elections are held every two years to appoint nine members for a four year term. Elections to the CRPD are decided by secret ballot and it is our practice not to disclose publicly how we vote in such elections.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our vote will reflect our general approach to ensuring that membership of Human Rights Treaty Bodies should be broad based, inclusive, with committee members appointed on merit, and reflecting our commitment towards achieving gender equality at all levels. </p><p>In this regard, Ireland&rsquo;s vote will take particular account of the following criteria: the need to achieve an improved gender balance; equitable representation from the various geographic regions including low and middle income countries; and finally to ensuring that the Committee includes members who bring expert and preferably their own &ldquo;living experience&rdquo; across diverse areas of disability. </p><p>In the meantime my Department will continue its efforts to promote and protect the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.</p></reply>

Like many others,  I have made clear my dismay at these remarks and have expressed my full solidarity with President Macron and the French people. My concerns have been made known through official channels to the Turkish Government. </p>  <p>  These latest comments are unfortunately part of a wider trend of provocative acts by Turkey, which need to cease if we are to relaunch the EU-Turkey relationship. The comments are particularly disappointing as they come just a matter of weeks after the European Council on 1-2 October offered to launch a positive political EU-Turkey agenda if Turkey continued to take constructive efforts to stop illegal activities in relation to Greece and Cyprus.  </p>  <p>  Ireland would like to see a more stable and constructive relationship developed with Turkey, particularly given the importance of the EU-Turkey relationship to issues such as migration,  security and the economy. This would benefit both the EU and Turkey. However, this very much depends on Turkish attitude. If we are to get beyond the current difficulties, Turkey urgently needs to actively engage in finding solutions to current tensions and refrain from negative and provocative behaviour.</p></reply>

The UN is warning that the country is on the brink of famine. Yemen faces outbreaks of violent conflict, flooding, displacement, cholera and restrictions on humanitarian access. Currently COVID 19 is spreading rapidly in the country.</p>  <p>  In both 2019 and 2020 Ireland provided &euro;5 million in funding to the United Nations Yemen Humanitarian Fund. This Fund mobilises and channels funding to NGOs and UN agencies which have the capacity and are best placed to deliver lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable. In total, Ireland has contributed over &euro;27 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding at the global level, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland is among the top ten contributors to the CERF since its establishment in 2006. In 2019, the CERF provided &euro;32 million in funding to Yemen. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since the conflict started in 2015, the EU has allocated &euro;484 million in humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call for full, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian and health workers and supplies to all parts of Yemen, in line with Security Council Resolution 2532. This would ensure the safety of essential services and allow lifesaving assistance to reach those in greatest need.</p>  <p>  Along with the UN and the EU, Ireland believes that the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. We urge all parties to the conflict to engage with him without pre-conditions, to enact confidence-building measures to secure a sustainable peace, and to allow the people of Yemen to begin to rebuild their lives.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, the award of Distinguished Service Medals (DSM) and Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) are provided for in Defence Forces Regulations (DFR) A9.  This regulation also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.  It is important that in order to maintain the standing of such medals and indeed all of those provided for in DFR A9, that the criteria outlined is strictly adhered to.</p>  <p>  The introduction of any change to the regulations or to the criteria for the award of DSMs or MMGs is not a straightforward matter and has many associated complexities.  Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising such as maintaining the integrity of the award of medals system and implications for previous decisions of properly constituted medals boards.   The availability of documentary evidence and official records also presents a challenge in this case.  It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered. At this juncture, no new information has come to light that would be cause for the matter to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the issue is receiving further consideration. The Chief of Staff is currently considering the matter, in the context of the award of medals, and the possible implications for the integrity of the award of medals system.  The Secretary General of my Department has also recently met with Comdt Leo Quinlan (retired) on the matter.</p></reply>

This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, the award of Distinguished Service Medals (DSM) and Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) are provided for in Defence Forces Regulations (DFR) A9.  This regulation also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.  It is important that in order to maintain the standing of such medals and indeed all of those provided for in DFR A9, that the criteria outlined is strictly adhered to.</p>  <p>  The introduction of any change to the regulations or to the criteria for the award of DSMs or MMGs is not a straightforward matter and has many associated complexities.  Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising such as maintaining the integrity of the award of medals system and implications for previous decisions of properly constituted medals boards.   The availability of documentary evidence and official records also presents a challenge in this case.  It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered. At this juncture, no new information has come to light that would be cause for the matter to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the issue is receiving further consideration. The Chief of Staff is currently considering the matter, in the context of the award of medals, and the possible implications for the integrity of the award of medals system.  The Secretary General of my Department recently met with Comdt Leo Quinlan (retired) on the matter.</p>  <p>  A response will issue to Kilkenny County Council and the other local authorities on their motions shortly.</p></reply>

No decisions have made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;265 million, including VAT, is currently committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  </p><p>Along with other equipment capability requirements, the acquisition, renewal and retention of equipment capabilities is being pursued under the Defence Forces Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020.  This sets out current priorities and plans taking account of available resources and in line with the policy approach in the White Paper on Defence.  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action in the present EDP.Much of this longer range lift capability is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.</p><p>The table below provides the amounts paid for the UNDOF and UNIFIL troop rotations for the years 2017-2019.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year </b></th>       <th><b>Contingent</b></th>       <th><b>Cost </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>UNDOF</td>       <td><div>&euro;185,350 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>UNIFIL </td>       <td><div>&euro;372,470 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>UNDOF </td>       <td><div>&euro;224,000 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>UNIFIL </td>       <td><div>&euro;388,075 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>UNDOF </td>       <td><div>&euro;181,000 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>UNIFIL</td>       <td><div>&euro;509,400 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In 2019, the Department complied with the guidelines with the exception of five contracts (in excess of &euro;25,000) totalling &euro;161,297 (excluding VAT) relating to various services contracts, which were extended beyond their original contract terms. Each of these five contracts have been reviewed by the Department, and steps are being taken to bring each of these contracts into compliance with competitive procurement rules as quickly as possible.</p><p>The Department has provided details of these exceptional contracts as part of the 89 contracts with a total value &euro;19,679,110. (excluding VAT) that are included on the annual return in respect of Circular 40/2002 to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The 84 remaining contracts, with a value of &euro;19,517,813 (excluding VAT), are considered compliant, as the justification for awarding these contracts falls within the exceptions to a competitive process permitted in national and EU legislation.  </p><p>The main exceptions applied by the Department and Defence Forces are set out in the Defence and Security Directive 2009/81/EC.  The Defence and Security Directive recognises the specific characteristics of defence and security procurement, its complexity and sensitivities, in particular security of supply and security of information considerations.  Those considerations are also contained in Article 346 of the Treaty of the European Union.  </p><p>An example of a legitimate circumstance whereby the Department or Defence Forces may award a contract on a non-competitive basis occurs is when the original equipment manufacturer is deemed the only suitable supplier.

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers. </p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks. Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and the UK, on an as available basis. In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions. The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24/7 transport service. This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis. This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose. However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed. </p>  <p>  The level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for non-scheduled inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced in recent years in respect of night time hours.  As has been acknowledged, recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces are resulting in operational challenges primarily across the Naval Service and Air Corps. A range of actions have been taken to date to address these recruitment and retention issues and further actions are currently being progressed.  These steps are enhancing capacity in the Air Corps with a view to a return to previous levels of capability. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Air Corps continues to provide support for emergency inter-hospital transfers on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis, having regard to available capabilities and its primary security responsibilities.  To date in 2020, the Air Corps completed a total of 45 inter-hospital missions utilising aircraft from the entire fleet, 31 of which were to the UK, including one priority transfer.  Five-missions were outside of the agreed Service Level Agreement whereby the Air Corps provided the requested air transport of patients to or from mainland Europe.  Over 20% of all emergency inter-hospital support occurred at the weekend.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  The Defence Forces has provided a wide range of supports to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force including the deployment of personnel to support the HSE in the area of contact tracing.  </p><p>Most recently, Cadets and personnel from the Defence Forces School of Music have been deployed to support the HSE with contact tracing efforts.  At the present time, a number of personnel from the Defence Forces School of Music are assisting the HSE in the area of contact tracing.  </p><p>Other supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE include:</p><p>-  operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>-  transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>-  collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>-  support for HSE testing efforts including through the deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>-  PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>-  provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>-  transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>-  assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>-  production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>-  the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p>In addition to support the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.  Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force and examples include:  </p><p>-  Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports and Covid 19 testing supports.</p><p>-  Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>-  Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p><p>With regard to the Reserve Defence Forces role in the fight against Covid 19 crisis some members of the RDF, who have skills which are required in the COVID 19 response, have been engaged in authorised COVID 19 activities in support of the PDF, on a voluntary basis and where their personal circumstances allow. </p></reply>

L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n (P51) was commissioned in 1999, with L&Eacute; Niamh (P52) commissioned in 2001.  The service life of an Irish Naval Service ship is determined by the level of operational activity, but usually is around 30 years.  It is, however, normal practice in a ship&rsquo;s life to carry out a Mid-Life Extension Programme so as to extend the useful life of a ship to thirty (or more) years. </p>  <p>  The P50 class vessels, 21 and 19 years old this year, now fall into the category of ship requiring a mid-life extension programme.  Due to their age profile, much of the auxiliary equipment onboard is coming to the end of its useful life or is becoming obsolete and requires to be replaced in a structured manner.   </p>  <p>  The Mid-Life Extension Programme of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n commenced in March 2019, with an initial dry-docking phase followed by an extended period of equipment upgrade and refit works. Works are progressing more slowly than planned due to the impact of COVID restrictions, however, the works are scheduled to be completed in early 2021. Once L&Eacute; R&oacute;isin returns to full operational status, L&Eacute; Niamh will be withdrawn from operations and the Mid-Life Extension Programme of works on L&Eacute; Niamh will then commence. The works programme for L&Eacute; Niamh is expected to follow similar upgrades and refit works as L&Eacute; R&oacute;isin.</p></reply>

All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way  to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review have been drafted and a Steering Group has been established. </p>  <p>  Given the current evolving situation with Covid-19 and the continued restrictions the work of the Steering Group has been delayed. It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme; examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.  </p></reply>

The process of national standardisation was then applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate results from any one year are considered equivalent to the results from any other year. This is because the results each year are subject to a process of national standardisation through the marking processes undertaken by the State Examinations Commission.  This year, the national standardisation process combines the school-sourced data and certain historical data to ensure the Calculated Grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a national standard.  </p>  <p>  The standardisation process used a range of data sets, including:</p>  <p>  - The estimated percentage marks and class ranking of students supplied by schools to the Calculated Grades Executive Office</p>  <p>  - Junior Cycle Exam performance of the class of 2020 in each school, to be used at a group level rather than an individual level</p>  <p>  - Historical national Leaving Certificate results data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 with student-level linkages to the corresponding Junior Certificate results data of those student cohorts and</p>  <p>  - Historical national distribution of student results on a subject-by-subject basis</p>  <p>  On 1 September, I announced details in relation to the Calculated Grades model following approval of proposals made to Government. The change proposed removed the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model. I was conscious that the use of such data had been criticised in public commentary about calculated grades and that it had led in other jurisdictions to accusations that students attending disadvantaged schools in those jurisdictions were at risk of being treated unfairly. The change made placed a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. </p>  <p>  Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the Calculated Grades results are available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>  On 3 October, It was announced that a comprehensive independent review of the design and implementation of the Calculated Grades process would take place when the process is complete.  </p>  <p>  The independent comprehensive review will consider key aspects of the system of Calculated Grades. This will include: the initial decision to adopt the calculated grades model; whether the process met its objectives; how effective the process was; how that process worked in terms of design and implementation; and how effective were the governance and oversight procedures. The review will also include what lessons can be learned for the future.  </p>  <p>  The full scope of the review will be clearly set out in advance.  It would not be appropriate to commit at this time as to what will and will not be published following the review. </p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  The system of calculated grades is underpinned by key principles of objectivity, equity and fairness.  The process has been designed to arrive at fair representations of student performance which does not favour any type of student or school. </p>  <p>  Circular 0037/2020, which was published on 21 May, set out the detailed guidance for schools on the operation of the calculated grades process. The document provided detailed information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades.  Additional guidance to schools on the avoidance of unconscious bias and interpreting evidence of achievement in the case of students with disabilities was issued to schools on 28 May. </p>  <p>  In line with the guidance, teachers were asked to use their professional judgement to arrive at an estimated mark for each student. The guidance required teachers to utilise a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework.</p>  <p>  The same guidance also advised schools that where any reasonable accommodation had been approved for any student, (such as a reader, scribe or waiver), the estimate of the student&rsquo;s likely performance was to be based on the assumption that this accommodation would have been available had the examinations been conducted in the normal way. </p>  <p>  Since accommodations are intended to reflect students&rsquo; normal way of working in class, this would not have required any special intervention beyond the teacher&rsquo;s existing understanding of how the student gets on with the relevant supports in place.</p>  <p>  Therefore, a student&rsquo;s access to any reasonable accommodation is also reflected in the final Calculated Grade awarded to the students. </p>  <p>  In the context of the November examinations, if candidates were approved reasonable accommodation(s) for the June examinations, they will have access to this resource in November.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November.  </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p></reply>

This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.  </p>  <p>  The initial Identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETB) identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.</p>  <p>  My Department officials have been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process.

A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 Community National Schools.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources (teachers) provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location. For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.  In DEIS schools, the staffing schedule operates at a more preferential allocation ratio.</p>  <p>  This year the Department and the Primary Appeals Board are very cognisant of the impact of COVID-19 on schools and in that context has looked carefully at all decisions on the allocation of teaching posts where schools have reduced enrolments to ensure that all decisions are reasonable and all schools are treated fairly.</p>  <p>  A blanket freeze on the normal arrangements for allocations for one cohort of schools could disadvantage all other schools of similar size, who may have lost teachers in recent years. It is an important feature of the staffing schedule that all schools are treated equally and fairly.</p>  <p>  Each school setting is different in terms of physical layout, available space, student numbers and staffing; schools themselves are best placed to decide on the necessary changes/reconfigurations to maintain physical distancing. The Department has been working closely with those schools who are experiencing particular difficulty in implementing and maintaining physical distancing arrangements in classrooms.</p></reply>

While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only. Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical  schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1. </p>  <p>  The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.  My Department continues to support those schools most in need and I intend to engage with the relevant stakeholders as to how best to achieve this.  </p></reply>

The SNA on restricted movement must arrange a COVID-19 test as soon as possible and remains available for work during this period.

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport and who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. </p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that the child to whom the Deputy refers is not attending her nearest post primary school and is therefore not eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received from the family in question on 9th September 2020 and as such is late.</p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

The pilot scheme had 6 base schools employing teachers in a fixed term basis so as to provide substitute cover to up to 90 schools.</p>  <p>  In July, my Department of Education published the report to Government &ldquo;Reopening Our Schools, The Roadmap for the Full Return to School&rdquo; and announced a funding package of more than &euro;370 million for schools to support its implementation. </p>  <p>  Among the package of supports is the extension of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panel.  Additional teachers are being provided to support the safe and sustainable reopening of primary schools in order to provide enhanced substitution and eliminate the need to mix classes when a teacher is absent. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are 115 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide and when full recruitment has taken place there will be over 300 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed.  These substitute Supply Panels are not the sole means whereby schools source substitutes but are set up to work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers whether through a school&rsquo;s own panel of regular substitutes or the National Substitution portal service as outlined in the Department Circular 45/2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Supply Panel mentioned by the Deputy, it should be noted that the recruitment of the teachers on the panel was not completed and did not operate fully until the end of September. It is a condition of the supply panels that all Base-Schools will report to my Department in relation to the utilisation and efficiency of their Supply Panels. The Teacher Supply panels operate on a first-come first-served basis with all schools assigned to the Supply Panel having equal access to teachers on the panel and can book those teachers if available by using the &lsquo;app&rsquo; in use by the panel. There a number of &lsquo;apps&rsquo; in use by panels generally which lead to greater efficiencies in utilisation of teachers on the panel. Schools can clearly see from such &lsquo;apps&rsquo; the availability teachers and can plan accordingly in advance.</p></reply>

The provision of funding will support schools in updating and renewing their ICT infrastructure and assist schools to embed innovative and cutting edge technologies to enhance teaching, learning and assessment in their schools. In the context of the current public health crisis schools can use this funding to address ICT needs including the purchase of devices, software, networking equipment and other ICT solutions.  This may include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with learners who do not have access to devices and for the purchase of essential learning platforms.

Schools are advised that where they plan to introduce such digital technology, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised.

It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including hardware such as table devices, software and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information. </p>  <p>  All purchasing undertaken by schools of exchequer provided funding must be in compliance with Public Procurement Procedures.

Funding for previous segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into schools and overall funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools. A new model for allocating Special Education Teachers in mainstream schools provides a single allocation for special educational supports based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. The model establishes a school&rsquo;s educational profile, which includes traveller children, enrolled in a school under the following strands: </p><p>- The number of students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>- The social context of school which at primary level, one component includes the number of traveller pupils and at post primary schools, is based on the number of pupils who had exam fee exemptions, including Traveller pupils.</p><p>- Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results which includes schools with pupils from the Traveller community who may be attaining lower standardised test scores. </p><p>The Department currently spends &euro;1.9b, or over 20% of its total educational budget annually, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. Schools are provided with additional pupil capitation for Travellers at a current cost of &euro;1.2 million. </p><p>In addition, investment of some &euro;125 million is provided by the Department's DEIS Programme for educational inclusion providing for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS.  Traveller pupils are also included for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on Bullying sets out a comprehensive approach to tackling all forms of bullying, including <i>identity based bullying</i>, and to promoting positive, inclusive environments in all schools.  Actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including identity based bullying, are addressed.The procedures acknowledge that while bullying can happen to any pupil, it is known that some may be more vulnerable to or at risk of experiencing bullying including Traveller and ROMA children. The Department, in consultation with Traveller representative groups, has commissioned research  on the experiences of  Traveller and ROMA children in schools  and the effectiveness of the Departments anti-bullying procedures.  Three field workers have been recruited from Traveller and ROMA communities to assist with the research.  The final report is expected before the end of this year.</p><p>My Department is committed to improving educational outcomes for Traveller and ROMA children through the implementation of the education actions of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). NTRIS takes a whole of Government approach to improving the lives of Travellers and Roma in Ireland in practical and tangible ways. Departments have worked together to identify actions that can be taken to bring about a real improvement in the quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It also aims to improve public service engagement with Traveller and Roma communities. </p><p>The most significant issue for Traveller and Roma children in the education system is that of school attendance, retention and participation. Responding to specific actions in the NTRIS and the DEIS Plan, a Two Year Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention/school completion has been established in four specific Traveller and ROMA Communities (Ballymun/Finglas/Coolock; Tuam, Co. Galway; Enniscorthy/Bunclody, Wexford and Cork City) . Partners in the project along with this Department include Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and Traveller and ROMA representatives. Each pilot area is being provided with an additional Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) and Home School Liaison Coordinator (HSCL) and two additional Traveller/ROMA Education Workers. It is intended that the pilot will inform future policy in the area of Traveller and ROMA education.</p></reply>

This is available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool </p>  <p>  The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme has been expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that notwithstanding the range of measures put in place, some schools have experienced challenges and my Department has continued to engaged with and support schools where they have demonstrated particular difficulties in accordance with circular 45/2020.</p>  <p>  The HSE Department of Public Health has in place prioritised testing for those close contacts of a confirmed case within the school community.

These tests have a specific school reference number to allow batch reporting of results for the particular school setting. This ensures fast turnaround times for testing and enables swift onward further public health actions if required. </p></reply>

Pupils need no longer experience delays in receiving reports which could, in the past, deny a child access to necessary learning supports. </p>  <p>  Schools may allocate additional teaching support to pupils where it has identified learning needs using school based assessment or the Continuum of Support and the Guidelines provided to schools. Schools can also draw on professional reports where available.</p>  <p>  Medical and other professional assessments may continue to be used to help explain, and provide a better understanding of a child&rsquo;s needs, the nature of difficulties, and to inform relevant interventions. They are not however, a requirement for the provision of additional teaching support.</p>  <p>  A new model for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools is also being developed. This model will not require children to have a diagnosis of a particular disability in order to access services and assessments for individual children were not required to be submitted for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  The criteria for accessing Reasonable Accommodations at State Exams and Irish Exemptions are also now needs based and not requiring assessment of disability.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education is also currently preparing policy advice in relation to the provision of special school and special class placements and this policy advice is expected to be finalised by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can advise the Deputy that significant additional supports are also provided to schools under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme, which provides additional supports to disadvantaged schools. Pupils attending these schools are not required to have an assessment of need in order to access supports under this scheme.</p></reply>

Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Previous budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of 1 teacher to 26 pupils. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  I was delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that  less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the 2019/20 school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and class sizes.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year there are 887 schools in the DEIS Programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population.  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. The approach is grounded in international evidence and it is considered that it is the combination of the various interventions under DEIS that have enabled it to succeed.  </p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan acknowledges that over their lifetime children may experience many transitions as they progress along their education journey. In DEIS schools, strong transfer programmes and targeted engagement with parents from groups with a traditionally low level of engagement with education are key to achieving successful transitions. DEIS supports such as the Home School Community Liaison scheme and the School Completion Programme assist students and their families as they transition between settings on their educational pathway.</p>  <p>  Well-being supports are provided by my Department throughout the school support structure &ndash; the Continuum of Support. This support structure allows all schools to provide universal support for all students, using preventative, early intervention and strong universal approaches to support well-being and encourage successful transitions.  The Continuum of Support framework also recognises that some students - those groups who are at risk or who have emerging needs - will require more targeted support,  while others who have complex and enduring needs will require an individualised approach to support, taking a developmental perspective, and adapted to the individual needs of the student.</p>  <p>  The Education Passport, as developed by the NCCA, also assists schools in the provision of information on pupils as they transition from primary to post primary including any additional needs they may have. </p></reply>

This number excludes students who initially entered for an appeal but later withdrew their application. </p>  <p>  As a result of the process, a total of 18 increased grades have been awarded to 18 individual students.  Eleven of these were upgrades following an appeal by the student. A further seven grades were upgraded following quality assurance checks as part of the appeals process which involved checks on the documentation submitted by schools; the entry of that data on to the schools' data collection system; and the subsequent transmission of the data through the various IT systems used in the generation of calculated grades. </p>  <p>  The appeals process was a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.  It was not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school was outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process was also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  The CAO were also notified of changes to students&rsquo; results on 16 October. Candidates who are eligible for a new offer as a result of the upgraded mark received following the appeals process will be contacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.</p>  <p>  The closing date for application to this process was 5 p.m. on Friday 23 October. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  Students were also given the opportunity to register for the postponed Leaving Certificate examinations which are due to begin on 16 November.</p></reply>

Once the PHRA is complete the Department of Public Health will then advise the school of the public health instructions which then should be followed by the school. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s advice to schools is to follow public health advice at all times. This practice ensures that no principal, or teachers is burdened with the responsibility of making a public health decision in relation to the closure or otherwise of schools. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health in recent days has advised my Department that this issue has been afforded careful consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). In recommending that schools remain open at the present time, even in the current trajectory of the disease, the NPHET has considered the national experience of school reopening to date, including the epidemiological data and information gathered through case and outbreak management. </p>  <p>  The experience of public health to date is that transmission rates of Covid-19 in schools are low, much lower than the rate currently in the community. This is a result of the effectiveness of the public health guidelines for schools and the successful implementation and adherence of all in the school community to the guidelines. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>School Transport services for the 2020/2021 school year commenced on the 26th August 2020.  All children who are eligible for school transport and who applied and paid by the deadline have been accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p><p>Based on the public health advice published in early July, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7 August and from NPHET on the 18 August, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, using 50 per cent of passenger capacity. The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks and over the coming weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on all remaining routes.  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets. </p><p>With regard to the review of the School Transport Scheme, in October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the scheme with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way  to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review have been drafted and a Steering Group has been established. </p><p>Given the current evolving situation with Covid-19 and the continued restrictions the work of the Steering Group has been delayed. It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. </p><p>The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme;<i></i>examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.  </p></reply>

While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only. Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical  schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1.  </p>  <p>  The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, </i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education </i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. </i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i></i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p><p>The www.gov.ie/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  </p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.  </p></reply>

There are two school planning areas most relevant to the Deputy&rsquo;s query: Scribblestown-Finglas West and Finglas East-BallymunD11.</p>  <p>   Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  In order to best assist parents, my Department has developed an Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) and this provides objective information to parents and guardians which allows them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction i.e. Irish or English of the new school. </p>  <p>  Previous demographic exercises indicated a need for two new primary schools to serve the Scribblestown_FinglasWest school planning area and following the appropriate patronage processes Pelletstown ETNS opened under the patronage of Educate Together in 2015 and Scoil Sin&eacute;ad opened in 2017 under the patronage of Scoil Sin&eacute;ad.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools nationwide, including in Scribblestown_FinglasWest and in FinglasEast_BallymunD11 will be kept under on-going review and patronage processes will be run in respect of any new schools that are to be established to meet a demographic need.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process provides an opportunity to increase the number of multi-denominational schools nationwide.  The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-denominational schools in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community. The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration Process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Schools Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the provision of PE Halls form part of the accommodation brief for all newly established schools.  These facilities may also form part of the overall accommodation brief for major capital extensions to existing schools.  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.  The second half of the NDP (from 2023 onwards) will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p></reply>

The employee in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group should take extra care to practice social distancing and hand hygiene.  The use of face coverings and personal protective equipment may also be considered where maintaining social distancing is difficult.  </p><p>All schools are required to have a School COVID-19 Response Plan in place.  The plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees.Those deemed &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;normal risk&rsquo; can attend the workplace safely where the school is implementing the COVID-19 Response Plan and the health advice for schools. There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan with the individual employee and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place for the protection of employees in the school. In addition, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre recently issued advice in respect of SNAs, which sets out clearly how a safe working environment can be maintained for SNAs in schools - &lsquo;<i>Guidance for Schools regarding Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) supporting children and young people with additional care needs in the context of COVID-19'</i>. </p><p>Every school has at least 1 Lead Worker Representative whose role is to represent staff and who may consult with, and make representations to, school management on any issue of concern in relation to COVID-19, including issues relating to at risk groups.</p><p>My Department has an enhanced Occupational Health Service in place to provide employers with occupational health advice in relation to special needs assistants&rsquo; fitness for work.  The OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance. </p><p>A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the employee to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  An employee is categorised by the OHS into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, higher risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  </p><p>Where an employee considers the OHS COVID-19 risk categorisation places him/her in an incorrect risk category, a review can be requested by the employee where the OHS will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The employee may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process.</p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie </p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, may receive additional teaching support in schools.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new admission policies which are transparent and easily accessible, and have been approved by the school patron. These new policies apply to the intake group for the 2021/2022 school year and thereafter, and greatly assist parents, regardless of their background or circumstances to engage in the admission processes of individual schools.</p>  <p>  These new school admission policies set out the school&rsquo;s selection criteria in a transparent manner for parents. Schools and their patrons have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p></reply>

The approach is grounded in international evidence and it is considered that it is the combination of the various interventions under DEIS that have enabled it to succeed.  Recent endorsements for the approach include a 2018 OECD Report (&ldquo;Equity in Education &ndash; breaking down barriers to social mobility&rdquo;) which showed that educationally disadvantaged students do much better in schools where they are a minority, thereby demonstrating the importance of focusing support on concentrated numbers of students from areas of significant socio-economic disadvantage.</p><p>In the 2020/21 academic year there are 887 schools in the DEIS Programme serving over 185,000 pupils - 689 Primary and 198 Post Primary.</p><p>The total Department spend on DEIS per annum is over &euro;125 million. Additional funding is provided from Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the School Meals Programme and from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for the School Completion Programme.  </p><p>Responding to specific actions in the NTRIS and in DEIS Plan, a Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention/school completion for Traveller and Roma pupils is established in four areas. Each area is allocated 4 additional staffing resources who are working together with parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to remove the barriers impacting on Traveller and Roma children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in education. </p><p>The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5 million in 2022 provides for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.  My Department continues to support those schools most in need and I intend to engage with the relevant stakeholders as to how best to achieve this.</p><p>The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for Government. The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. My Department will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget next year on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. The main supports this funding will provide for in 2021 are:<blockquote><ul type="disc"><li>Over 18,000 SNAs will be available for allocation to schools</li><li>13,765 special education teachers for allocation to mainstream primary and post primary schools</li><li>an additional 235 special class teachers </li></ul></blockquote>My Department has consulted with educational stakeholders on the approach to supporting wellbeing and the National Education Psychological Service (NEPS) is providing a range of supports in the context of the new public health arrangements in schools.  These supports include:<blockquote><ul type="disc"><li>a webpage (gov.ie/backtoschool) with access to all information relating to the reopening of schools, including information about wellbeing, with links to specific resources, guidance and support</li><li>Wellbeing Webinars for primary/special/post-primary schools - supporting wellbeing as schools return for first term</li><li>Wellbeing Toolkits for Teachers with a range of easily downloadable, user-friendly materials</li><li>Enhanced services for wellbeing provided by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), to include the wellbeing of all of our special school communities</li></ul></blockquote>Funding necessary for 120 additional guidance teacher posts and 17 NEPS psychologist posts under the Roadmap for the Re-opening of Schools has also been secured.</p></reply>

However, I recognise that despite the best efforts of all stakeholders, there will be situations where individual pupils or groups of pupils, teachers, or possibly entire school communities, are requested by Public Health HSE to self-isolate or restrict their movements because of a case or cases of Covid-19. </p><p>Schools are aware of the need to provide for continuity of schooling in those situations. The approach may involve the use of digital technology or other means such as hardcopy materials depending on the context of the school and the school community. Given the often rapid changes of requirements and various potential scenarios that living with Covid-19 entails, it is important that schools review and adapt their plans to address the eolving situation and as their experience of providing for continuity of learning increases. This is particularly important in the context of pupils with special educational needs, pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and pupils at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning as the need arises and this guidance is all available at  </p><p> </p><p>The guidance includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools.  </p><p>My Department is also finalising a circular that will  provide guidance and support to schools to put in place arrangements, building on the work already done by schools, to facilitate communication with and between staff, between staff and learners and to facilitate development of online approaches to remote and blended learning in the event that such is required.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is also supporting school communities to provide effectively for the learning and progression of all learners during the first term of the 2020/21 school year.</p><p>In addition, as part of the implementation of the <i>Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 -</i><i>Enhancing Teaching, Learning and Assessment,</i>my Department has already provided &euro;160m of grant aid to schools for ICT Infrastructure. This includes &euro;50m that issued earlier this year.  This ICT Grant funding issues directly to schools and schools are best placed to identify the requirements of their own student cohort and to meet those requirements in the most appropriate way. In the context of the current public health crisis this funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs including devices, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning.  This can include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning.  An additional &euro;50m will issue for the current school year and it is planned that the funding will issue before the end of this year.</p><p>The situation we find ourselves in is evolving all the time.  My Department, in working with the whole of Government, will keep the situation under review and update any advices to schools as required. We will continue to work with all our stakeholders to ensure that schools, teachers and learners are supported and that together we continue to provide the best education for all our pupils/students while learning to live with restrictions under Covid-19.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;16.9 million in 2019 to all of these schools.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need.  </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1 million provided under Budget 2020 was allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.   The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.  Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.

As part of the Calculated Grades process, schools were asked to provide estimated percentage marks for language subjects based on the assumption that the oral examination component would have proceeded and would have been marked in the normal manner.</p>  <p>  Teachers are best placed to make a balanced judgement about what the candidate&rsquo;s overall performance and grade across all aspects of the subject, including orals, would have been.

The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks and over the coming weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on all remaining routes.  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation is achieved as quickly as possible on all post-primary services.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education have put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses and seating plans with pre-assigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible which reduces interaction on school transport services.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020/21.  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current SNA allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process.</p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here: </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed, that the family to whom the Deputy refers, is eligible for School Transport. Medical card details for School Transport for the 2020/2021 school year were received on 7th September 2020 and as such were submitted late.  </p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route.</p></reply>

Swords is one of the school planning areas. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area. </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>Since 2018, 47 new schools to cater for demographic demand have been announced to be established over the period 2019-2022 and included in that number are two new primary schools in Swords: one for Swords South which opened in 2019 and one for Swords North, which opened in September 2020. In addition, at post-primary level, Swords Community College is a new 1,000 student post-primary school established in 2018 to meet the needs of the area. </p><p>In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, my Department continues to liaise with Fingal County Council in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision across the county, through the review of the County Development Plan, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.</p><p>In regard specifically to Fosterstown, the Fingal Development Plan 2017-2023 designates the Fosterstown lands as an area for which a Masterplan had to be produced.  The Fosterstown Masterplan lands were subject to specific objectives including:</p><p>&ndash; providing for New Metro North,</p><p>&ndash; Fosterstown Link road,</p><p>&ndash; a proposed school.</p><p>Fingal County Council advised my Department during 2018 that it intended to produce this Masterplan and sought to re-confirm educational requirements for the area. Following a number of engagements with Council Officials, my Department made a submission to the Council identifying a potential future need for a primary school in the area and the Masterplan acknowledges this potential need by identifying a school site.</p></reply>

The Employment Equality Acts also requires employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of employees and prospective employees with disabilities. </p><p>In order to discharge these statutory management responsibilities effectively and efficiently, it is essential that employers have access to professional occupational health advice on medical fitness for work. The Occupational Health Service (OHS) is in place to assist employers in carrying out this duty in respect of teachers, special needs assistants (SNA)s and also clerical officers/caretakers employed under the 1978/79 Scheme.  The OHS provider, contracted by the Department, is the sole recognised provider of independent medical advice for these employees and their employers. It is a requirement of the Sick Leave Scheme that all employers and employees abide by the OHS medical assessment.</p><p>The OHS provides services that include pre-employment medical assessments, medical assessments of fitness for work, sickness absence management and ill health retirement assessments. Paragraph 3.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme (Chapter 1) for teachers contained in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 54/2019 and also paragraph 3.3 in Circular Letter 60/2019 for SNAs details the basis for an employer referral to the OHS for an independent medical assessment.  This includes an employer who is obliged to make a discretionary referral to the OHS for an independent medical assessment where reasonable concerns exist as to the capacity of the employee to undertake his/her duties in a manner that is safe, such as repeated short-term Sick Leave absences, concerns regarding performance of duties as a result of health factors, work-related factors that may be adversely affecting an employee&rsquo;s health or alcohol/drug related problems. The Employers Procedures Manual contained at Appendix A of these Circulars includes the step by step process for referral of an employee to the OHS for an independent medical assessment.</p><p>Paragraph 12.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme for teachers and paragraph 13.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme for SNAs states the following:-</p><p><i>&lsquo;Confirmation of fitness must also be obtained by the employer from the OHS, prior to resumption of duties, in the case of a teacher/SNA who is (i) absent on paid Sick Leave for 4 or more continuous weeks (or a shorter period where the employer has reasonable grounds for concern), or (ii) absent for any period of TRR/unpaid Sick Leave.&rsquo;</i></p><p>Based on the terms and conditions of the Sick Leave Scheme, where an employer has reasonable concerns about an employee resuming duties, the OHS advice should be sought prior to a return to the workplace.  The OHS Occupational Physicians offer a unique perspective, insight and skill set that allows them to provide an appropriate assessment and informed opinion with respect to an employee&rsquo;s medical fitness for work, as distinct from an opinion on the nature and severity of their medical complaint. </p><p>Where there is a difference of medical opinion between the OHS and the treating Doctor/Consultant on an employee&rsquo;s medical fitness for work, the OHS will consult with the treating Doctor/Consultant before providing final advice to the employer. If there is a specific need for an independent medical assessment, this can be facilitated through the OHS.</p></reply>

The Contract Award Notice was published on 30th July 2020. The majority of suppliers offered alcohol-based products and three among them specialised in alcohol-free products. </p><p>As part of the selection process suppliers were required to confirm that their products were compliant with the biocidal and PPE regulations and provide documentation, information on their current live product range and examples of contracts in the last two years which included supply to the Irish public sector. The suppliers in questions fulfilled these requirements. </p><p>The procurement process was designed to assist schools by providing them with a list of approved suppliers.  Guidance for schools in relation to Hand Hygiene (including the use of hand sanitiser) was set out in the COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of Primary and Special Schools and COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of Post Primary Schools. Copies of the guidance are provided with this reply.</p><p>On 22 October 2020 the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine notified my Department that it had removed ViraPro hand sanitiser from the product register. On the same day my Department removed the supplier of Virapro and its entire product offering from the procurement agreement and advised all schools to cease all use of these products. These products have been on general sale and not just available through the education sector framework.</p><p>On Friday 23<sup>rd</sup>the Department of Agriculture advised not to use any Virapro branded product and this was communicated to schools.</p><p>My Department immediately commenced a review of biocidal products included in the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement.  The review has been undertaken in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which is the regulator in Ireland for biocidal products. </p><p>This involved reviewing 172 items from 14 suppliers.  The outcome of this review was a decision to take 43 biocidal and 9 other products off the approved list for schools because it has not been possible to satisfactorily confirm their registration status as part of this review. These products will not be included in my Department&rsquo;s approved list for schools until their registration status has been confirmed. The Department has no evidence that these products are unsafe.</p><p>Immediately following the product review my Department on Thursday 29 October, 2020 wrote to all schools to advise them of changes to the approved list of products on the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement, and the steps they can take to procure new stock if they need to. Suppliers on the agreement committed to swift processing of orders and delivery to support schools.  </p><p>The Department has added a new supplier to the PPE Agreement, who has confirmed possession of the required biocidal registrations, and 23 new products to the agreement.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the Education Procurement Service are engaging directly with the suppliers concerned regarding the status of these products and it may be possible to reinstate these products to the agreement at a later date. </p><p>In the case of the ViraPro product I understand that the supplier has supplied approximately 10% of schools.  My Department has estimated that the total value of the product supplied is approximately &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000. </p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is engaging with the supplier in relation to the recall.</p><p>Arrangements are in place to ensure that schools impacted will be provided with funding to source new supplies, and to provide for the cost of Aide. My Department continues to work closely with schools to ensure that they will have sufficient PPE and other supplies in time for the reopening of schools after the mid-term break.</p><p>  ">Secondary</p><p>  ">Primary</p></reply>

For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  Budget 2021 builds on this progress by implementing a further 1 point reduction for the 2021/22 school year.  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 school year, which stands at an average of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils, will be published early next year.

The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with with F&oacute;rsa on the claim, most recently on 27th of October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  At that meeting it was agreed that further discussions would be held under the auspices of the WRC with a view to assessing the individual elements comprising the totality of the union&rsquo;s claims.  It is noted that these WRC discussions are taking place within the context of recent D&aacute;il comments concerning the regularisation of pay, conditions of employment and pension provision of School Secretaries and Caretakers.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the complex work that will now be involved in trying to develop all issues in order to reach an agreed outcome. In that regard an understanding has been agreed on a pathway to progress the issues, comprising of several key strands. </p>  <p>  I welcome and support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching an agreed outcome.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport and who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  </p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed, that the children to whom the Deputy refers, are not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their nearest post primary school and are therefore not eligible under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received by the family in question on 11th September 2020 and as such is late and that the service was full when payment was received.</p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

The threshold amount is based on gross income minus trading expenses and before tax and PRSI are deducted.  The measure was implemented with immediate effect and allows a self-employed individual to take up occasional work opportunities and still retain their payment. </p>  <p>  The Part Time Job Incentive is an administrative scheme which allows people who are in receipt of long term Jobseekers Allowance to engage in part time insurable employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a special weekly income supplement.  Under the scheme a jobseeker can apply for this support for at least 390 days. Budget 2021 has extended the Part Time Job Incentive scheme to the self-employed who transition from the Pandemic Unemployment payment.  Under this scheme, a self-employed person receiving the Pandemic Unemployment, can engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours per week and retain a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60.  A qualifying period on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for eligibility for self employed recipients has been removed and this will facilitate immediate access to the scheme for the self-employed. </p>  <p>  A self -employed person also has the option of applying for jobseekers allowance where they are trading at a reduced level and satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputies.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants, a flat payment rate was introduced. This rate was the equivalent of the rate for a two-person household. </p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment moved to 2 rates of payment;  a 3 rate structure is in place since 17 September; and a 4 rate structure is in place since 16 October. These changes more closely link the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned and make the scheme more targeted and fair. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account. </p>  <p>  The rate of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a self-employed person is calculated by reference to their reckonable income in either 2018 or 2019, whichever is the greater.  Details of reckonable income are supplied to the Department by the Revenue Commissioners, and are supplied net of business related costs, including capital allowances.  When submitting returns to the Revenue Commissioners, self-employed persons can offset business related costs against gross trading income, with the resulting assessment to tax and PRSI based on net profits.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The contract of employment offered must be for a minimum of 6 months and the employee must be paid the going rate for the job (which must be at least the statutory minimum wage).</p><p>Private sector employers may claim a subsidy, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability.  The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39 hour week.</p><p>The financial supports for employers are structured under three separate strands and companies could benefit under one strand or under two or three strands simultaneously, as the case may be, depending on the number of people with a disability employed, as below. </p><p><b><i>Strand I</i></b>is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability.  The subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.  </p><p><b><i>Strand II</i></b>subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with disabilities who are supported by a WSS Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs relating to such employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. Therefore when an employer has 23 or more WSS employees a 50% top up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee. <table>    <tr>       <th>3 to 6 employees with a disability </th>       <th>10%  top-up of wage subsidy paid</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7 to 11 employees with a disability </td>       <td>20%  top-up of wage subsidy paid</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 16 employees with a disability </td>       <td>30%  top-up of wage subsidy paid</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 22 employees with a disability </td>       <td>40%  top-up of wage subsidy paid</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23 + employees with a disability </td>       <td>50%  top-up of wage subsidy paid</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><blockquote><b><i>Strand III</i></b>subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer (EAO) to support these employees.</blockquote>Through the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Government recognises the importance for people with disabilities of participation in employment.  As part of the Strategy, my Department is committed to improving employment outcomes and removing barriers to employment for persons with disabilities. The supports provided have been designed to enable people with a disability to achieve their employment ambitions by focusing on the individual&rsquo;s ability and capacity.  The Department offers a range of supports to people with disabilities who may not be in a position to, or wish to, work full-time. </p><p>For instance, the Department&rsquo;s INTREO service is available to any person with a disability who wishes to avail of the service.  People with a disability may, on a voluntary basis, seek an appointment with an employment supports case officer to discuss their employment ambitions and develop a personal progression plan. Supports  include assistance and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities from a dedicated Case Officer, a focused service, based on individual needs to support a jobseeker to enter or re-enter the workforce and an access to job vacancies via the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s national www.jobsireland.ie website</p><p>EmployAbility is a specialist service (delivered under a contract arrangement with 24 companies in 31 locations around the country on behalf of the Department) which works with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo and Local Employment Services.  EmployAbility participants are people with a disability who are able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and who need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  Budget 2021 included a measure to introduce a training support grant for Jobseekers availing of  Employability services.  The grant will seek to fund quick access to short term training or other supports for jobseekers with disabilities.  The grant will be up to &euro;1,000 and will be available in Q1 2021.</p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services (LES) with 22 companies in 26 locations.  Providers deliver a case managed employment service for all Jobseekers (including those with disabilities) who avail of the services. Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.  Jobseekers either engage directly with LES providers or are referred by my Department for employment service supports. LES Mediators may refer clients of the service to an EmployAbility service provider, if it is felt the person would benefit from this more specialised service</p><p>Partial Capacity Benefit is designed for people who are in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (for at least six months) and who have some capacity for work.

This resulted in an overpayment of &euro;450.00.

This extension will be made available retrospectively to parents in respect of children born or adopted on or after 1st November 2019.  The period during which this leave can be taken will be extended from 12 to 24 months so it can be taken up to a child's second birthday or within two years following adoption. </p>  <p>  There is a necessary lead-in time following the announcement of this extension to facilitate its implementation.  Firstly, legislative change is required by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth which has responsibility for parents leave policy.  This legislation needs to be carefully prepared and drafted before being brought through the Oireachtas, given that it extends a statutory leave entitlement that, in addition to benefitting workers, has implications for employers.</p>  <p>  It will also be necessary for parallel amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) to be drafted and brought through the Oireachtas to provide the legislative basis for the extended payment of benefit.</p>  <p>  In addition, significant changes are required to the Department's systems to administer this extension, including the provision of retrospective entitlement.  This work needs to be undertaken in such a way that is does not compromise existing supports in an environment where there are unprecedented levels of demand on the Department&rsquo;s services due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The extra weeks of leave will be made available as soon as the necessary legislation which is being drafted by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is enacted. </p>  <p>  Once the new application and payment system goes live in April, my Department will then process and issue benefit payments - to include backdated payment of benefit as appropriate - in respect of Parents Leave taken from the date of enactment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.</p>  <p>  In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12-month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those whose eligibility is based  on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department. The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria. </p>  <p>  The person concerned  was to complete his time on CE on 13/11/2020.  However, due to Level 5 restrictions his contract has been extended and he will now finish up on 4/12/2020. </p>  <p>  During his time on CE  he  has completed a number of courses including Safe Pass, Sports Surface maintenance, Manual Handling and a number of Horticulture related courses.  The purpose of the training and support that he received while on CE was to prepare him for full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  On finishing CE the person concerned may avail of my Department's Activation service who will work with him  to ensure that the benefits of the experience and training he received during his time on CE are maximised.  A case officer will assess his skills, experience, challenges and work goals and assist him in finding full-time sustainable employment.  This process will also help identify potential employment opportunities and offers support to Jobseeker&rsquo;s  in overcoming any barriers to employment</p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  </p>  <p>  While I understand that sponsoring bodies may wish to extend a CE participant's time on a CE scheme or CE participants themselves may wish to extend their time on a CE scheme, the Deputy will appreciate that such extensions would have a detrimental effect on other long-term unemployed candidates wishing to avail of the opportunities afforded by CE.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.2287.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300123#WRVV05100"><p>The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.  This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Officials in my Department will be examining the policy options for reforming the state pension system both in this area and, more generally, in relation to considerations around a Total Contributions Approach.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  As a consequence, the Programme for Government commits to establishing a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including sustainability, eligibility, contributions and calculation methods.  The Terms of Reference for this Commission and options for its membership are currently being finalised for consideration by Government. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current situation is that through the award of credited contributions, normally known as credits, the social insurance system gives significant recognition to time spent caring in terms of qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory).  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.  </p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the Homemaker scheme.  The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State Pension (Contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculated using the Yearly Average method. </p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as T12) was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.  </p>  <p>  Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, my Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for my Department and it is hoped to make payments before the end of the year. The information sought by the Deputy on the number of individuals awaiting payment is not available at this time as work on the development and deployment of the automated process has not concluded.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main focus of the allowance is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment.  </p>  <p>  The BTEA has been extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19.  Ordinarily a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum period before being eligible to apply for the BTEA when pursuing training or education.  The qualifying period has been waived for people coming from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  This ensures that those who have lost their employment during the pandemic have immediate access to a range of educational options.  </p>  <p>  In order to avail of continued financial support while pursuing a full-time course, a person in receipt of the PUP should apply for a jobseeker payment.  The BTEA is payable at the jobseekers rate.  Whereas the PUP is short term in nature, the Back to Education Allowance may provide longer term income support depending on the individual&rsquo;s circumstances. </p>  <p>  Where someone in receipt of PUP wishes to pursue short term or part-time study they can continue to receive PUP while they continue to satisfy the conditions of that payment.  </p>  <p>  Any person seeking to return to education should engage with their local Intreo Centre to assess their options.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They were notified in writing of this decision on 1 October 2018.</p>  <p>  Under the Homemaker's Scheme, any years that an insured person spent as a homemaker since 6 April 1994 are disregarded when working out their yearly average period for a State pension (contributory).

However, their rate of pension entitlement was lower than their current standard rate of pension.  Their public sector employment record was recently reviewed as requested by the person concerned, but their rate of entitlement to a mixed insurance pro rata pension remains lower than their current standard rate of pension. They were notified in writing of this decision on 21 October 2020.</p>  <p>  An interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) was introduced in January 2018 as an alternative to the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; method of calculating pension entitlement for those State pension (contributory) customers born on or after 1 September 1946 and therefore affected by post-2012 Budget pension rates.  The TCA provides for up to 20 years of HomeCaring Periods in their pension entitlement calculation for applicants who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p>  <p>  When the person&rsquo;s State pension (contributory) was reviewed under this approach, they were awarded 603 HomeCaring Periods.

For example if a person is committed to participate in the employment scheme for 5 mornings, any JobPath meetings and other interventions will be scheduled for the afternoons.

The purpose of this change is to allow people the choice of continuing to collect payments on a fortnightly basis should they so wish in order to minimise the number of times they attend and queue in banks or post offices.</p>  <p>  If any person has received an expired payments letter, they should contact my Department so that their social welfare payment can be reinstated.  </p>  <p>  For the duration of the pandemic, alternative payment arrangements, such as the option to have one&rsquo;s payment made directly into a current account by electronic fund transfer (EFT), are accommodated at the request of a customer to the Department.  This allows for the payment to be paid directly into a current account in any financial institution, whether that be with An Post, a bank or a credit union.  An Post has been kept informed of this initiative.</p>  <p>  Finally, the rules around nominating agents to collect social welfare payments at post offices have also been changed to allow for more agent collections, whereby customers can nominate a trusted individual to collect a payment on their behalf.</p></reply>

It is paid to people who are in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments and who also satisfy certain other conditions. CA is not a qualifying payment for receipt of fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  However, carers may qualify for fuel allowance if they are in receipt of half-rate carer's allowance and another qualifying social welfare payment.  Alternatively, if the carer resides with their care recipient, that care recipient may be in receipt of a qualifying payment and entitled to apply for the fuel allowance in their own right.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the person concerned was in receipt of CA at half-rate from 27 June 2016 to 19 December 2018 as she was also in receipt of One Parent Family payment (OPF).  OPF is a qualifying payment for fuel allowance. </p>  <p>  Her OPF ceased on 19 December 2018 and she was re-rated from half-rate to full-rate CA from 20 December 2018 due to her being in receipt of no other Social Welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was entitled to fuel allowance while in receipt of OPF and half-rate CA.

A person may qualify for a heating supplement, if they can show that they have extra heating needs because of their age, medical condition or disability, are living alone or only with a dependent adult or dependent children and satisfy a means test.</p>  <p>  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is decided on the particular circumstances of the case. The person concerned could apply for these payments from her local community welfare service.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The last day of insurable employment must be within 16 weeks of the end of the week in which her baby is due.  If a woman satisfies these conditions and ceases employment within this 16 week timeframe, payment of maternity benefit can commence from the following day. </p>  <p>  Where an individual is not in employment within the 16 week timeframe or has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for maternity benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment, such as a jobseeker payment, provided they meet the relevant conditions.  </p>  <p>  A special arrangement has been made for those who have lost their employment as a direct consequence of the Pandemic.

They applied for State pension (contributory) on 10 November 2011.  For persons who reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012, social welfare legislation stipulates that a minimum of 520 full-rate paid contributions are required to qualify for State pension (contributory).  Credits cannot be used to satisfy this condition. 520 full-rate contributions equate to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment.</p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s social insurance record has been fully investigated.  According to the records of my Department, they have 458 paid full-rate social insurance contributions.  Their self-employment contributions were paid after the person reached 66 and therefore under social welfare legislation are not reckonable for pension purposes.  A Social Welfare Inspector did not find proof of employment in 1963 to recommend the award of contributions for any part of that year.  Since the person&rsquo;s contributions fall short of the required 520 paid full-rate contributions to qualify for State pension (contributory), their claim was disallowed.  </p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department, the person concerned was in receipt of Carer's Allowance from 1 November 1990 to 29 July 2002.   Under social welfare legislation, credits shall not be awarded where there is a two-year gap between these credits and the person&rsquo;s last paid full-rate contribution.  Since the person concerned does not have a record of paid contributions from insurable employment prior to 1990, there is no entitlement to credits.  </p>  <p>  Where credits are reckonable, they can only be included in calculation of a person&rsquo;s pension entitlement once the minimum requirement of 520 full-rate paid contributions is satisfied.  If the person concerned considers they have additional contributions from employment that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence of the missing periods of employment to my Department and their pension entitlement will be reviewed. </p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to consider applying for the State pension (non-contributory).  This is a means-tested, residency-based payment for people of pension age.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the applicant (and spouse/civil partner/cohabitant as applicable).  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits that a Commission on Pensions will be established to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to announce that the Government today approved the establishment of this Commission.  Its Terms of Reference and membership have been published on the Department's website at www.gov.ie/dsp.  It is imperative that the Commission has the required expertise to progress its work and is independent in its deliberations and this is reflected in its membership with subject matter experts and stakeholder representatives.  </p>  <p>  As part of its work and deliberations, the Commission will seek views from other recognised experts and representative/advocacy groups by inviting submissions and/or presentations.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year and the Government will take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months of receiving that report. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I was pleased to announce on Budget Day that the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred, in line with our Programme for Government commitment, and it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Commission on Pensions.  I will introduce legislation later this year to do that.  </p>  <p>  While this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

A self-employed person must have suffered a reduction in their trading income to the extent that they are available for other full time work to be eligible to apply for the scheme. </p>  <p>  Income supports are available to employees who take up limited PAYE employment and are no longer eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  They may opt to transfer to a jobseeker's payment which allows a person to take up employment where they are unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 consecutive days.  Jobseeker's Benefit is available to people who have sufficient social insurance contributions paid and satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the scheme.  Short-Time Work Support is a form of Jobseeker's Benefit and is an income support payment for people who have been temporarily placed on a shorter working week by their employer.</p>  <p>  Where a person doesn&rsquo;t qualify for jobseeker's benefit they may be eligible for the means tested jobseeker's allowance. </p>  <p>  Increased allowances may also be paid on jobseeker claims for qualifying adults and children.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for you. </p></reply>

The changes are effective from 13 October 2020.</p>  <p>  In effect an earnings threshold of &euro;480 per rolling 4 week period will be used to assess whether or not a self-employed person is substantively employed/unemployed.  Any self-employed person earning below this amount will be considered to be unemployed for the purposes of assessing entitlement to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  The earnings threshold is aligned with the income disregard currently in place for people in receipt of Disability Allowance.  A self-employed person availing of this does not need to seek approval from the Department and they do not need to report these earnings to the Department on a regular basis.  They do need to keep a record of all income for the period.</p>  <p>  The Earnings Threshold approach is being implemented in the first instance by means of self-assessment with spot checks of a sample of claims by Social Welfare inspectors and ultimately reconciliation with Revenue earnings returns.</p>  <p>  Staff in the Department, including those in Intreo Centres and Branch Offices, have been briefed on the changes.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2021, I increased the rates for a qualified child under 12 by &euro;2 to &euro;38 per week, and for qualified children of 12 or older by &euro;5 to &euro;45 per week (from January 2021).  </p>  <p>  However, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2018 shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by nearly two-thirds.  This highlights that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 I removed the gross income limit of &euro;425 per week from the one-parent family payment.  This will enable lone parents earning over that amount to claim or retain the payment from April 2021.  The one-parent family payment weekly income disregard amount remains at &euro;165, which exceeds the &euro;146.50 amount recommended in the 2017 report.  The Working Family Payment thresholds for parents with up to 3 children will also increase by an additional &euro;10 per week from January 2021.</p>  <p>  The activation service provided by my Department focuses on supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment.  At a cross-governmental level, the focus is on assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.  All of these services are crucial to assisting lone parents into employment, and to lifting both them and their children out of poverty.   </p>  <p>  I trust that clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In Budget 2021 and in recent years, Governments have provided for a number of measures specifically targeted at alleviating child poverty and assisting low income families, particularly lone parents, including;</p><p>- An increase of &euro;5 per week in the weekly rate for children aged 12 and over to &euro;45 per week and a &euro;2 per week increase for children under 12 to &euro;38 per week in Budget 2021.  (Increases in qualified child payments were also introduced in Budget 2018, 2019, 2020 while Budget 2019 also introduced a higher qualified child rate for children aged 12 and over).</p><p>- Increases in the weekly income disregards for the One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments &ndash; from &euro;90 in Budget 2016 to &euro;165 in Budget 2020 and the removal of the earnings limit of &euro;425 for One-Parent Family Payment in Budget 2021.</p><p>- Increase in the Working Family Payment earnings thresholds by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children in Budget 2020 and Budget 2021.</p><p>Child Poverty cannot, however, be alleviated by income supports alone.  A whole of Government approach is needed which ensures access to a range of services and supports for children and their families.  Across Government, we must strive to ensure that these households do not get left further behind as a result of the pandemic. </p><p>Following the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March, schools and organisations participating in the school meals programme expressed concerns about the impact of school closures on pupils who avail of school meals, and that the unavailability of school meals impacts in particular on the most disadvantaged. </p><p>My Department confirmed that funding to schools would continue to enable schools provide food until the end of the school year in line with the parameters of the school meals scheme.  This resulted in food parcels being delivered to or collected by families. Funding was extended to cover the summer months to ensure that children could continue to receive food. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021 and following the success of the hot school meals pilot, I have announced the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children from January 2021.  </p><p>My Department also administers the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk.  In 2019, my Department spent &euro;5.3m on the FEAD programme through the ongoing distribution of food and the distribution of material assistance.  Though a network of 150 charitable partnership organisations, the Department distributed over 1,323 tonnes of food to just over 195,000 people in communities throughout the country, either in the form of food parcels or as meals prepared by a charitable organisation.  To date in 2020, &euro;4.8m has been spent on the FEAD programme.</p><p>Difficulty in meeting food and other regular ongoing needs may result from a family encountering exceptional once-off expenditures.  In this regard, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an exceptional needs payment should contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service at their local office. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the deputy. </p></reply>

The first reflection of this commitment was in the convening of coordinated dedicated events across the country as part of Jobs Week in March 2020.  The first "Career Pathways for Returners" flagship event  was hosted by my Department in Trinity College on Friday 6th March 2020, just before the Covid pandemic emergency.  The event provided those who were considering re-joining the workforce with information on work placements, opportunities to upskill or retrain and offered them the opportunity to take the next step in their careers.  Speakers presented on subjects such as motivation and reaching one's potential while others provided testimonials and personal stories on re-launching their careers.  The event included opportunities to meet and speak with employers, some of whom had Returners Initiatives or "returnship" programmes.  The aim of the event was to support potential returners by helping them to consider the opportunities available to them to map their route back to work into roles aligned to their needs, interests and personal potential.  It was one of more than 20 such events convened on the day across the country.  </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of continuing to access this pool of talent in order to provide employment opportunities and increase labour market participation levels for groups that are currently inactive or underrepresented in the labour force.  We will continue to promote the supports available for workforce returners, be they men or women, including measures that assist people to upskill with a view to returning to work.    </p>  <p>  Once the immediate emergency demands of Covid-19 stabilise, my officers will resume work on planning initiatives to support returners.

Child benefit is currently paid to over 638,800 families in respect of over 1.2 million children with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2019.</p><p>There are no current plans to extend the payment in respect of students over the age of eighteen in second level education.  Families on low incomes may be able to avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of twenty two, including:  </p><p>- Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;  </p><p>- the Working Family Payment for low-paid employees with children;  </p><p>- the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance  </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, I increased the rates for a qualified child under 12 by &euro;2 to &euro;38 per week, and for qualified children of 12 or older by &euro;5 to &euro;45 per week (from January 2021).  This was in recognition of the higher costs associated with older children. </p><p>Extending child benefit in respect of full time students in second level education who are over eighteen years of age would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

She did not qualify for JB on the basis that she had not paid Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions in the relevant governing contribution year, which was 2018.  The person concerned was then assessed for JA which is a means-tested payment.</p>  <p>  The weekly household means for the person concerned were assessed at &euro;385 based on her spouses&rsquo; earnings.

Intreo staff work every day with customers to resolve issues and explain decisions to the satisfaction of the customer. Where a customer might be concerned, confused or at times dissatisfied, Intreo staff take their time to resolve issues to the satisfaction of the customer. These issues are not recorded as formal complaints.</p>  <p>  Where a customer is subsequently unhappy about any aspect of their dealings with the Department, they can make a formal complaint at any time through the Department's website Gov.ie using the Customer feedback form. These formal complaints are recorded and managed centrally by the Department's dedicated Customer Service Unit.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, any customer can make contact by phone, letter, or email a member of staff who will record the complaint on their behalf. Once a complaint is received, an acknowledgement is issued within three working days including a reference number. Complaints are then forwarded to the Customer Service Officer within the relevant business area to be investigated and responded to within 15 working days. If it is not possible to issue a response within that timeframe, an interim response will issue and provide an expected completion date. All complaints are dealt with promptly, fairly, impartially, and in confidence. The outcome of the investigation will be reflected in the final response.</p>  <p>  If the response is not satisfactory, a review of the complaint can be requested, with an explanation as to why the customer is unhappy with the original response. A review is then conducted by another Customer Service Officer, in many cases the line manager of the original responder.</p>  <p>  If the review does not resolve the issue, the complainant is advised that they can contact the Office of the Ombudsman to seek to have the matter examined by that office.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The Department will continue to provide funding for CE schemes.

It is available to employees who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of Covid-19. It is also available to self-employed people whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the pandemic to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment. </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is payable where a person was an employed contributor in the week immediately before he or she ceased to earn an income from the employment concerned. Similarly, a self-employed person must have been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the date on which their self-employment income ceased or reduced. It is a long-standing feature of social welfare legislation that individuals who are engaged in employment or self-employment are liable to pay PRSI on those activities. In those circumstances, persons claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment should have no difficulty satisfying these conditions.</p>  <p>  The Department uses earnings data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners for 2019 and 2020 in the case of employees, and 2018 and 2019 in the case of self-employed people. Data is updated as often as practicable, and in the case of employees on a daily basis. In cases where no evidence of PRSI contributions can be located, individuals are asked to submit proof of employment to the Department. When this is received and verified, claims are put into payment as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  To satisfy the household composition criteria an applicant may live alone or only with:</p>  <p>- a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren); (if the qualified spouse is in receipt of half rate carers, in addition to the IQA payment , they may qualify for fuel allowance,  subject to a means test) or</p>  <p>- a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to the allowance in their own right or</p>  <p>- a person who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of providing full-time care and attention to the fuel allowance applicant or their qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren) or</p>  <p>  - a person receiving pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), a person receiving short-term jobseeker's allowance (JA) or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) - i.e., less than 391 days for JA and less than 15 months/456 days for SWA). </p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is not payable if an applicant lives with any person, including a family member,  that is not covered by the criteria outlined.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

The Government's main tool to progress this goal is the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  </p>  <p>  This Strategy represents a whole-of-Government approach to bring about meaningful change and progress for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. It is a living document that will be reviewed and adjusted as required. Traveller and Roma organisations were involved in its development and are members of the Committee monitoring its implementation which is chaired by me.  </p>  <p>  One of the thematic pillars contained in the Strategy covers the area of employment. The actions contained in this theme cover a cross-Departmental approach aiming to increase employment opportunities for members of the Traveller and Roma communities. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) has developed a number of targeted initiatives to increase Traveller and Roma engagement with employment and training services. DEASP also continues to provide tailored supports for the long-term unemployed within the Traveller community and for young people to build their confidence and prepare them for the workplace. </p>  <p>  In addition to the strategic framework, the Government provides significant amounts of funding to Traveller projects. In 2020, &euro;3.8 million in funding was provided to support Traveller and Roma inclusion. An additional &euro;1 million has also been granted for 2021, bringing the total to almost &euro;5 million. This funding will be used to continue existing supports, as well as support new activities designed to counteract the impact of COVID-19 on Traveller and Roma communities.</p></reply>

The arrivals for the first two years will largely comprise Syrian refugees resident in Jordan and Lebanon, along with a pilot group of 150 Eritrean refugees resident in Ethiopia. </p>  <p>  A mission to Beirut took place in March 2020 and plans are in train to arrange the arrival of 220 refugees interviewed by Irish officials at that time.  The IRPP team in my Department remains in contact with international partners to monitor the evolving Covid-19 situation and arrange further arrivals of pledged refugees.</p>  <p>  The IRPP maintains an ongoing engagement with public health officials in Ireland concerning future resettlements in order to ensure the safety of refugees and in the interests of public health in Ireland.  All those arriving are tested for the Covid-19 virus and subject to quarantine on arrival. </p></reply>

The budget allocated for AIM in 2020 is &euro;43 million.</p><p>The focus of AIM is on the needs of the child in the context of the preschool setting, and therefore access to AIM supports does not require a formal diagnosis. AIM has seven levels of progressive support, moving from universal (levels 1 to 3) to targeted (levels 4 to 7).  Details of the seven levels of support are presented below. </p><p>As AIM is an integral part of the ECCE programme, the criteria for eligibility regarding age of the child is the same as for the ECCE programme, i.e. between 2 year 8 months and 5 years 6 months. AIM supports are available for the two years of the ECCE programme. </p><p>AIM is a highly collaborative, cross-Government initiative, with implementation shared across a number of different bodies. Since its introduction in 2016, AIM has provided over 14,100 children with disabilities with over 33,000 targeted supports across over 3,500 preschools. Thousands more preschool children are benefitting from the universal supports provided under AIM. A full evaluation of the Access and Inclusion Model is due to commence before the end of the year. </p><p><b>Level 1: An Inclusive Culture: </b>This level is the critical foundation for the model. It sets out that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE Programme. Supports include the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of a Level 6 NFQ programme on leadership for inclusion (LINC), the establishment of Inclusion Co-ordinators (INCO) in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified INCOs.</p><p><b>Level 2: Information for Parents and Providers: </b>This level recognises the requirement of parents and preschool providers to have clear, consistent and up to date information accessible to them regarding ECCE services and supports and this is supported through the AIM.gov.ie website and also information provided by County/City Childcare Committees.</p><p><b>Level 3: A Qualified and Confident Workforce:  </b>This level recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of Continuing Professional Development courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL) courses.</p><p><b>Level 4: Expert Educational Advice and Support &ndash; </b>This level addresses the needs of early years practitioners across the country to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early years education (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.</p><p><b>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grant: </b>This level recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early years settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service.</p><p><b>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention</b>: This level provides for access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE Programme.</p><p><b>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Preschool Room: </b>This level recognises that a some children will require more support than is available through Levels 1-6. With this Level, additional capitation is available to service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports at Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. The application is made by both provider and parent. It can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or to reduce the staff / child ratio, supporting the preschool service to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation. </p></reply>

Unexplained absences include all cases where the school has not received an explanation from parent/guardians regarding a student&rsquo;s absences or where the explanations given are of concern to the school. </p>  <p>  Educational Welfare Officers (EWO) intervene when a school indicates a concern regarding a student&rsquo;s absences.

In the Quality and Regulatory Framework published in 2018, Tusla, the independent statutory regulator, recognised the First Aid Responder (FAR) education and training standard established by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) as meeting this requirement as it is inclusive of content and instruction relating to first aid for children.</p>  <p>  Whilst it was originally planned that services would have until June 2020 to comply with this new requirement, Tusla have agreed that due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the timeframe would be extended into 2021. In addition, for those staff that already have FAR certification which has now expired or is due to expire, their certificates will remain valid until FAR training courses are up and running again. </p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department made financial support available to enable early learning and care services, including Tusla-registered childminders, to avail of FAR training, through the Learner Fund. This funding was continued into 2020. By the end of this year, my Department will have provided more than &euro;376,000 to support 1,867 individuals in early learning and care services to complete the training.</p></reply>

My officials are currently working on the apportionment of these funds in the context of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume later this year. As such, I am not in a position as yet to provide a detailed breakdown of these allocations. </p>  <p>  As part of the Budget 2021 announcements, the youth sector has also been allocated a capital sum of &euro;3m. This funding, which is the same amount as provided in 2020, will support the annual youth sector capital scheme to be designed and rolled out in 2021. While no decisions on areas to be prioritised as part of this fund have yet been made, ICT was a prominent feature of the scheme in 2020. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have secured an additional amount of &euro;1m capital funding in the current year to support ICT procurement in the youth sector before year end. This grant scheme is being rolled out through the ETBs in their role as funding intermediary for youth schemes and was formally announced in the last few days. This sum is additional to the Covid-related small grant scheme for the sector recently announced.</p>  <p>  This additional funding allocated to youth services in the coming year will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide with a particular view to the role played by youth services in supporting mental wellbeing, fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people, including disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable young people. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.2626.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300130#WRCCC02800"><p>My Department has introduced a number of measures to support the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) sector during these unprecedented times.</p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was introduced on 1 August 2020. EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll; and it charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid that are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p><p>ELC and SAC services registered with Tusla received an exemption from the EWSS turnover requirements. The rate of subsidy the employer will receive per paid eligible employee under EWSS was enhanced on 20 October 2020 in response to nationwide level 5 restrictions. </p><p>Under the enhanced rates, ELC and SAC services with EWSS will have approximately 80% of payroll costs covered. This equates to approximately 50% of the usual operating costs of these services &ndash; allowing them to operate sustainably with lower occupancy rates and higher delivery costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Government introduced the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 on 15 September 2020. The plan outlines the medium-term approach to managing risk and supporting society and business through Covid restrictions at each level from 1 to 5.  The plan recognises that education (ELC, SAC and schooling) provides for the holistic development of children and young people and is the foundation for lifelong learning and wellbeing. It is also essential to parents&rsquo; abilities to balance work with family responsibilities especially those in the workforce on whom we rely to deliver essential services. For this reason, keeping ELC and SAC open is a top priority at each level of restrictions.</p><p>Under the July stimulus support package, my Department continues to provide all ELC and SAC subsidy schemes at existing capitation and subsidy rates. These include the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) Saver Programme, Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Saver Programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme. </p><p>The recent introduction of the Covid-19 Sustainability Support Fund 2020 is in addition to the all-of-Government July Stimulus package for ELC and SAC Services.  The purpose of the grant is to support the sustainability of ELC and SAC services whose viability is still negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic - in circumstances where supplementary support is required in addition to other July Stimulus supports such as the EWSS. </p><p>This is the first time that my Department&rsquo;s sustainability funding has been made available to both private for-profit providers and community non-profit providers, subject to eligibility criteria and an assessment of need. The funding is also available to eligible sole traders for whom the EWSS is not applicable because they do not have employees, including ECCE providers</p><p>The sustainability grant provides funding to successful applicants to offset losses caused by a decrease in occupancy and/or an increase in costs. Sustainability will be supported by providing a grant proportionate to the short-term level of loss in 2020. </p><p>While it is hoped that the recently-announced enhancements to the EWSS will result in a significant decrease in need for this funding, the Covid-19 sustainability support remains available, where needed. Applications for the first round of funding closed on 20 October, and the dates of future application windows will be announced shortly.</p><p>In addition to the Covid-19 sustainability support, my Department oversees a case management support facility through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide assistance to ELC and SAC services in difficulty. This support, can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting, cash flow difficulties, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.  Any service that needs this support should contact their local CCC in the first instance. </p><p>In terms of the provision of specific public health advice and guidance for the sector, expert health guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the Covid-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May and updated on 31 July. No additional measures apply under the current level 5 restrictions.</p></reply>

In addition, it was necessary to put its meetings on hold in the context of the restrictions introduced in an effort to reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19. A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and, given the age profile involved, some members could also be categorised as being in the at risk groups identified by public health authorities. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges I am committed to effective stakeholder engagement on all matters that impact former residents of these institutions and their advocates. I am considering how best to facilitate that in the immediate term, in particular, in light of current public health restrictions related to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a copy of the Collaborative Forum's report was provided by my Department to the Commission of Investigation for its appropriate attention and consideration in the context of its statutory investigations.  I have recently received the final report from the Commission of Investigation and arrangements are being advanced for its publication as soon as possible. I will keep former residents appraised of developments in this regard through the established communication channels.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the significant work of the Collaborative Forum, to identify the priority concerns of those most centrally involved, will greatly assist in formulating an appropriate State response to the findings and recommendations of the Commission. Further engagement and consultation with former residents, their families and advocates will also be central to this process.  </p></reply>

This will require extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.

The Attorney General has confirmed that individuals will have a right of access to their own personal data held by the Minister, noting that such rights of access are subject to the provisions set out in section 39 of the 2004 Act. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is important to clarify that the recently enacted <i>Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020</i>was brought forward to ensure access to personal information contained in an extensive database compiled by the Commission, tracking entry and exit pathways in the main Mother and Baby Homes.</p><p>I recognise that the broader issues of access the Commission's archive for historical research or other purposes, while outside the parameters of existing legislation, are important ones and, in this regard, I would point to the Government's recent commitment to a National Archive and I will be working in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach to advance this further. </p></reply>

It looks to support improvement of outcomes for children through poverty reduction and facilitation of labour activation. These can be achieved by encouraging and supporting work or training. </p><p>The number of NCS hours available during term time will depend on the education stage of the child, and whether the parent is engaged in work or study. Since September, the maximum number of &lsquo;wrap-around&rsquo; hours has increased by one additional hour. As the Deputy is aware the definition of work under the NCS is extremely broad, covering all forms of work arrangement: full-time, part-time, week-on/ week-off and zero hour contracts.  The study rule is also a generous one and allows parents to access up to 45 hours of childcare when completing any NFQ qualification, from level 1, for even a small number of hours per week.  </p><p>The policy basis and under-pinning research for the National Childcare Scheme is set out in the Policy Paper on the Development of a New Single Affordable Childcare Scheme published in October 2016.</p><p>Of particular note with regard to children's outcomes is Melhuish, E. <i>et al. </i>(2015) <i>A Review of Research on the Effects of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) on Child Development</i>, Curriculum and Quality Analysis and Impact Review of European Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC-CARE). </p><p>This research concludes that the benefits of early care and education are, for most children, achieved with part-time participation. </p><p>I would also note that where children are not in school (i.e. during school holidays), they can continue to access childcare provision for up to 20 hours per week where one of the parents is not in work or study. In this way, stay at home parents can have a continuum of access to external child development supports through the school and through childcare provision</p></reply>

Notably, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full 60 acres involved, let alone the rest of the 200-acre estate on which there has been extensive building work since the institution closed. There was also uncertainty as to whether the children may in fact be buried at a recognised graveyard in respect of which records could not be located.

A Public Services Card and verified MyGovID account are required to apply online only.</p>  <p>  At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection temporarily suspended PSC appointments and closed their Intreo Offices under the public health guidelines which meant that those citizens who had not verified their MyGovID accounts could not do so, if they did not already have a phone number verified with DEASP. However, we are aware that DEASP implemented temporary measures to mitigate this and to enable potential applicants to become MyGovID verified. DEASP have since reopened most of their Intreo offices. </p>  <p>  Parents who do not have a Public Services Card can apply for the Scheme via the paper-based route. Parents can contact the NCS Parent Support Centre and arrange to have the correct application form sent out to them.

The sudden closure of centre-based Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) services on 12 March was an unexpected but necessary move to safeguard public health in Ireland. </p>  <p>  It has always been communicated by my Department that subsidy awards are payable from the week they are claimed, and not the date of application. It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such, the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public monies and that the investment is following the child.</p>  <p>  The work patterns of staff within my Department overseeing the National Childcare Scheme were unaffected by Covid-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Further information and resources for parents are available at www.ncs.gov.ie.</p></reply>

My Department is responsible for mobilising EU funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) while the Department of Education and Skills is the designated authority in Ireland for policy and operational matters related to the ESF PEIL.  My Department is a beneficiary under that funding programme.</p>  <p>  In 2015, as part of Ireland's response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe, the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.  To date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) and it is expected that we will welcome the remaining complement in due course.  </p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the programme was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship.  The Government also announced on 01 October that Ireland will welcome up to 50 people in family groups from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) following displacement from the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos due to the recent fire that destroyed the camp. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) for resettling refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at the local level, with support from my Department's IRPP team.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through a process carried out by an implementing partner with expertise in community integration and relevant supports. </p>  <p>  The IRPP team have agreements with Local Authorities on numbers to be allocated to housing provided by the Local Authorities over a defined period.  The IRPP funds a programme whereby the Local Authorities engage the implementing partner organisation to assist with the resettlement operations &ndash; providing advice, guidance, etc. to refugees once they settle in their new homes in the community.  Each family has the support of an assigned resettlement worker to assist with the transition along with the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural Support Worker. The  Local Authorities are paid an agreed grant amount to fund this aspect of the operation.  This is paid from Exchequer funding.  However,a certain amount of that expenditure can be eligible for recoupment from the EU&rsquo;s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF).</p></reply>

This request was brought before Government at the relevant time and an extension was approved until June 2020.  A request for a further extension was subsequently approved by Government to 30 October 2020.</p><p>Although it was a very short report, the Sixth Interim Report nonetheless raised complex legal and practical issues related to the completion of the Commission&rsquo;s programme of work. In it, the Commission stated that it is obliged to redact sensitive personal information before depositing its records with the Minister.  This includes redacting an important and unique database which it has created in the course of its investigation and which would be highly valuable in the provision of statutory adoption information and tracing services.  </p><p>These issues have required intensive engagement with the both the Commission and the Office of the Attorney General.  These were the issues which the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020 was enacted to resolve.  </p><p>The report itself does not include findings by the Commission on the substantive matters which it was examining.</p><p>I will seek Government approval for the publication the Sixth Interim Report in tandem with the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, to ensure its contents are available for everyone to examine.</p></reply>

I want to acknowledge their engagement and their courage in sharing their deeply personal experiences with me.  I want to ensure that those centrally involved have a strong voice in the deliberations and decisions that are to come and the Government has endorsed my commitment in this regard. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks the volume of contacts increased significantly, primarily from those wishing to express their concern in relation to the published legislative proposals for the Commission's records, and the wider issues of access to birth records and related matters. The concerns primarily related to the issue of access to the archive of the Commission, and were not focused on the substantive purpose of the legislation before the Houses which was to preserve records and ensure that a valuable database could be immediately made available to support former residents.  </p>  <p>  Recognising that the broader issue of access the Commission's archive, while lying outside the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another matter, Act 2020, was an extremely important one, I committed to detailed engagement with the Attorney General on this matter.  The Attorney has already provided important clarifications which should help to address the very important concern raised as it related to access to personal data.   I also introduced a number of further amendments in the course of the passage of the legislation, and I believe these changes address a number of other concerns raised.  </p>  <p>  I know members of both Houses received significant volumes of correspondence on these matters. I do acknowledge and regret the genuine hurt and concern felt by many people across Irish society in relation to this issue. I am determined to take the necessary actions to ensure that these concerns are dealt with in a manner that is timely, appropriate and that is focused on the needs of victims and survivors.</p>  <p>  I am committed to protecting the archive of records which I will receive from the Commission on its dissolution early next year and to ensure that the rights of all citizens to access personal information about themselves, under data protection legislation and the GDPR are fully respected and implemented. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage closely with the Office of the Attorney General Office and the Data Protection Commissioner, and additional resources will be provided where necessary to achieve this. </p>  <p>  I will ensure that, throughout all of this process, engagement and consultation with former residents, their families and advocates will be central to the formulation and delivery of a comprehensive State response to these matters.</p></reply>

This survey provides valuable data on the current experiences of young people living in rural areas, who were found to be particularly impacted by the sense of isolation associated with restrictions. </p>  <p>  Youth services funded by my Department have played a critical role in supporting such young people throughout the ongoing challenging period. Youth services foster a sense of connection in addition to enabling young people to fulfil their potential by strengthening their personal and social competencies and developing their resilience and mental well-being. </p>  <p>  Between 2016 and 2020 the annual current funding invested in youth schemes by the Department has increased from &euro;51.9m to &euro;61.79m. The UBU - Your Place Your Space, which was launched in July this year, is targeted at young people aged between 10 &ndash; 24 years who are vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised. Young people experiencing rural isolation are a particular target group of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Allocation of funding under the UBU scheme follows a defined process taking account of quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within a particular area. This approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidenced need. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds more universally-focussed, volunteer-led, youth work through the Youth Service Grant Scheme, which supports young people in both rural and urban communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the key role of the youth sector in supporting young people through the pandemic, I have secured an additional &euro;5 million for youth services in 2021. </p>  <p>My Department also funds Growing Up in Ireland (GUI), the national longitudinal study of children in Ireland. The GUI collects data on children and young people across Ireland, which could be analysed to provide further information about the situation of children and young people living in rural areas. The Deputy may be interested to know that under Commitment 59 of &lsquo;Rural Policy 2020&rsquo;, data from the GUI will form the basis of a research report on outcomes for children and young people in rural Ireland that will be commissioned by the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development.</p></reply>

With the country being placed on Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID for a period of six weeks, it is clear that this will be the case for the remainder of the first semester.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, however these measures are very important from a public health perspective in controlling the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  Responding to these issues is a significant matter of concern for myself and for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we are examining how accommodation providers can be encouraged to show greater flexibility to students during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector is already engaging with these issues. I will continue to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation.  The majority of universities have confirmed that students who choose not to take up their accommodation will receive a refund and I have made it clear that I wish to see this principle applied by all universities.</p>  <p>  For students in the private rental market, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances in which students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to continue to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to monitor and report to me on developments on student accommodation issues in order to ascertain whether any further policy response is feasible.</p></reply>

Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which this strategy is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society.</p><p>Addressing the education and training needs of people with a disability, including those with Down Syndrome, will be a primary focus of this Strategy. Over the period of this Strategy, SOLAS commits to expanding on the approach of the fund for students with disabilities which currently only covers PLC provision.  This work will be driven through reform of the funding system and the roll-out of good practice guidelines, including those in relation to universal design for learning. </p><p>The Specialist Training Provider programme is also being reviewed at present and recomemndations arising will be implemented.  This includes measures to increase inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream FET rather than separate dedicated provision. </p><p>The strategic aims of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017&ndash;2021 and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015 &ndash;2024 are embedded with the SOLAS / Education Training Board strategic funding arrangements. This ensures a whole of system approach leading to better outcomes and a requirement on the 16 ETBs to implement measures to increase access and inclusion. </p><p>This year over &euro;900 million will be invested in the FET sector. Over 200,000 people start FET courses each year.  I would encourage people considering availing of opportunities in the FET sector to contact their local Education and Training Board Adult Education Guidance Service to avail of information and guidance on education and training options and relevant supports that are available to potential learners. </p></reply>

The key purpose of the Group is to scope out main issues impacting on learning and engagement by disadvantaged students across all aspects of further and higher education arising from the Covid-19 public health emergency.  The advice of this Group has been important in guiding interventions to support students and institutions in sustaining learning.</p>  <p>  &euro;8million in funding is being provided in 2020 to enable SOLAS establish a Mitigating Educational Disadvantage Fund in the further education and training sector. The fund is designed to increase the capacity of Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and community education providers to tackle any fall off in participation by and certification of disadvantaged learners, particularly those on literacy and basic skills programmes at levels 1-3 of the National Framework of Qualifications.  The fund places a strong focus on community education as a tool to continue to support and engage with these learners.  The fund is also investing in building the digital infrastructure of ETBs and community education providers and the capacity of educators to ensure that online learning can be delivered in a way that meets the complex needs of all FET learners.</p>  <p>  With regard to supports for postgraduate students I have announced an increase in the fee grant from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and will give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. I have also decided to increase the fee income threshold to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500. These changes will take effect from September 2021.</p>  <p>  I have secured an additional &euro;1.5 million to increase the 1916 Bursary Fund (also known as the PATH 2 programme) to &euro;5 million per annum, providing an additional 200 places which will allow the fund to support up to 1,000 of the most disadvantaged students to access higher education. The allocation will also provide for the development of a centralised application system for the bursary scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government has also allocated &euro;50 million to provide once-off assistance to third level students in recognition of the challenging circumstances of the Covid-19 public health emergency.  The details of this package are currently being worked through and a proposal will shortly be brought back to Government. </p>  <p>  A fund for student devices worth &euro;15 million was provided for further and higher education to deal with the impacts of the Covid-19 public health emergency on learners. Funding of &euro;10 million has been provided to the higher education sector and &euro;5m to the further education and training sector. The funding is being provided to eligible Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and ETBs (plus a number of other SOLAS-funded FET providers) in accordance with allocation models agreed with the HEA and SOLAS.  </p>  <p>  There is also ongoing work between my Department and other Departments to resolve the connectivity issues that present for students and learners, particularly those in remote locations.</p>  <p>  The mental health of our students is a priority for my Department, particularly in light of the Covid-19 public health emergency, and the increased mental stress and pressure resulting from it. In this regard earlier this year, I secured an additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs). This is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services. I understand that many institutions are already in the process of increasing their counselling service capacity and more to follow over the coming weeks.  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling services will allow for the development of active outreach to students, and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. </p></reply>

This includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme contains a number of qualifying thresholds for various grant values.

In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  With regard to the income threshold for the special rate of grant, this is adjusted in line with Budget increases to the State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years. For 2020, the threshold has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500. Last year over 21,000 students received the special rate of grant and it is anticipated that a similar number will qualify for supports in 2020. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.

This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains an important commitment to review SUSI eligibility and I fully intend to fulfil this commitment so as to promote access to third level, particularly amongst families with low incomes and communities that are under-represented.</p></reply>

This is to assist them in consistently and collaboratively continuing to adapt to meeting the challenges posed by this pandemic.</p>  <p>  - Practical Guidance for Further and Higher Education for Returning to On-Site Activity in 2020. This guide was prepared on a consultative basis with sector stakeholders and with the assistance of public health expertise. It is intended to provide advice and guidance to the higher and further education sectors as they move to crystallise their return to campus plans, while safeguarding the health and safety of students, learners, visitors and staff.</p>  <p>   This suite is also supplemented by more detailed further and higher education implementation guidelines, developed by the sectors working closely with public health experts.</p>  <p>   The extensive work summarised above undertaken to underpin the operation of the higher and further education system has been based on detailed planning and contingencies by higher and further education institutions, ongoing reporting and more recently the development of Outbreaks Protocols, and their implementation and communication to staff, students and learners.  The scope for continuity of practical skills provision at more restrictive levels is afforded on the basis of this strong sectoral engagement, planning and reporting, ensuring ongoing close alignment with the framework.</p>  <p>   In devising and implementing the framework we have been mindful of being as inclusive as possible.  Accordingly all publicly funded higher education, private higher education (through HECA members) and education and training offered through ETBs, including that offered on a contracted basis is comprehended within the Guidance and therefore can take place within the current restrictions .  Given the statutory remit of SOLAS, Safepass and CSCS/QSCS training are comprehended.  Community based education is also in scope. </p>  <p>   Outside of this, there is a diverse continuum of education and training of varying degrees of duration and formality.  Our basis for engagement with such providers across this spectrum of diverse sectors is very limited and it would be a major undertaking on the Department&rsquo;s part to oversee the work required to give the necessary confidence in their processes and their implementation, sufficient to provide confidence in the provision of practical skills at more restrictive levels. However, it is the Department&rsquo;s view that such education and training taking place outside of the sectors outlined above, falls within the provisions of general Government advice and the HSA Protocols for Returning to Work. </p></reply>

For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was first implemented by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) in March for employees and self-employed people who had lost their employment due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other DEASP payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p>  <p>  Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the Student Grant Scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. However, students in receipt of BTEA may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270. Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). Further enquiries in respect of the BTEA should be referred to DEASP. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains an important commitment to review SUSI eligibility and I fully intend to fulfil this commitment so as to promote access to third level, particularly amongst families with low incomes and communities that are under-represented.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students can apply for supports under the Student Assistance Fund. The fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

This provision remains in force at the current time, however workers with expired cards are advised to renew their cards as soon as possible to prevent a significant backlog accruing with 43,466 cards with an expiry date after the 1<sup>st</sup>March not yet renewed. </p><p>The continued delivery of certification schemes to support health and safety in the construction sector during the Covid-19 period is vital and SOLAS is actively examining alternative delivery methods to identify a solution that is equitable with existing Safe Pass course delivery, in being accessible to all eligible workers, providing real time course participant supports and ensuring assessment integrity. </p><p>The criteria for Safe Pass tutor approval is determined by a tripartite collaborative arrangement comprising construction sector stakeholders and social partners in consultation with SOLAS. The Safe Pass tutor is open to anyone who wishes to apply, as long as they comply with the eligibility and approval criteria, as no deviation can be accommodated. A guide to the Safe Pass tutor application criteria and process is attached.</p><p>In respect of the price being charged for Safe Pass courses, course fees are determined by the Approved Training Organisations (ATOs) who are independent commercial entities.  The maximum number of participants that can attend a Safe Pass course was reduced from twenty to ten participants in line with SOLAS&rsquo; Standard Operational Pandemic Containment Guidelines to allow for the re-opening of the sector.  There is also a &euro;32 fee payable to SOLAS for the processing, manufacturing and distribution of Safe Pass cards which is unchanged and is generally included in the overall price for attending a course.</p><p>  ">Tutor Approval</p></reply>

The future development of Ireland as an inclusive society and a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.   </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options including the existing student contribution and other supports.  </p>  <p>  Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future funding which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability. </p>  <p>  All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of the Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further education. </p></reply>

The vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population.</p>  <p>  A progress review of the National Access Plan, published in December 2018, acknowledges a number of significant positive developments and characterises the first phase of implementation of the NAP as a period of achievement and investment. A major element of both progress to date and the future implementation of the plan has been the increased investment in new access initiatives since the original publication of the National Access Plan (NAP).</p>  <p>  While increases in participation in Irish Travellers are evident in the NAP, there remains a significant challenge in achieving the target in respect of the Traveller target group. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that the numerous initiatives under the strands of The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) funding aimed at increasing Traveller participation will assist in the realisation of the target and enhance understanding of the barriers that exist in respect of access to higher education by Traveller students. Even though the realisation of targets is proving difficult, evidence has shown that the number of Irish Travellers accessing higher education has increased from 35 (2012/2013) to 61 (2017/2018), a 74% increase, since the commencement of this National Access Plan. </p>  <p>  Arising from the progress review published in 2018, the Department published priority actions in the Action Plan for Education 2019 and made a commitment to the development of an action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education.</p>  <p>  While recognising the supports that are already in place to support Irish Traveller Participation in higher education across the education spectrum, the purpose of this action plan is to bring a particular focus of attention and afford particular priority to certain actions.</p>  <p>  The overall objective of the Action Plan is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches across the education spectrum on retention and transitions of Travellers.</p>  <p>  Reporting on the actions commenced in September 2020 and a recent report shows there are dedicated Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) projects that focus on targeting increased Traveller participation in Higher Education.  </p>  <p>  Projects under the PATH strand 1 Initial Teacher Education focuses on targeting increased Traveller participation at primary level through engagement with Traveller community groups and targeted post primary schools, the provision of direct entry places and continuous support for Travellers who have been identified as aspiring to become a primary school teacher.  7 Traveller students registered on a PATH 1 programme as of 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  PATH Strand 2 the 1916 Bursary Fund has supported 39 Traveller students over the last three years. This strand reports a high success rate for students who are Travellers obtaining the bursary.</p>  <p>  Projects under the PATH Strand 3 Higher Education Access Fund also support Irish Travellers in progressing to Higher Education.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to report that the PATH fund has a current investment envelope of &euro;33.9 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands.  Approximately PATH Funding of &euro;1.5m has already been targeted specifically to support Traveller participation in higher education over the first three years of the current National Access Plan.</p></reply>

It may also entitle the applicant to a special rate award, providing all other income received fall under the threshold of &euro;24,500. If the Guardian&rsquo;s payment is paid to someone else, such as a sibling or another family member, the income will not be reckonable, but the applicant will only be eligible for consideration for the ordinary rate of grant unless there is another qualifying payment as per Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2020. </p><p>A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents/ legal guardian from the previous October. Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental/ legal Guardian income.</p><p>Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians is provided, can candidates who are under 23 be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address, Article 21(3) (b) of the Scheme refers.</p><p>SUSI, the grant awarding authority, has advised that the student in question has made no grant application for the academic year 2020/21.

This included an adaptation framework to assist institutions to continuously adapt to meet the challenges posed by this pandemic. </p>  <p>  When the framework was initially published the prevailing public health situation was one that supported a return to on-site learning. However as a result of recent developments the balance between on-site and online provision was adjusted.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as of midnight on Wednesday 21 October all of Ireland has been placed on Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID for a period of six weeks.</p>  <p>  The Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and such education activities cannot be held remotely.  However, all further and higher education institutions should continue to deliver the majority of their classes online. Given the scale and diversity within third-level provision, the higher and further education institutions themselves are best equipped to determine in which circumstances onsite presence is required. </p>  <p>  Examples of activities that may require an on-site presence include, but are not limited to, teaching and research in laboratories, practical and skills-based tuition, scheduled access to libraries and other on-site resources, and provision of necessary onsite support to meet the mental health and welfare needs of students.</p>  <p>  Given the evolving nature of the public health environment, it is not yet possible to provide any guarantee as to the format of the second semester. It is planned to review the position with relevant institutions and stakeholders in the light of experience and the progress of the disease and communicate the position for next semester before the end of the year. </p></reply>

For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>   In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

I understand, based on the information available to me, that in the case of an appeal or amendment which leads someone to obtaining an upgraded result, their random number remains the same. If they are now in a position where they would have received an offer in a previous round - i.e. if their randomly selected number is higher than that of the last person offered- they are offered a place, if it is lower than the last person offered, they are not offered. As such, applicants who have points upgraded as a result of a corrected grade are not disadvantaged. </p><p>If an applicant has an issue with their CAO application that  is not resolved to the applicant&rsquo;s satisfaction, the option to appeal is available. The CAO has an Independent Appeals Commission, to which recourse may be had by applicants who believe that they have been treated unfairly by CAO, and whose complaints have not been resolved by CAO. The function of the Appeals Commission is to ensure that the rules are applied fairly. </p><p>Appeals should be addressed to: </p><p>The Secretary, CAO Independent Appeals Commission, c/o Tower House, Eglinton Street, Galway, Ireland. </p></reply>

They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. Deadlines and procedures  for students to withdraw from chosen courses is a matter for individual institutions and my Department does not have a role in this matter.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, progression, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course. </p>  <p>  Under the progression/previous academic attainment criteria of the scheme, a grant will not be paid to a student for a repeat period of study on the same course, or for a different course at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. </p>  <p>  However, I can confirm that students who opt to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations later in the year and who receive an improved CAO offer on foot of these results will also receive a deferred college offer to start their course in the 2021/22 academic year. If a candidate who has started first year of a course becomes entitled to a higher CAO offer and chooses to accept same in the following academic year, attendance for the first year on the new course would remain eligible for free fees and SUSI funding as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the college attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

This includes their research activities because laboratories have been closed as part of wider campus closures and access to archives, engagement with focus groups, etc., have also been curtailed. </p><p>Consequently, many researchers and research students whose contracts are approaching conclusion are, in effect, unable to complete their work because they do not have the financial resources to continue the work beyond its original completion date. As well as the negative impact on the researchers themselves, this also means that Exchequer funding to date invested in the projects risks being lost because the work is not finished. From the funder perspective, while many have worked with their funded researchers to seek ways around this problem, for example, in the form of no-cost extensions, any use of their budget for costed extensions automatically depletes their future budget availability.</p><p>As part of the &euro;168m Exchequer funding that the Department obtained, &euro;47.7m was secured to assist in the provision of costed extensions to research activities that are at risk because of delays incurred as a result of COVID-19. The amount secured for this purpose reflects discussions that have been held with institutions on the financial ramifications of the pandemic crisis. </p><p>The aims of the funding are:</p><p>- Primarily to assist those researchers and research students whose work has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis, most typically those who are coming to the end of theircontract/ studies by the end of 2020</p><p>- To ensure completion of valuable research work and protection of the Exchequer investments made to date.</p><p>- To protect national research funders&rsquo; future budgets by providing dedicated support for costed extensions and by restoring budgetary levels through institutional reimbursement of any cost extension funding received to date from national funders.</p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has responsibility for the allocation of these monies and has worked with the institutional representative bodies and research funders to coordinate the process. It was agreed that it was in the interest of the researchers and the research ecosystem to develop a coordinated approach at a system level to delivering on the HEA Cost Extension Budget, with no undue doubling of effort. </p><p>The administrative process and computational method of allocating funding to specific institutions is outlined in the attached document. </p></reply>

My Department, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and relevant higher education institutions are dedicating significant investment towards technological university development and progression. </p><p>The administration of funding in support of the development and progression of technological universities is carried out on behalf of the Department by the HEA. In 2018 and 2019 this process was carried out under an annual competitive call for higher education Landscape Funding. Following a detailed assessment of applications and project plans by the HEA, the recommended outcomes were forwarded for Department and Ministerial approval. An external review of projects awarded Landscape Funding during the period 2017-2019 (Landscape Review) has been commissioned by the HEA and is currently being undertaken.</p><p>The report of the TU Research Network (TURN): Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity was published in October 2019.  The report details the case and requirements for a step change in higher education configuration whereby technological universities will be facilitated to assist in the delivery of national strategic objectives for regional socio-economic development, higher education access and research and skills progression The report makes a  series of recommendations for outcomes that will provide a solid foundation for the development of and progression of technological universities. A key recommendation  is for the reconfiguration of the previous Landscape Funding approach by the establishment of a dedicated funding stream to support technological university development.  </p><p>In Budget 2020 Government announced a new Technological University Transformation Fund which would see technological university oriented funding increase by &euro;90 million to over &euro;120 million in total by 2023. Following discussions between the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills the subsequent strategic direction of the TURN process and the design and operation of funding allocations under the new Transformation Fund was assigned to the HEA, subject to policy direction from the Department, in May 2020.</p><p>The HEA convened and chaired two meetings of the TURN group, comprising representatives of the various TU development consortia, TU Dublin, Technological Higher Education Association (THEA) and the HEA,  in May and July to discuss the approach to the design and implementation of the Transformation Fund, informed by the recommendations of the TURN report. It was agreed that a competitive process would not be the best approach to the new Fund, as the TURN report sets out a shared understanding of the issues to be faced in realising the ambition for technological universities in Ireland.</p><p>The HEA held individual meetings with TU development consortia and eligible higher education institutions in June and requested outline proposals, detailing their key priorities for the three year period of the Transformation Fund. The proposals were reviewed by the HEA and discussed by the TURN group in July. The HEA issued correspondence together with a formal submission template and information guide to TU development consortia and eligible institutions in early August. A letter from the THEA and TU Dublin in relation to the new Fund was also submitted to the HEA, indicating mutual support for the outcomes of the TURN Report and reaffirming their commitment to developing an overarching strategic approach to the Fund. A total of eight formal submissions for multi-annual funding support over three years of the Fund (1 September 2020 &ndash; 31 August 2023) were received by HEA by the end of August </p><p>Meetings were held by the HEA with all eligible consortia and institutions providing feedback on their outline proposals. The submissions were appraised by the HEA Executive and discussed with applicants in a series of online meetings in September with regard to:</p><p>Project Relevance;</p><p>- Quality of Proposal and Project Design;</p><p>- Efficiency and Effectiveness;</p><p>- Governance, Financial and Risk Management, including level of co-funding provided by the Higher Education Institutions.</p><p>Overall sectoral requirements across cost categories were also considered in the review of submissions. Final recommendations on funding allocations made by the HEA Executive were discussed by the HEA Finance and Governance Committee and approved by the HEA Board prior to my announcement of the first allocations under the Transformation Fund on 7 October 2020. </p><p>The table under sets out details by project of the allocations under the Transformation Fund in 2020 and under Landscape Funding in 2018 and 2019.  <table>    <tr>       <th>TU   Consortium/HEI</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020*</th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athlone IT   and Dundalk IT</td>       <td>&euro;500,000</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;500,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dundalk IT</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;550,000</td>       <td>&euro;760,000</td>       <td>&euro;1,310,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athlone IT   and Limerick IT</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;2,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;5,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;7,000,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Connacht   Ulster Alliance</td>       <td>&euro;1,800,000</td>       <td>&euro;2,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;5,700,000</td>       <td>&euro;9,500,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Institute   of Art and Design Dun Laoghaire</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;100,000</td>       <td>&euro;100,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Munster   Technological University</td>       <td>&euro;2,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;2,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;8,250,000</td>       <td>&euro;12,250,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Technological   University Dublin</td>       <td>&euro;4,400,000</td>       <td>&euro;3,800,000</td>       <td>&euro;7,250,000</td>       <td>&euro;15,450,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Technological   University for South East of Ireland</td>       <td>&euro;1,005,000</td>       <td>&euro;2,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;5,100,000</td>       <td>&euro;8,105,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IReL (TU   Dublin )</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;1,200,000</td>       <td>&euro;1,200,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EduCampus   (TU Dublin)</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;849,059</td>       <td>&euro;849,059</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HEA   Monitoring</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;120,941</td>       <td>&euro;120,941</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>&euro;9,705,000</td>       <td>&euro;12,350,000</td>       <td>&euro;34,330,000</td>       <td>&euro;56,385,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>*</b>&euro;<i>30million allocation will be disbursed Autumn 2020 and </i>&euro;  <i>4.33million will be disbursed Q1 2021.</i></p><p>In terms of safeguards on allocations, a principle of the policy framework underpinning the Transformation Fund is that funding will be allocated on the basis of assessed capacity and capability and progress evidenced towards technological university designation and in meeting the objectives and ambition set out in the TURN report. To ensure that funding is used effectively, the HEA requires implementation plans from consortia and institutions  setting out clear objectives, milestones and deliverables, aligned to their budgets. All consortia and institutions awarded funding in Year 1 of the Fund will be required to submit revised budgets and work packages, based on the level of funding allocated, prior to disbursal of funds. Funding may be removed or redistributed at the discretion of the HEA, where circumstances change or where sufficient progress on projects is not being made in accordance with project plans. The HEA will hold quarterly meetings with consortia and institutions to monitor progress towards results, as set out in the project plans. Written and financial reports on progress will be required biannually and may be subject to external verification. </p><p>Funding will be released in a phased way over the three-year operation of the Transformation Fund, based on progress achieved against objectives set out in proposal submissions. The findings and any &lsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; from the ongoing Landscape Review commissioned by the HEA will also inform the ongoing management and implementation of the Fund.</p></reply>

The NMCI provides education and training facilities to service the needs of Cork Institute of Technology and the non-military needs of the Irish Naval Service. The Cork School of Music is a unique facility providing state of the art facilities which includes music studios, rehearsal hall, theatre space, recording and dance studios, classrooms and lecture theatres.  </p><p>The Grangegorman PPP project will provide state of the art facilities for the TU Dublin Colleges of Sciences and Health, Arts and Tourism and for the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The East Quad is now expected to be completed in the coming weeks and the Central Quad in Q1 2021.</p><p>With regard to the query around &lsquo;outrun in relation to deviations from the original contract&rsquo;, I am taking this to relate to variations, which can be introduced by the State side or by the PPP company.  The Grangegorman PPP project remains under construction and the outturn in respect of variations is not yet available.  In relation to the CSM and NMCI contracts, the Department has not introduced any variation in recent years.  These are three-way contracts to which CIT is also a party.</p><p>The other information requested by the Deputy is included in the table beneath. Unitary Charge payments cover the cost of construction, finance, maintenance, operation and lifecycle. </p><p>Contracts exist between my Department and the relevant principal contractor, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) responsible for the design, construction and finance of that particular PPP programme, as well as operation of the building in question for the 25 years post construction.

These programmes range in duration from two to four years and lead to qualifications at levels 6 to 10 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  A minimum of 50% of time must be spent in on-the-job training, however the off-the-job training component of the programme can range from remote delivery to one day per week on an ongoing basis or periods of release to training providers as in the ICT apprenticeship or the craft apprenticeships.  In all cases, the apprenticeship contract is set out between the employer and the apprentice.  </p><p>The rates of pay for the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes are agreed by the partners within the relevant sector, or are set out in Sectoral Employment Orders (Construction Sector and Mechanical Engineering Building Services Contracting Sector). Rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. The most up to date rates are attached.</p><p>In the case of the remaining 33 consortia led apprenticeships the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. These apprenticeships span across a wide range of sectors from hairdressing and hospitality to finance and biopharma.</p></reply>

In 2019, Tusla allocated &euro;25.3 million to Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence services, an increase of &euro;1.5 million over 2018. Tusla provided funding and coordination supports to 59 front-line DSGBV service providers, comprising community-based domestic violence services, rape crisis services, and services that provide emergency refuge accommodation for survivors of domestic violence throughout the country.</p><p>My Department provides funding to promote and assist the development of support services to victims of crime, including domestic and sexual crime. In 2019, funding of &euro;1.712m  was allocated to a large number of non-governmental organisations across the State in providing a wide range of supports to victims of crime, including sexual and gender based violence.  These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services.</p><p>My Department also funds the Choices Programme, a uniform national domestic abuse intervention programme for men. This programme is a group work intervention to support and challenge men engaged in domestic abuse to change their abusive behaviour and attitudes towards their partners, while maintaining and supporting the safety and well-being of women and children as paramount. A key feature of the programme is that it also incorporates a separate partner support service that offers one to one support to the partners or ex partners of the men on the group programme. </p><p>I also secured &euro;2.7million in increased funding to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence, as well as support for victims, in Budget 2021. </p><p>Details of the monies paid out to services in 2019 are set out in the table below.

Neither I nor my Department have any function in this regard.  However, to be of assistance, officials from my Department contacted the Coroner concerned, and were told that the average wait time for post-mortem reports is 4 to 6 months, and possibly longer if more detailed tests, such as toxicology are required. </p>  <p>  Individual families should contact the relevant Coroner for further details.

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee;</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller in accordance with SI 289 of 2006; and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.  As part of the application process the Local Authority must provide assurance that they will act in the data controller role.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the new Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future</i>, commits the Government to reviewing the legal and organisational framework governing community CCTV.  To that end, I am progressing a range of new Bills relating to Garda governance and policing powers. It is my intention to repeal the provisions currently contained in Section 38 of the 2005 Act, and to replace them with provisions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill.  I hope to bring the general scheme of that Bill to Government for approval very soon.  </p></reply>

We will introduce a new Family Court Bill and develop a dedicated family court system. The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system. This is a commitment in the programme for government and includes resolving disputes in a less adversarial manner. </p>  <p>  My intention is to reform the family justice system to create a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities and will:</p>  <p>  - Provide access to specialist supports.</p>  <p>  - Encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings.</p>  <p>  - Streamline family law court processes to make them more efficient and more user-friendly, while encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution.</p>  <p>  A Family Justice Oversight Group has recently been established in my department which, in addition to department officials, also includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Group held its first meeting in September and has been tasked with agreeing a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system having regard to international best practice, in parallel with the establishment of the dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill.  </p>  <p>  A work plan is currently being developed by the group and I understand that one of the tasks to be undertaken is  consideration of the various recommendations contained in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality Report on Reform of the Family Law System including those specifically referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am informed that this system was based on a model recommended by the then Inspector of Prisons, the late Judge Michael Reilly. A copy of this Complaints Policy can be found on the website of the Irish Prison Service.</p><p>All prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness. As you will appreciate, complaints vary in nature and seriousness - for example, some may relate to conditions of accommodation, quality of food or access to services while other complaints can be more serious such as allegations of assault, mistreatment or intimidation. </p><p>The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a 'Category F' complaint. </p><p>Further information on this system, including these categories, is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link:  </p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, or ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or any other conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service.  I understand that Category A complaints are investigated by persons outside of the Prison Service. </p><p>The introduction and implementation of a new Prison Service Complaints Policy is a priority for the Irish Prison Service and I am advised that work is well advanced on measures to implement the new Policy, which includes a fully integrated IT complaints system to streamline the management of all complaints along with a new appeal process.  </p><p>More specifically, I understand that a new Complaints Unit has been established in the Irish Prison Service and that training is currently being rolled out to prison staff.  Amendments required to the Prison Rules, 2007 are also currently being finalised.

There is an ongoing proposal under discussion within the EU Working Party on Transport for an EU Directive to discontinue seasonal clock changes. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal would have particular implications for the island of Ireland, especially in the context of the UK&rsquo;s pending withdrawal from the European Union.  A wide ranging public survey, stakeholder engagement and a public opinion poll were conducted in the context of developing Ireland&rsquo;s position on this proposal. </p>  <p>  The results demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of respondents would not be in favour of any change that would result in two time zones on the island of Ireland, which would inevitably lead to increased difficulties for business and the general public.</p>  <p>More generally, in the context of the EU proposal, Ireland&rsquo;s position, along with a number of other Member States, has reflected concern that the proposal could reduce synchronicity and result in a &lsquo;patchwork&rsquo; of time zones across the EU, thereby causing unnecessary confusion in the Single Market.  Ireland has supported a call for a full impact assessment of this proposal to be carried out prior to any final decisions being made at EU level.</p></reply>

Problems have emerged in neighbouring jurisdictions in relation to knife crime and the Government is determined to ensure similar problems do not develop here in Ireland. Although the problem is not of a similar scale here, any stabbing incident can cause irreparable physical harm and have potentially tragic consequences. That is why a comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant for knives and offensive weapons. I am advised a substantial number of convictions have been secured in the courts over the past number of years for possession of a knife or other similar article. Sentencing policy is kept under ongoing review by my Department. </p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in reported crimes against persons in the first two quarters of this year versus last year and according to the Central Statistics Office, in the first quarter the "assault causing harm" category fell 23.9% and in the second quarter it fell 16.9% when compared with the same periods in the previous year. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating an assault reduction strategy for 2019 to 2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults in public, including use of knives. This strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early investigation and proactive high-visibility approach. It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness. The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and operationally appropriate. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives. At an operational level, garda&iacute; proactively target public disorder and antisocial behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hotspots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Firearms and Offence Weapons (Amendment) Private Member&rsquo;s Bill (PMB), this Bill passed second stage in the D&aacute;il on 2 October 2019. However, this Bill subsequently lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and was not restored.</p>  <p>  I will shortly commence a public consultation on the development of a new Three Year Strategy for the Department of Justice. I would of course welcome any submission the Deputy would like to make in relation the priorities which should be set as part of this Plan.</p></reply>

The latest regulations, in force from 22 October are the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 - S.I. 448 of 2020. These Regulations supersede relevant previous Regulations.</p>  <p>  S.I. 448 of 2020 requires persons to stay in their home and not to leave it without reasonable excuse. This restriction would appear to preclude attendance at the type of drive-in bingo event as described. </p>  <p>  With regard to the current law, there is a prohibition under section 26 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 from holding a lottery without a valid lottery permit or licence. The current provisions applying to lotteries (draws, raffles, bingo, etc.) are sections 27 (Garda Permits) and 28 (District Court licences) of that Act. It is not obvious from the Deputy's question as to which provision applies with regard to the organisation in question. </p>  <p>  Section 27 does not refer to how the lottery is to be conducted, and thus would seem to allow for the issue of a Garda permit for the holding of drive-in bingo as the lottery activity &ndash; once every six months for the same beneficiary.

This is subject to all other aspects of their application being in order and each case is considered on its individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the current difficulties with procuring passports from Venezuela and an applicant should include a note to that effect when they apply. Applicants from Venezuela should utilise the online registration renewal system where appropriate. My Department can assist such people by issuing a six month permission pending receipt of the new/extended document.  </p>  <p>  On 18 September 2020, I announced that immigration and international protection permissions due to expire between 20 September 2020 and 20 January 2021, are automatically renewed to the 20 January 2021. The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. This measure also applies to Venezuelan nationals who are legally resident here and they should continue to apply in the usual manner to have their permissions registered, specifying any issues they may have with producing a valid passport as outlined above.  </p></reply>

The projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which are funded directly by my Department. </p><p>GYDPs seek to divert young people who have become involved, or are at risk of becoming involved, in crime/anti-social behaviour away from future involvement with the Criminal Justice System. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old young people in communities where a specific need for the service has been identified. On average, the Garda Youth Diversion Projects engage with between 3,500 and 4,000 young people across the state in any one year. </p><p>Currently there are some 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects. The intention is to further develop the service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and where necessary the foundation of new projects.</p><p>Further, the projects are being developed to provide family support to the parents of young people participating in the projects and are undertaking early intervention and preventative work. The role of the projects in relation to harder-to-engage young people is being enhanced and extended as part of the evolving Youth Justice system.  </p><p>My Department is supporting ongoing development of practice in GYDPs through the Action Research Project led by the University of Limerick. The Action Research Project works directly with front-line Youth Justice Workers from local projects to develop interventions and best practice. Based on initial outcomes from the Action Research Project and evaluations of a number of pilot projects, it is intended to develop proposals to expand the existing services, to ensure national coverage and a stronger focus on difficult issues such as the hard-to-reach cohort. </p><p>These issues are addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which is due to be published before the end of the year.</p><p>The specific information relating to DMR North, as requested by the Deputy, is outlined in the table.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to further note that no Garda Youth Diversion Projects in DMR North were closed between 2009 and to date in 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th><div> Garda Division</div></th>       <th><div> Project</div></th>       <th><div> Garda District</div></th>       <th><div> Year Opened</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North </td>       <td>Woodale</td>       <td>Coolock</td>       <td>1997</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>Keep</td>       <td>Coolock</td>       <td>2000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>BYB</td>       <td>Ballymun</td>       <td>2007</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>Jets</td>       <td>Coolock</td>       <td>2007</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>Donnycarney</td>       <td>Santry</td>       <td>2016</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>North Bay</td>       <td>Balbriggan</td>       <td>2016</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DMR North</td>       <td>North Fingal (Balbriggan)</td>       <td>Balbriggan</td>       <td>2016</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This figure does not include minors who are not required to attend a ceremony. Approximately 400 minor certificates recently issued by post with 292 minor certificates to be issued in the coming period.  </p><p>COVID-19 has unfortunately prevented the holding of our large-scale citizenship ceremonies, which is impacting the processing of applications. I was pleased to announce on 22 October 2020, that I have approved a solution to replace the ceremonies with a sworn affidavit on an interim basis and the priority drafting of a statutory instrument to implement this change. My Department will issue the naturalisation certificate on receipt of a statutory declaration. This will alleviate the current holdup of applications that have been approved and awaiting a ceremony to swear their allegiance to the Irish State thus enabling these applicants to start their new lives as Irish citizens. It remains my  intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. </p><p>The following table sets out the certificates of naturalisation issued between 1 January 2014 and 30 September 2020, by nationality. It includes both adults and minors and covers all application categories.  In total, there were 72,349 certificates issued between these dates. In addition to those listed in the table, there were a further 51 countries where a total of 260 certificates of naturalisation were issued to 10 or fewer of their citizens. No further breakdown is provided as the small numbers involved may lead to the identification of the individuals concerned. <table>    <tr>       <th>Nationality </th>       <th>Certificates

This included Statutory Instrument 276 of 2017 which amended Rule 27 of the Prison Rules 2007 and which provides a statutory entitlement to prisoners for a minimum of two hours out-of-cell time daily. Therefore,  all prisoners have a right, save in exceptional circumstances, to a minimum of 2 hours out of their cell with an opportunity for meaningful human contact.  </p><p>The means by which this Statutory Instrument is implemented is contained within the Irish Prison Service Policy on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement, which is publicly available on their website. </p><p>This 2017 Statutory Instrument brings the Irish prison system into line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as &lsquo;Mandela Rules&rsquo;) in respect of solitary confinement.</p><p>On occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population. This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her. In addition, under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 a Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  In addition a smaller number of prisoners may have their regimes restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).  </p><p>The Prison Rules also provide that the imposition of a restricted regime is closely monitored by the Irish Prison Service and the status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed. The Director General of the Irish Prison Service chairs a high level group to examine the measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of two hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.</p><p>As the Deputy may appreciate, in light of the COVID - 19 pandemic, a number of measures have been required to be undertaken by the Service in order to protect our prison population. These are taken in line with Public Health advice and have resulted in an increase in the number of prisoners whose regime has been restricted. The Deputy will appreciate that for obvious medical and infection control reasons, those prisoners suspected of infection are placed on a more restrictive form of regime while the testing process is completed.</p><p>All prisoners newly committed to prison are placed in quarantine for ten days before being transferred into general population. This measure is in place in order to reduce the risk that a new committal, who might be incubating the virus, could spread Covid-19 into the general prison population. Furthermore, any prisoner who informs staff that they are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 is immediately assessed by prison healthcare staff who arrange for the prisoner to be isolated and tested. Any prisoner who has had contact with another person who has been tested for Covid-19 and is awaiting results is also isolated from the prison population, while they are tested and awaiting the results of said test.</p><p>On 9 April 2020 the Irish Prison Service, in line with Public Health advice, introduced a regime wherein all prisoners over the age of 70, or prisoners with specific serious underlying medical conditions, were cocooned in the prisons in which they were detained. Prisoners over the age of 70 or deemed as medically vulnerable were removed from free association, but could associate in dedicated areas with one another. The practice of cocooning ceased in prisons on 29 June 2020, however, prisoners formerly cocooning are still offered the option of a restricted regime at their own request.</p><p>It is important to note that prisoners who are in isolation and quarantine continue to have access to a wide range of services and facilities within the prison including phone calls, psychology supports, tuck shop, chaplaincy services and television and I am advised that particular efforts are being made to ensure that prisoners can communicate with their families on the outside, through increased provision of telephone services. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that for obvious medical and infection control reasons, those prisoners suspected of infection are placed on a more restrictive form of regime while the testing process is completed.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to note that the collation of a Quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners commenced in 2013.

The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.

I am informed that the introduction of the application fee had an immediate positive effect on the quality and completeness of applications which is ultimately to the benefit of applicants.

This includes a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process for these children.</p><p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. Following a referendum in 2004, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, amended Section 6 of the 1956 Act.</p><p>The changes came into effect on 1 January 2005. As of that date, a person born on the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been legally resident on the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the reckonable residence.</p><p>Access to the labour market, third level education and other public services are a matter for each of the relevant Departments. Access to these services on the same basis as EEA nationals can be achieved through acquiring Irish citizenship. The State is obliged to provide all children with free primary and post-primary education. Access to free third level education for Irish born non-citizen young persons is dependent on having the appropriate permission to remain in the State. Those young persons who do not qualify for free third level education may still be eligible for EU fee rates. Access to employment is also dependent on having the necessary permission, the same as for any other migrant in the State.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents meeting specified criteria to regularise their status within 18 months of the formation of the Government, bearing in mind European Union and Common Travel Area commitments.</p><p>A policy paper on the matter is being drafted by my Department at the present time, which will include an assessment of international best practices. Previous regularisation schemes, such as the 2018 Student Scheme and earlier such schemes, will also be considered in any future policy. Consultations on any policy proposals will also need to take place with relevant stakeholders including with other relevant Government Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their own and their family's status. In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. The Immigration Service of my Department examines each case of an undocumented or illegal person in the State on a case-by-case basis and is considered on its individual merits.</p></reply>

The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,500 for a first offence and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.</p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between 7 and 30 days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.</p>  <p>  With technology that facilitates video calls being commonplace in the conduct of business in a broad spectrum of contexts, there do not appear to be any practical impediments to vendors verifying the age of purchasers who purchase alcohol from their homes.  The purchase must be completed from their home in advance of delivery.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 report.  It took the view that sales of alcohol products which have been ordered by telephone or text messaging and which are paid for on delivery do not comply with licensing law requirements and are, therefore, illegal. The Group recommended that the Garda&iacute; target &ldquo;dial-a-can&rdquo; and similar delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the licensing acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland and, as matters currently stand, I do not propose to introduce new legislation in this area.  However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased substantially. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers and new revenue streams for small rural pubs or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation.  It is in that context that I remain open to reviewing the situation should compelling objective evidence emerge indicating that a further examination of the legislation regulating these matters is warranted.</p></reply>

The Protocol advises that employers must provide for physical distancing across all work activities and this may be achieved in a number of ways including conducting meetings as much as possible using online remote means. Where face to face meetings are absolutely necessary, the length of the meeting and the numbers attending should be kept to a minimum and participants must maintain physical distancing at all times.</p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place, including information in relation to Work under the different Levels, is available at .</p></reply>

Responsibility for enforcement of food legislation is managed through service contracts between the FSAI and a number of competent authorities, also known as &lsquo;Official Agencies&rsquo;.  These official agencies include the HSE; Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Local Authorities; and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities (LAs), acting on behalf of the FSAI, are responsible for food law enforcement required under EU food law at certain food businesses with the controls carried out by the Local Authority Veterinary Service (LAVS).</p>  <p>  The annual funding provided by my Department to the FSAI is inclusive of funding for the LA service contracts.  While funded by my Department, the FSAI is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p>  <p>The FSAI and the County &amp;amp; City Management Association (CCMA) have been engaging for some time regarding the funding and effective delivery of the service. The current LA service contracts with the FSAI are due to expire on 30th November 2020 and the Authority has been working closely with all parties to ensure that a system of food safety controls is in place in LA supervised premises from 1st   December 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department has agreed to provide additional funding, on a once-off basis in 2021, to the FSAI in respect of the LAVS service contracts for 2021, which in turn is being made available to the LAs by the FSAI.  This is in recognition of the need to provide more stability to the food business sector that might be impacted. The additional funding is subject to a number of conditions relating to the development of a new model of service delivery and related service matters.</p>  <p>On 28th October 2020, the CCMA responded to the FSAI&rsquo;s offer of additional funding confirming that the LAs are prepared to extend the current service contracts until 31st   December 2021 in accordance with the terms offered by the FSAI. This arrangement will ensure continuity of current agreements with no impact on abattoirs or food businesses while a new service contract model is being developed.</p></reply>

This approach will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people.</p>  <p>  There are two components to the health diversion programme whereby a person in possession of drugs, determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be for personal use, on the first occasion would be referred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a mandatory basis to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for a health screening and brief intervention. On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution. </p>  <p>  An implementation, monitoring and evaluation group, chaired by the Department of Health, is implementing the health diversion programme. The Group is developing proposals to commence implementation of the programme on an administrative basis in a number of locations throughout the country.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, a review of the programme will take place following the first full year of  implementation, to ensure that it is meeting all of its aims.</p>  <p>  I am committed to a health-led approach for possession of drugs for personal use. I look forward to the commencement of the health diversion programme in 2021. I have no plans to change the law in regard to the possession of drugs for personal use.  </p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputies should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the Living with Covid Plan provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. </p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It could be noted that holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. </p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed, as the Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach met with the leaders of the Catholic Church last week to consider the range of issues relating this matter.</p><p>Finally, the Deputies will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b></b>they recommence: <i></i></p></reply>

My Department secured &euro;100m in additional funding in Budget 2021, which will significantly increase the disability services budget to around &euro;2.2 billion next year.  This signals the Government is serious in its commitment to make a difference in the lives of people with a disability, in line with the Programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the investment outlined in Budget 2021, the Strengthening Disability Services Scheme, which Minister Rabbitte and I announced last week, will make &euro;20 million available on a once off basis in the current year to support voluntary disability service providers engaged in the Transforming Lives Reform programme. Details of this programme and information on how service providers can apply are available here.</p>  <p>  The &euro;100 million in new funding in 2021 will be targeted at five key areas: children&rsquo;s services, day services, community supports, residential services, and integration. I will now ask the HSE, in preparing its National Service Plan, to examine how these key priorities can be progressed in 2021 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services</p></reply>

This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p>  <p>  The Department has set up a working group with drug and alcohol service providers to develop a 'Framework for the Restoration of Drug and Alcohol Services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. The working group has identified issues on which guidance and supports are required. </p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss continued support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs. I confirmed my approval of additional funding to support the resumption of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  I will be announcing the details of this additional funding shortly. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions, as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community.  </p>  <p>  This season, approximately 2 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  However, the HSE is satisfied that sufficient vaccine has been ordered to vaccinate all those in the at-risk groups. This expansion is the most possible in 2020, in particular as the international market for vaccines is under considerable pressure this year and it is not possible to procure additional quantities at this stage.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  The Government has decided that Ireland will move to level 5 of the framework. </p><p>At Level 5, up to 25 mourners can attend a funeral.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. </p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.</p></reply>

In that context,  there would not appear to be any issue with the use of this term in the constitution and the Deputy&rsquo;s attention is  instead directed to the purpose, constitution, main object and governance codes of the company.</p><p>Finally, I would like provide assurance that the legal framework, which is being developed to protect the State's investment in the new maternity hospital, will ensure that health services at the new hospital will be provided without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, there will be no question that any services can be prohibited based on religious beliefs or the ethical code of the hospitals concerned.</p></reply>

This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. Government then makes decisions about the measures which are to be put in place.</p><p>Various aspects of public health measures are provided for in regulations. These include the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport (SI 244), mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain retail outlets (SI 296) and various aspects of the public health restrictive measures outlined in the 5 Level Framework including restrictions on travel, events and gatherings, and the operation of certain businesses and services as has been the case since the beginning of the pandemic. Current level 5 regulations are set out in Statutory Instrument Nos. 448 and 449. </p><p>Statutory Instruments related to the Covid-19 pandemic are available here:  </p></reply>

I also recognise the potential hardship that might arise for students on placement due to COVID 19 such as maintaining part time employment, increased travel and additional accommodation costs. </p><p>Student nurses and midwives are not paid for clinical placements in years 1-3 of their studies and supernumerary status is critical for learning in complex environments.  Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Circular 9/2004, that provides:</p><p>- an accommodation allowance up to &euro;50.79 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from their normal place of residence.</p><p>- a refund of travel expenses.</p><p>Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts. </p><p>In the immediate term my Department is reviewing the current accommodation and travel allowances that apply to this year&rsquo;s 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup>year students on clinical placements, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such placements.</p><p>The revision is expected to conclude shortly, and I look forward to bringing forward proposals thereafter.</p><p>Concerning 4<sup>th</sup>year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of these student who are on rostered work placements. It is very important to me that the training element is protected for students. This includes those scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and those due to commence rostered work placement in 2021. These 4<sup>th</sup>year student nurses and midwives on rostered work placement are paid at the approved rate, that is &euro;22,229 on an annual basis for psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines. </p><p>I am open to examining what other measures that can be put in place to protect and support student nurse and midwife education and welfare at the present time. My priority is to ensure placements continue so long as it is safe to do so. In that regard, my Department is engaging with the HSE and higher education bodies on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Separately, and for the longer term, my Department is also reviewing the accommodation and travel allowances for students on clinical placements that should apply from the academic year commencing Autumn 2021 and onwards. This review is expected to conclude at the end of this month, and I look forward to examining the outcome of this review in due course.</p><p>As the cost of paying students is a service matter, I have referred the matter to the HSE and asked that it respond directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

It acknowledges that caf&eacute;s, restaurants and pubs and close-contact personal services, are the world of work for so many in our communities. </p><p>Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  </p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, unfortunately, this means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.</p><p>Regarding the impact of the closure of these businesses on the overall R number, I have been advised by the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG), that it is not feasible to provide reliable estimates of the impact of very specific interventions.  In order to do this, a series of assumptions would need to be made in relation to the number of close contacts that occur in a setting, the number of close contacts that occur in the population as a whole, the relative risk that such close contacts lead to infection, and the effect of mitigating measures such as the use of PPE. Small changes in these assumptions lead to very different outcomes in terms of impact upon the R number.  <i></i></p><p>For your information, technical notes on the approaches used to estimate effective reproduction number (Re) or time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) are published on the Department of Health website   <i></i></p><p>Further information on all levels of <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>is available at: .  <i></i></p></reply>

However, some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis. A variety of transport solutions are pursued in each CHO area, including: </p>  <p>  - Travel training by service providers or families to enable public transport to be used upon commencement of their day programme where applicable.</p>  <p>  - Service providers provide transport where available capacity exists.</p>  <p>  - Local transport e.g. Local Link, private bus transport providers and taxis, funded via a combination of service provider, HSE funding, service user contribution, and / or combined funding to meet the transport requirements identified.</p>  <p>  - HSE local funding, where available, is utilised to support service providers to provide transport solutions for service users.</p>  <p>  - Families agree to transport service users to service providers.</p>  <p>  In general, disability service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass. </p>  <p>  The HSE was successful in securing Dormant Account monies to fund a project to map all Disability transport routes nationally, via information gathering by Disability Service providers and HSE Services who provide transport. The outputs of this study will be used as a basis for considering how to improve access to disability services and how to best make use of local resources.  </p>  <p>  The availability of safe transport is essential to the delivery of Day Services across the country. Reduced capacity on vehicles will mean more journeys to facilitate those that require a transport service to access their day service location. </p>  <p>  As services resume it will be necessary to identify how transport can continue to be provided in as safe a manner as possible and strictly within social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions. Transport providers will have to demonstrate that their transport services are safe and that all COVID-19 precautions have been established and observed. The guidance includes general guidelines and a risk assessment matrix on safe transport. While family members are to be encouraged to transport the individual to Day Services, this will not always be possible depending on the family circumstances and in these cases, there will continue to be a reliance on bus transport.</p>  <p>  Transport is a theme of the National Disability Inclusion strategy, and Action 104 of this strategy states: 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  As part of the mid-term review of the NDIS, there will be a focus on promoting collaborative approaches to cross-cutting issues, and the working group on transport (Action 104), was convened by the Department of Justice and Equality in February 2020, with a focus on identifying opportunities for collaboration between transport and other public bodies to promote greater mobility for people with disabilities. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is now at Level 5 of the Plan.  Under Level 5, people are asked to stay at home at all times unless they have a reasonable excuse for travelling. The relevant regulations, as set out in SI No. 448 of 2020, provide for a number of exemptions to this requirement to remain at home, including travel to and from work, where work involves providing an essential service; to attend education; to attend medical appointments and collect medicines and other health products; to travel to attend disability day services; to travel to attend a court; for food shopping; to take school aged children to permitted training; for vital family reasons, such as providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people; for farming purposes; to attend a wedding or funeral or to visit a grave; and to take exercise within 5 km of home.</p><p>Details of public health measures in place at Level 5, including domestic travel and essential services are available at </p></reply>

It has a statutory obligation to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery and to protect the public.</p><p>Further details about the NMBI language standards are available on its website.  Those who do not meet the required minimum test scores are not eligible to apply for registration; however, they can retake the test.</p><p>To register as a nurse or midwife, NMBI requires those applicants from  EU/EEA and Non-EU/EEA countries who do not complete their training programme through English to demonstrate English language competency by achieving the approved score in a recognised English Language Assessment.</p><p>In April 2020, the NMBI applied amendments to its English language requirements for nurses and midwives who did not complete their qualifications through English. These amendments, which are the result of a review that began in 2019, better relate to requirements for day to day practice while ensuring that the appropriate standard of English language is still maintained. They also bring Ireland into line with other international health regulators who have also recently reviewed language standards. The NMBI intend to further review the amendments after 12 months. </p><p>In regard to visas, information provided by the Department of Justice and Equality states that applications for an employment visa on the Atypical Working Scheme for Nurses are processed in accordance with visa procedures. Applicants must satisfy English Language Competency and Qualifications guidelines of the HSE and NMBI. Employment visas applications are generally turned around quickly, but some types take longer than others. Carers, unless in a private domestic setting, are on the ineligible list of occupations and therefore will not qualify for a work permit.

There is no vaccine or viral therapy treatment available yet, so this means that consistent, comprehensive communication around personal preventive behaviours and public health guidance is crucial to keep people safe at this time - especially at periods in which the virus is circulating at high levels within the community. </p>  <p>  To that end, my Department has held press briefings from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure that experts in public health are to the fore when informing the public about the disease&rsquo;s pattern and progression within Ireland. This gives journalists from a broad cross section of the media the opportunity to ask key figures such as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer questions on a regular and consistent basis, in order to counter the potential spread of misinformation in the media. </p>  <p>  Representatives of the NPHET are also regularly available for media interview across all major media outlets such as RTE, Newstalk and Virgin Media News, in order to answer questions and provide response to any concerns posed to them by media or the general public in relation to the pandemic and Ireland&rsquo;s response to it.</p>  <p>  In each daily press release issued by my Department, links are provided to the COVID-19 dashboard, where detailed information on the spread of COVID-19 and key indicators in the community are available.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.</p></reply>

The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions, and must exercise within 5km of home. No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional elite sports and senior inter-county gaelic games and horse and greyhound racing, which may continue behind closed doors. All other training activities should be individual only. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise. It is appreciated that these measures are difficult, but they have been put in place to protect public health.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that recreational hunting is not among the exemptions provided for under the current regulations - the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020)(S.I.

This unprecedented additional amount of money signals our determination in government to fund an expansion of, and improvements in, our health and social care services. Included in the extra money is &euro;650m for testing and tracing and &euro;650m for provision of PPE.  And in the coming year, a robust and comprehensive testing and tracing system will be critical to the effective functioning of our health services and the broader economy.</p>  <p>  These additional resources will provide capacity for over 100,000 tests per week, supply PPE where needed and continue into 2021 all of the necessary Covid-19 action plan measures that have been put in place since March.</p>  <p>  Testing and contact tracing continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, and to ensure we have a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation, central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19, a provision of &euro;650m has been made in Budget 2021. This relates to all associated costs &ndash; swabbing, laboratory tests, contact tracing and relevant logistics. Some of this funding is held centrally by Government in the contingency fund.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a worldwide shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the health service responded quickly and developed guaranteed supply lines to ensure adequate PPE was available in 2020, along with ensuring the stock levels were increased.</p>  <p>  Recognising the unprecedented uncertainty faced by policy-makers in planning for the progression of COVID-19, a PPE Estimation Model was developed to provide for a transparent, dynamic, evidence-based estimate of required PPE for the Irish healthcare system. &euro;650m has been provided in 2021 to meet the costs associated with maintaining appropriate levels of PPE stock to ensure all healthcare professionals have the protection they need. In addition, investment in indigenous manufacturing and supply will have wider economic benefits for the country.</p></reply>

To cater for this new testing pathway both a working and steering group were set up to define a clear and concise process for schools testing. This group has developed a testing pathway, templates for data collection and communication materials with the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  As of October 27th, 731 schools have had/are having some testing completed based on a Public Health Risk Assessment.  From the 731 schools that had mass tests, an additional 531 detected cases have been identified over and above original cases. 17,603 students and teachers have been involved in mass testing.</p>  <p>  HSE Public Health Doctors recently met with education stakeholders including the teacher unions. The HSE acknowledged the incredible effort made in all school communities throughout the country to operate in a Covid-19 safe manner. The measures that are in place are robust, and the safety of staff and children is of paramount concern.</p>  <p>  Evidence shows that those efforts have proven very successful. Clearly the increase of Covid-19 cases in the community does pose a challenge as there will be more cases in schools as a result, but it is important to note that schools are not amplification settings for cases of Covid-19. Testing data from schools is reassuring, with a positivity rate of 2.3% of close contacts across all school sectors.</p>  <p>  The rise in cases overall in the community and in the positivity rate has challenged the HSE and Public Health Departments considerably over the last weeks, and this has had an impact on response times in schools. The HSE is aiming to have processes strengthened by the time schools return after the midterm break. Support teams are being put in place across the HSE's Departments of Public Health with this in mind.</p></reply>

The revised guidance followed a substantial review process. </p>  <p>  This guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.</p>  <p>  The new guidance provides a clear and open framework for visiting. It provides guidance on the measures required to be adopted by nursing homes and by visitors to mitigate risks associated with visiting. It also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that each individual nursing home provider has legal responsibilities under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 with regard to facilitating visits. A provider may determine that restrictions may be required if in their opinion visits would pose a risk to residents. It is therefore a matter for each provider to consider the arrangements they have in place in relation to visiting. The HPSC&rsquo;s guidance has been developed to assist providers in this regard. </p>  <p>  As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p>  <p>  On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.  </p>  <p>The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.  </p></reply>

A Letter of Determination will issue to the HSE to advise it of its funding allocation for 2021 and requesting it to prepare a Capital Plan on this basis.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery and management of healthcare infrastructure and will develop a Capital Plan, guided by national healthcare strategies, policies and Government priorities and having regard to the available funding and the number of large national capital projects currently underway.

All capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p>  <p>  The capital funding for health in 2021 will contribute to the delivery of modern health facilities and equipment to improve and expand service provision and capacity across the country, both key aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>A range of essential services are permitted to continue under Levels 4 and 5. This includes construction and development activities and specifically the following is permitted - the supply and delivery of maintenance and repair services to businesses and places of residence (including electrical, gas, oil, plumbing, glazing and roofing services). In this regard, painting and decorating can continue to operate as an essential service. However, in the spirit of current measures and efforts to significantly suppress the virus, householders would be expected to pause more routine non-essential jobs until after current restrictions are lifted.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.

It is already interoperable with the Northern Ireland App and since the 19th October, it is interoperable with Germany and Italy.  Ireland has been one of the first countries to participate in the EU cross-border interoperability service and further cross border interoperability will be available as other EU countries join the service.  Use of contact tracing apps and cross-border interoperability allow the acceleration of contact tracing procedures by alerting close contacts earlier. Interoperability enables this on an all-island basis and across participating member states, making the app&rsquo;s role in contact tracing vital to the continued fight against COVID-19 and supporting the reopening of society and business.</p>  <p>  One of the latest COVID Tracker App improvements is the inclusion of a &lsquo;PAUSE&rsquo; function so that healthcare workers can temporarily switch off proximity detection whilst on shift and wearing PPE. It is intended that this functionality will avoid the risk of false alerts.  Furthermore, an additional improvement is the provision of infection rate data at Local Electoral District Area level.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the COVID Tracker App.  I wish to thank the Deputy for her suggestion which has been passed to the Health Service Executive for consideration.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere.</p><p>On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This new Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation . The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>Under Level 4 of the Plan, essential retail and businesses which are primarily outdoors are permitted to open and therefore at Level 4 garden centres are permitted to open. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail is permitted to open and all other retail is closed and therefore at Level 5 garden centres are not permitted to open. </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. The latest public health advice on these matters is available at the links below and is updated on a regular basis:</p></reply>

The revised guidance followed a substantial review process. </p>  <p>  This guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.</p>  <p>  The new guidance provides a clear and open framework for visiting. It provides guidance on the measures required to be adopted by nursing homes and by visitors to mitigate risks associated with visiting. In circumstances where the level of the virus circulating in the community is high, there is greater risk to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings and people. It is of great concern that heightened community transmission will bring further unwitting transmission of COVID-19 into nursing homes impacting on those most vulnerable to the virus.  In response to the overarching situation, the Government took the decision to move the whole country to level 5 of the Framework of Restrictive measures from 21st October. This was a significant decision. The purpose of these measures is to respond to the current situation, break the chains of transmission and reduce the amount of the virus circulating in the community. With regard to visits to nursing homes, the public health advice in relation to Level 5 is clear &ndash; that visits should be suspended aside from critical and compassionate circumstances.</p>  <p>  The advice also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p>  <p>  On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers  with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the current provision of treatment to patients, the HSE has advised the Department that hospitals continue to offer appointments and treatments to patients. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital. This is frequently updated by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings. </p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my Department that they have approved 8 outpatient rheumatology initiatives for funding in 2020.

An organisation may get a grant of up to 1% of their 2019 HSE funding.</p>  <p>  There are three strands under which eligible providers may apply for funding.

To this end, a Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations was established in December 2019 as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on Sl&aacute;intecare and other policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.</p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network. </p>  <p>  The Forum met twice in December and January, but further meetings scheduled for March 2020 and May 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Chair recently convened a sub-group of the Forum to act as a planning group to assist him in planning and, where appropriate, progressing the work of the Forum over the next three to four months. The Planning Group met online for the first time on 29 September 2020 and the Group will meet again in November and December. It is planned to recommence full Forum meetings in early 2021.</p>  <p>  More generally, many of the Independent Review Group Report&rsquo;s recommendations dovetail with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and are being considered in that context. In addition, some recommendations are being taken forward in the context of the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A Five-Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector in Ireland 2019-2024&rsquo;.</p>  <p>With regard to Section 39 organisation pay restoration, a Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached in October 2018 provided for pay restoration in relation to 50 pilot organisations in the first instance. Pay restoration for these bodies commenced in April 2019 with further payments due in October 2020 and October 2021 as appropriate. The agreement recognised that some of the remaining Section 39 organisations were also likely to have pay restoration issues and a process to address these issues commenced in 2019 under the auspices of the WRC. Despite the engagement which took place, it has not yet been possible to reach agreement.  This is because management cannot provide a timeframe or a commitment to fund this part of the process. </p>  <p>  The HSE are currently costing this next phase of pay restoration and are expected to complete the exercise in the coming weeks. Engagement will take place with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform once the HSE has completed this work. Health sector management remain committed to the process.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. </p>  <p>  The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Needs and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness or a disability and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. The Expert Group also concluded that a persons means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that since 1st December 2018, the medical card earnings disregard for persons in receipt of Disability Allowance was increased from &euro;120 to &euro;427 per week and applies to the assessment process for both single persons and to family assessments. This measure gave effect to one of the key recommendations of the Make Work Pay for Persons with Disabilities Report and enables persons in receipt of the disability allowance to have a higher level of earnings and still retain their medical card.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since June 1st 2017, all children for whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid automatically qualify for a medical card without assessment.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the referral of the patient to another facility for treatment, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.   </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is approximately double the amount administered last season.  The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter.  This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up.  In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended.  However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received.  950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season.  The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution.  The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks.  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. </p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country.  A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community.  Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of increasing the level of uptake of the flu vaccine this year, GPs and pharmacists are incentivised not only to deliver vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek out relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.  In addition to the fee of &euro;15 for administering the vaccine to those in the at-risk group and &euro;20 for the administration of the nasal vaccine to children, GPs and pharmacists will be eligible for an additional payment of &euro;100 for every 10 patients in the at-risk categories vaccinated and &euro;150 for every 10 children to whom the LAIV is administered.</p></reply>

Public health guidance was specifically developed to underpin the safe resumption of services, and this guidance was published in July. </p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location.  This means that, when day services re-opened they re-opened at approximately 40% capacity.  However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. </p>  <p>  The government will be investing an additional &euro;100 million in new initiatives in 2021, bringing the total disabilities budget to around &euro;2.2 billion.  Regarding day services specifically, this additional investment will build the capacity of our adult disability services nationally, and will increase day services by one day a week, for those whose services were reduced due to COVID-19.  It will also support around 1,700 young people who leave school and training programmes in 2021. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to the &euro;7.5 million being made available to support the resumption of day services which I announced in September. </p>  <p>  The HSE gathered data at the end of September on the quantum of services currently being provided to individuals, and this will act as a baseline to track additional service levels.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The legislation necessary to establish the Tribunal, the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 passed through the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 23 July 2019. </p>  <p>  It was originally intended that the CervicalCheck Tribunal would be established by the end of March 2020.  However, establishment was delayed due to the outbreak of COVID-19.  A further delay arose in June when previously nominated members were no longer in a position to take up roles in the Tribunal. </p>  <p>  There are considerations compelling the urgency of establishing the Tribunal, including legitimate issues raised by the 221+ patient support group when the Tribunal was delayed previously, such as in respect of the statute of limitations, that without the Tribunal eligible women would have no other option to make a claim outside of the courts, and the criticalness of any further time delay for some of the women eligible.</p>  <p>  Concerns in respect of the CervicalCheck Tribunal and how CervicalCheck cases would be dealt with were raised with me by the 221+ patient support group at a meeting on 2 September 2020.  I responded to the issues raised by the group at those meetings in my letter of 20 October, in which I also informed the group of the Tribunal&rsquo;s establishment day, and in further letters of 27 and 28 October.  Further meetings about the Tribunal and CervicalCheck cases were held with the 221+ group on Friday, 23 October 2020 and Monday, 26 October 2020, and I am engaged in ongoing constructive correspondence with the group. </p>  <p>  Although the Tribunal was established on 27 October 2020, all further actions with regard to establishing the Tribunal, including the appointment of the members to properly constitute the Tribunal, have been paused as agreed pending the 221+ group&rsquo;s consideration of my responses to their concerns.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to addressing the 221+ group's concerns in respect of the Tribunal.  The only practical impact of the establishment of the Tribunal on 27 October 2020 is that the nine-month period for making claims runs from that day, however this can be extended if necessary.</p></reply>

Similarly, inadequate ventilation in nonhealthcare settings has been shown as a contributing factor in outbreaks of highly infectious airborne diseases like measles and TB. COVID-19 is a new disease, and the effect of ventilation on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is still unclear. </p><p>There is currently no strong evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is spread through aerosol transmission via HVAC systems. However, there is evidence that COVID-19 outbreaks are more commonly associated with crowded indoor spaces, and that poor ventilation may increase the risk of transmission in such settings by facilitating the spread of droplets over longer distances. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that in September the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre published a guidance document which provides an analysis of the current literature examining the association between ventilation and COVID-19. The document also provides recommendations, based on the literature, for commercial and public buildings, including with regard to mechanical ventilation. The guidance also includes specific recommendations for school settings. This guidance can be found at the following link:<i></i></p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. Restrictions on domestic travel apply at Levels 3, 4 and 5 of the Plan. No restrictions on travel apply at Level 1 and 2 of the Plan.</p><p>At all levels of the Framework, and in all regulations which give effect to measures agreed by Government, provision is made to ensure that parents can continue to access their children. The regulations make clear that it is permitted to travel across county borders (Levels 3 and 4) and further than 5km (Level 5) for these purposes. Travel is permitted for parents of a child; guardian of a child; and a person who has a right of access to a child. </p><p>Those who share parenting or custody arrangements are now also permitted to form a support bubble should they wish to and further details on support bubbles is available here: <i></i></p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  Half of the total doses of LAIV (nasal) vaccination for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 years has been distributed to GPs and pharmacists. The LAIV vaccination programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has now been received and is in the process of being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.</p></reply>

It also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p><p>On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. </p><p>Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and well-being.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.</p><p>Current guidance and the recommendations of the Expert Panel report seek to enhance standardisation and consistency in service delivery, including in areas such as visiting and communication.</p></reply>

This will include an integrated mix of services delivered through Community Health Networks working closely with integrated older person teams, frailty teams, utilisation of new rehabilitation beds and enhanced home care with an additional 5 million hours for 2021.   An additional &euro;150 million is being provided for home support in 2021.  A new National Home Support Office will be established along with commencing the roll out of interRAI, a comprehensive standard care assessment tool.  The intermediate care beds are intended to enable people to avoid going into acute hospitals or when admitted to acute hospitals to enable them to go home more quickly following a period of rehabilitation. These repurposed and additional beds will be located within the 9 Community Healthcare Organisations. </p>  <p>  Additional funding allocated to older persons in Budget 2021 will be dedicated to enhancing dementia focussed services and supports. The investment in dementia will increase access to in-home day care, further develop the Dementia: Understand Together initiative, provide 11 more dementia advisers, improve the national network of memory technology resource rooms, deliver an acute hospital dementia and delirium care pathway, and implement the national clinical guideline on the appropriate use of psychotropic medication in people with dementia.</p>  <p>  Family carers provide selfless and dedicated care to their loved ones, and the Government recognises that the caring role can be challenging, particularly in current circumstances. Our family carers deserve support to enable them to continue caring with confidence. &euro;2 million has been allocated to provide a more standard package of supports to family carers in every region, known as the &ldquo;Carer&rsquo;s Guarantee&rdquo;. The specific measures to be introduced in the package for family carers will be determined through service level agreements between the HSE and relevant service providers.</p></reply>

The models used by IEMAG provided  possible scenarios showing what might happen if the trends at the time continued. These scenarios are not forecasts or predictions, but instead offer a variety of &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios, showing the rate of infection if reproduction number has a particular value due to underlying population behaviour.</p><p>At the time the letter of 15 October was written, R was estimated at 1.4 and cases were growing at 5-6% per day, giving a doubling time of 12-14 days.  The growth rate and doubling time for hospitalisation and ICU occupancy were also similar (growth rate 3-4%,doubling time 17-22 days).  The letter explicitly stated that the modelling did not take into account the likely impact of Level 3 measures. It is likely that if Level 3 measures had not been implemented across the State, the case numbers indicated in the modelling would have been reached and (ii) visits between households had not been banned, nor Level 4 measures applied to Border Counties, case numbers now would be intermediate between 1,200 per day and the 1,800 projected if the reproduction number had remained at 1.4.</p><p>The IEMAG modelling also showed that for each sustained reduction in daily case numbers of 100 per day (say from 1000 cases per day to 900 cases per day) IEMAG predict that over the subsequent month alone this would prevent at least 100-140 hospitalisations, 15-20 admissions to ICU and 10-20 deaths. If case numbers are reduced from 1200 per day to 200 per day, over the subsequent month this will prevent at least 1000-1400 hospitalisations, 150-200 admissions to ICU and 100-200 deaths.</p><p>Technical notes on the approaches used by IEMAG are published on the Department of Health website ( ). These are in line with best practice and associated references are available in the published technical notes.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p><p>This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. </p><p>A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. </p><p>With regard to critical care beds, at the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p><p>Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.</p><p>Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.</p><p>Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.&rdquo;</p><p>In relation to community capacity, a home first approach is being taken founded on a community model of care that puts in place end to end care pathways to deliver care to people at or near home. This will include an integrated a mix of services delivered through Community Health Networks working closely with integrated older person teams, frailty teams, utilisation of new rehabilitation beds and enhanced home care with a new 5 million hours for 2021.  The intermediate care beds are intended to enable people to avoid going into acute hospitals or when admitted to acute hospitals to enable to go home more quickly following a period of rehabilitation. These repurposed and additional beds will be located within the 9 Community Healthcare Organisations. </p><p>This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement  which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. </p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. The process is due to be completed soon, and a panel put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. In the meantime, the Department has approved a temporary HSE arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals pending the finalisation of the national procurement process.</p>  <p>  The negotiations in the event of a surge are ongoing.</p></reply>

In some cases, services are delivered directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE). However the majority of organisations providing services for people with a disability are funded by the HSE, on a contract for services basis, underpinned by Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004. Service Level Agreements are set out between the HSE and the individual organisations. Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers have independent boards, who govern the organisations concerned and any deficits accruing are the responsibility of these organisations.</p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. Budget 2021 provides for an unprecedented level of investment in disability services, with an investment of &euro;100m for new initiatives in 2021. In addition to this, &euro;20 million once off funding is being made available in 2020 for disability voluntary service providers engaged in the Transforming Lives Reform programme. Criteria for dispersing this funding is being finalised.</p>  <p>  In the context of COVID-19, the HSE has provided significant supports to Section 38 and Section 39 organisations providing disability specialist services. Through the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), the HSE is actively engaging with any Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers who are experiencing financial challenges, including access to cash acceleration, where appropriate, to maintain continuity of service provision where cash flow issues arise.  Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19. Specific action has been taken at my request and that of Minister Rabbitte, to relieve Disability service providers of the necessity to achieve a 1% efficiency target in 2020. </p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to work in partnership with all service provider organisations to ensure the best level of service possible is provided to people with a disability, and their families, within the resources available. As the Deputy's question deals with organisations providing services to the HSE, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

To this end, a Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations was established in December 2019 as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on Sl&aacute;intecare and other policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.</p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network. </p>  <p>  The Forum met twice in December and January, but further meetings scheduled for March 2020 and May 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Chair recently convened a sub-group of the Forum to act as a planning group to assist him in planning and, where appropriate, progressing the work of the Forum over the next three to four months.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p><p>Children's Health Ireland (CHI) have advised the Department that CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street had to defer all non-emergency spinal operations in accordance with NPHET advice. They have been phasing up services on an incremental basis since June. CHI have confirmed that spinal surgery continues to be identified as a service prioritisation.</p><p>Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) requirements have also had a material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, significantly impacting on the overall capacity and operational activity levels for inpatient / outpatient settings. As a result, CHI is working closely with the HSE in relation to planning and delivering care in the context of the overall service continuity plan for the health system.  </p><p>To the end of September 2020, CHI has carried out 218 scoliosis procedures. Of these, 103 were spinal fusions and 115 were other spinal procedures. This is 21% behind activity levels for the same period last year, when 277 spinal procedures were carried out, of these 128 were spinal fusions and 149 were other spinal procedures.  </p><p>Additional initiatives are being explored to increase access to scoliosis treatment. CHI is working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh to transfer additional patients who meet the clinical criteria for treatment at Cappagh and in conjunction with the NTPF, sourcing additional theatre space in private hospitals. Officials from my Department engage on an on-going basis with representatives from CHI and HSE officials to monitor scoliosis services, waiting lists, and activity levels.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years, and are not being delivered through the schools-based programme as not all eligible children are of school age. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. </p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.

A structured, in depth review of the NDP is to be carried out as set out in the Programme for Government to align the priorities identified in the Programme for Government with the associated resourcing requirements. The objective is to have the NDP review concluded by Summer 2021 and to have ten-year capital ceilings out to 2031 alongside five year rolling Departmental capital ceilings and priorities.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery and management of healthcare infrastructure and will develop a Capital Plan, guided by national healthcare strategies, policies and Government priorities and having regard to the available funding and the number of large national capital projects currently underway. In drafting this plan, priority must be given to meeting contractual commitments. A Letter of Determination will issue to the HSE to advise it of its funding allocation for 2021 and requesting it to prepare a Capital Plan on this basis. The Department will engage proactively with the HSE over the coming weeks prior to the submission of the proposed capital plan. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Capital and Property Steering Committee appraises all project submissions to recommend the selection of projects for inclusion in the Capital Plan, subject to funding availability. All capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p>  <p>  The capital funding for health in 2021 will contribute to the delivery of modern health facilities and equipment to improve and expand service provision and capacity across the country, both key aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

This will fund additional beds and the enhancement of mental health teams including in Child and Adolescent Mental Health services, Adult Crisis Resolution Teams; expansion of specialist Clinical and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy programmes; Peer Support and Bereavement Coordinators, and the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment approach. </p><p>In addition to the above, &euro;15 million will assist with evolving challenges arising from Covid-19. In this context, the number of step-down beds will be increased and extra resources will be provided for community mental health teams. Reconfiguration of mental health facilities,  in line with Mental Health Commission recommendations and the enhancement of digital mental health supports will also take place. </p><p>The remaining &euro;12 million, of the additional &euro;50 million, will help address existing level of service costs, including placements for those individuals whose needs cannot, for various reasons, be met within the public mental health system. </p><p><i>Sharing the Vision</i>promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have more timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State, without discrimination. This builds on the intent of <i>A Vision for Change</i>and<i>Sl&aacute;intecare</i>. <i>Sharing the Vision</i>is expected to be implemented over a ten-year period, with associated timeframes in respect of individual recommendations detailed in the policy.</p><p>My priorities now are to ensure that the new National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC), envisaged under <i>Sharing the Vision</i>, commences its work as quickly as possible, and that the additional funding for mental health in Budget 2021 is progressed in the context of finalising the HSE Service Plan for next year, thus facilitating continued improvement across our mental health services.</p></reply>

These staff will also enable an expansion of the capacity in our health system to ensure its resilience to future surges in demand. </p>  <p>  In order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and to meet workforce demands, several initiatives were undertaken to expand the workforce to ensure adequate staffing levels. These measures have allowed the health workforce to increase by 4,292 whole-time equivalents from the end of February to the end of September this year. While this increase in the workforce was necessary to provide support to the immediate healthcare needs caused by the pandemic, a larger and more permanent expansion of the workforce is underway through the Winter Plan and Budget 2021.  This expansion is necessary to support the resilience of the services in the face of COVID-19 but also to ensure that our healthcare system is resourced to meet the healthcare needs of the population far into the future. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>In addition to core HSE activity, the NTPF have advised my department that they have also approved 8 Hip-Replacement Insourcing initiatives and 14 Hip-Replacement Outsourcing initiatives for funding so far in 2020, which will facilitate treatment for over 1,200 patients on hip replacement waiting lists. </p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning the waiting list for hip replacements, is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>Total IPDC Waiters for Hip Replacement by Hospital by Wait Time Band as at 24/09/2020 <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Total</th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-9 Months</td>       <td>9-15 Months</td>       <td>15-18 Months</td>       <td>18 Months +</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Beaumont Hospital</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>10</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Crumlin</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Temple St</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>6</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown</td>       <td>21</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Croom Orthopaedic Hospital</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>91</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway University Hospitals</td>       <td>101</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>207</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilcreene Regional Orthopaedic Hospital</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>10</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny University Hospital</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>26</td>       <td></td>       <td>6</td>       <td>89</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo University Hospital</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>29</td>       <td></td>       <td>15</td>       <td>86</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh</td>       <td>307</td>       <td>26</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>333</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Our Lady's Hospital Navan</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>16</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>104</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo University Hospital</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>13</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Small Volume Hospitals</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>20</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St. James's Hospital</td>       <td>19</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>9</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tallaght University Hospital</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>35</td>       <td></td>       <td>8</td>       <td>146</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Kerry</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>21</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>67</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Waterford</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>8</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>1086</td>       <td>265</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>117</td>       <td>1512</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.</p><p>Measures such as those introduced at level 5 are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect what we know are our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  The Government is committed to ensuring a balanced and proportionate response to COVID-19 in finding ways to implement public health measures in response to the pandemic in a way that is fair, reasonable and proportionate. </p><p>Since the beginning of this crisis, the Government has developed a greater understanding the transmission of COVID-19, gained insight into the people that it poses the greatest risk to, developed testing and tracing protocols, and become part of a worldwide effort to generate vaccines and drug therapies to counter the virus. </p><p>We know that COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. We also know that COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  </p><p>Therefore the most important way to stop the spread of Covid-19 is for everyone to adhere to the current public health measures, such as good hand hygiene, physical distancing, cough and sneeze etiquette, wearing a face covering, avoiding crowded situations, and not attending work when symptoms appear.  </p><p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, testing and contact tracing has been and continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response. The development of a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation has been central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19 since the outset.  </p><p>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is another key part of the response,  and the health service responded quickly to a worldwide shortage and developed guaranteed supply lines to ensure adequate PPE was available throughout 2020, along with ensuring the stock levels were increased for the future.</p><p>As new scientific evidence becomes available, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE continues to publish and update guidance documents for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in both healthcare and non-healthcare settings, which are available at the following link:</p><p> </p><p>As I am sure you can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the decisions necessary to protect everybody living in Ireland from its effects is constantly evolving. The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), by the Department of Health and by the Government. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-03a.4021.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020110300157#WREEEE05200"><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty. Waiting list data collated by the NTPF is one indicator of the level of demand for hospital services, including ophthalmology appointments and cataract procedures. The NTPF have advised my Department that at the end of September there were 5,013 patients waiting for a cataract procedure across more than 10 central sites. The attached spreadsheet provides detailed information on the sites that currently hold a cataract waiting list, as well as the number of patients waiting for the procedure by time-band. </p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2017, with the number of patients awaiting a procedure down 68% since July 2017. At the end of September 2020 there were 1,380 patients waiting over 9 months compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 waiting over 9 months.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the HSE and NTPF to monitor waiting times for scheduled care and identify areas where access to services can be improved. In this context it is important to recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic this year. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most routine scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the NTPF is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>Cataract Waiters by Hospital <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Amount</th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-9 Months</td>       <td>9-15 Months</td>       <td>15-18 Months</td>       <td>18+ Months</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway University Hospitals</td>       <td>472</td>       <td>76</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>548</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny University Hospital</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital</td>       <td>1118</td>       <td>231</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>1403</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nenagh Hospital</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>101</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital</td>       <td>1026</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1159</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo University Hospital</td>       <td>338</td>       <td>294</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>736</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Small Volume Hospitals</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>108</td>       <td>13</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>121</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St. Vincent's University Hospital</td>       <td>165</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>12</td>       <td></td>       <td>215</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Limerick</td>       <td>164</td>       <td>112</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>328</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Waterford</td>       <td>131</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>93</td>       <td>337</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>3633</td>       <td>987</td>       <td>185</td>       <td>208</td>       <td>5013</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In particular, I fully acknowledge that community pharmacy has played a pivotal role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>It is recognised that community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate the worries and concerns of the population around continuity of medicine supply in the face of great uncertainty. This has been a period of unprecedented difficulty for the country and pharmacists have been at the forefront of the response.</p><p>The existing GMS pharmacy contract dates from 1996 and I accept that it is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training. Patient safety and value-for-money considerations have also assumed increasing importance. </p><p>Accordingly, the programme for Government contains a commitment to commence talks with pharmacists on a new contract which will enhance their role in the delivery of healthcare in the community. </p><p>The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion, should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.  </p><p>My Department officials and the HSE initiated work earlier this year to prepare for engagement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on contractual reform. However, the disruption and reprioritisation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic meant that this work could not be progressed in a meaningful way. It is anticipated that talks will commence in 2021.</p><p>In the context of Covid-19, there has been regular engagement with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU)throughout the past number of months and a significant number of contingency measures have been put in place under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Amendment Regulations, 2020, intended to relieve the pressures on community pharmacies and General Practitioners. There has also been recent engagement with the IPU on pharmacists&rsquo; participation in the extended flu vaccination programme. </p><p>The HSE has established a contingency planning working group with the IPU and Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. The Group&rsquo;s primary role is to examine the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency. </p><p>This working group also represents an opportunity to discuss the strategic direction of the profession which will be valuable in the context of contractual reform in 2021.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports and exercise are central to our well-being and are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. </p><p>You will be aware that in response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, Ireland has moved to level 5 of <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-1</i>9. This means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.</p><p>At level 5, gyms and leisure centres are closed and no exercise or dance classes are permitted. Individual training only is allowed and people must exercise within 5km of home. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise.</p><p>The Government recognises that there are many aspects of normal life that have been altered by the emergence of COVID-19, and the response that has been required. It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted - such as exercising in gyms, but also eating out, attending church, travelling abroad freely - are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>The Government's guidelines for indoor gatherings and exercise and sporting events at all levels of the Plan are available at: . Level 5 guidance from Sport Ireland is available at:  .</p></reply>

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE uses rapid tests in key clinical settings, such as in our hospitals for emergency and surgical care.  These are rapid PCR tests which give results in short timeframes, for example less than an hour. As part of the HSE&rsquo;s testing and tracing plan, it is trying to increase the number of these available as there is significant international demand and supply challenges. These tests only work in very small numbers so are not appropriate for large scale community testing.</p>  <p>  Many of the rapid non-PCR Covid tests reported in the media, which purport to offer a test result in minutes (for example antigen tests) lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare.  However, this issue continues to be monitored by WHO, ECDC, HIQA, and the HSE Laboratory taskforce.</p>  <p>  The HSE believes that antigen and other types of testing, such as saliva testing, may well have a role in testing of asymptomatic people. It is constantly monitoring the sensitivity of these tests to ensure that where deployed they will be of appropriate quality and sensitivity. Again, this will not replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. </p></reply>

However, the HSE is required to undertake the recruitment of staff through open, competitive, and transparent recruitment campaigns. Recruitment to the HSE is subject to the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA). This regulatory framework provides that recruitment to the HSE must observe the following five recruitment principles: </p><p>- Probity </p><p>- Merit</p><p>- Best Practice </p><p>- Fairness </p><p>- Transparency </p><p>The HSE is not able to exclude nursing home staff from applying for positions or prevent them from taking up offers of employment within the HSE for prolonged periods of time; it would be a breach of its Recruitment Licence to do so.  It is, however, ultimately a personal choice of any individual to determine whether s/he wishes to apply for employment within the HSE.  Many factors will influence such a decision and those who are successful in recruitment competitions are entitled to take up those roles when offered positions.</p><p>It is notable, however, that the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, in its report, stated that &ldquo;<i>the pay rates and overall working conditions of, at least, some staff in the private sector was raised as a concern by several contributors. Some of these lowly paid workers seek employment in more than one nursing home to augment their income, a circumstance that, can potentially pose a serious risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission from one facility to another.</i>&rdquo; The Panel went on to recommend that staff employed by a nursing home should be precluded from working across multiple sites and adequate single-site employment contracts should be put in place to support this. </p><p>The Department has recently written to the sector representative body requesting information on the number and percentage of nursing homes that have put arrangements in place regarding contracts for staff in line with the Panel&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>Earlier this year a Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme was established to provide financial support to private and voluntary nursing homes to contribute towards COVID-19 related costs. Some &euro;92m has been made available this year, and following Budget 2021, an additional &euro;42m has been secured for the Scheme, which has now been extended to the end of June 2021.</p></reply>

The rates of levies have not fundamentally changed or increased since its evolution into An Bord Bia in 1994 and stand at &euro;1.90 per bovine, 25c per sheep and 35c per pig.</p>  <p>  These levies are charged at time of slaughter or at point of live export. The fundamental principle is that of equality in that they apply to all primary producers of these animals without exception. </p>  <p>  The funds generated enable and permit the advertising and promotion operations of Bord Bia to carry out its activities and particularly with regard to the Bord Bia Quality Assured product, which carries the &ldquo;Q mark&rdquo;. The statutory levies provide the necessary matching industry sector funding for promotion campaigns carried out by Bord Bia. This is a requirement of the EU State Aid Regulations which Bord Bia, as a State Body, has to comply with. </p>  <p>  In regard to the possibility of reconstructing these levies as voluntary contributions, in the first place, that would require an amendment to the Bord Bia Act, and secondly, issues  would need to be considered with regard to the collection of such contributions, the principle of equal applicability, and potential State Aid implications.</p>  <p>  In regard to accountability, I wish to assure the Deputy that there is visibility of the income generated by the levies by way of their inclusion in the Bord Bia Annual Accounts which are lodged with both Houses of the Oireachtas and published on the Bord Bia website. In addition, Bord Bia's governance structure includes farming organisation representatives on its main Board and sub-Boards.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have asked my Department to review the current levies system with a view to considering if statutory amendments are required.</p></reply>

Teagasc agricultural colleges reopened in September with COVID measures implemented for the safety of learners and staff. Course delivery is based on a hybrid model with practical instruction being delivered face to face and theory being delivered online in line with developments elsewhere in the education sector. </p>  <p>  It would appear that, as Teagasc fall under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc are not eligible for inclusion in funding from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science generally or in the context of specific COVID 19 grants made available by that Department through the HEA and SOLAS to &lsquo;higher and further education&rsquo; providers under their remit.  That Department is at present considering how best to support 3rd level students with the &euro;50m fund announced in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is currently making the case for the inclusion of Teagasc in the &euro;50 million fund announced by the Department of Further and Higher Education to provide financial assistance to third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this group, and consequent increases in online learning. </p></reply>

These individuals have been elected on the recommendation of the current Chair of the FAC and have been selected with regard to their particular expertise on issues such as environmental regulation, silvicultural issues and appeals processes.  Agriculture Appeals officers will be deployed to sit on these committees also.  Two additional persons with planning expertise have also been contracted to assist members of the FAC.</p><p>The FAC will therefore have 4 committees sitting in the month of November.  The question of whether hearings are oral or non-oral is a matter for the Committee.</p><p>It is a matter for the FAC alone to determine the scheduling of appeal hearings as the Committee is operationally independent of my Department.  The FAC has, I understand, scheduled 70 hearings for November.  It will be a matter for the FAC to report on their own progress and they update their decisions weekly at:</p><p>I believe that the provisions in the Act will greatly improve the overall system with more timely decisions on licences under appeal being made by the FAC.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to provide greater transparency and to enhance participation by the public in the decision-making process.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been developing the FLV for past few months and this work is nearing completion.  The Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, commenced on 6th October 2020 made provision for the publication, personal information in relation to forestry licence applications, including submissions received.  This piece of legislation was crucial to the project.</p>  <p>  It is the intention to launch the FLV in three phases.</p>  <p>  Phase 1, will show site information for forestry licence applications received from 1st January, 2018 . We expect to launch this phase in mid-November, once system tests are completed.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 will provide the user with access to application information and supporting documentation for the licence.  This documentation will include applicant names and addresses, along with business names and contact information.  </p>  <p>  My Department takes very seriously its obligations regarding data protection and the GDPR regulation.  Officials of my Department are liaising with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the FLV project.  It is essential that applicants and others are made aware of and understand that their personal data will be visible the public, like local authority planning portals.  Considering the importance of this element of this project, I cannot give a firm timeline on when Phase 2 will be launched.  However, my ambition is to make it available by end November.  </p>  <p>  Further, documents will only be displayed for applications received from the launch of Phase 2.  For applications already in the system, applicants and others would not have been made aware nor would they have consented to their information being published.  The summary details of these projects will be viewable and interested parties may request the associated documents from the Department.</p>  <p>  Phase 3 will enable the making of a submission on a forestry licence application, online, including facilitating payment of the submission fee.  This phase will likely go live in early 2021. </p></reply>

My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid, and to allow marts to continue to operate.</p><p>I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.</p><p>On 19<sup>th</sup>October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21<sup>st</sup>.</p><p>The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of this Government is to protect lives and to protect public health, while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.</p><p>Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20<sup>th</sup>October, that all marts may continue to conduct sales, but using online platforms only. My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. There are no plans at present to allow in-person sales at livestock marts while Level 5 restrictions are in place.</p><p>Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.</p><p>This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation, and we are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.</p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  On Saturday 24<sup>th</sup>October, the online sales companies reported to my officials that, at one stage, that day more than 40,000 people were logged in to online mart sales.  The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to mention the wide range of supports for businesses which the Government has put in place to help them through Covid.  Agrifood businesses, including marts, are eligible for these supports, which are set out on the Gov.ie website.</p></reply>

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.</p>  <p>  There are also delays associated with the appeals process. The Deputy will be aware of the recent enactment of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2020, which amends the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2010.  While no formal analysis of the potential for job losses has taken place, I know from engagement with stakeholders and from the submissions received during the public consultation on the Act that the current difficulties could have serious impact on jobs in the sector.  The Government gave commitments to reform the planning and appeals processes as set out in the Programme for Government and this Act is the result of this commitment.</p>  <p>  I have moved quickly to resource the FAC to realise the provisions as set out in the Act and have appointed 3 Deputy Chairs along with 2 ordinary members.  Agriculture Appeals officers will be deployed to sit on these committees also.  Four persons with planning expertise have also been contracted to assist members of the FAC.   The FAC will therefore have 4 committees sitting in the month of November., which will greatly increase the number of appeals dealt with.</p>  <p>  My Department also has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.</p>  <p>  I believe that a combination of a better resourced Forestry Appeals Committee, along with our systematic approach to the licensing backlog, will result in an increase in the number of licences issued to allow for planting and felling. This approach is already yielding results, with the highest volume of felling licences this year issued in October at some 750,000 m3.</p>  <p>  I am committed to tackling the issues facing us and will put all efforts into maintaining a steady flow of licences to the sector. I know the importance of the sector to jobs in rural areas and will do all that I can to support its continued contribution to the rural economy.</p></reply>

In 2018 and 2019, China was the fifth largest market for Irish agri-exports. According to the latest trade statistics from the CSO, the total value of agri-exports to China between January and August 2020 was over &euro;586 million. In the same period, beef exports of 14,590 tonnes were worth almost &euro;48 million.</p>  <p>  With regard to a possible agreement on sheepmeat exports, my Department, in cooperation with the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, continues to pursue the finalisation of a bilateral protocol with the Chinese authorities. However, the precise timeframe for signing the protocol and granting market access is ultimately a matter for the importing country.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I have had one meeting to date with the Chinese Ambassador on 30 September, also attended by my colleague, Minister of State Martin Heydon, T.D.  and Department officials. During the meeting, I highlighted the growing strength of the agri-food trade between Ireland and China in recent years. We discussed the potential for expanding economic cooperation, through ongoing dialogue and the importance of a collaborative approach in dealing with trade-sensitive issues.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.</p><p>A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats under Statute and was intended to give effect to the measures announced by the then Minister. As stated above, this Policy Directive provided that vessels over 18m LOA (Length Overall) will be excluded from trawling activity inside six nautical miles, including inside the baselines, from 1 January 2020. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. An unapproved judgement was issued on 31 July 2020 and the key points to come out of that Judgement is that while the applicants did not succeed on four of the five grounds of challenge, the challenge was made against the entire Policy Directive 1 of 2019 and was successful.</p><p>The findings on the grounds of challenge were: </p><p>1.  The Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was not ultra vires, </p><p>2.  The Directive did not impinge the applicants constitutional rights.</p><p>3.  Given the impact on the applicants there was a particular duty on the Minister to provide a fuller explanation and engage in further talks with the applicants. On this ground the applicants succeeded.</p><p>4.  The policy directive was not disproportionate to what was to be achieved.</p><p>5.  The Policy directive did not breach EU law.</p><p>On 6<sup>th</sup>October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p><p>The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p><p>I am currently considering, on an urgent basis, the implications of the judgment in consultation with my legal advisors.</p><p>I should advise the Deputy that I am committed to the sustainability of fishing in Irish waters and the commitment made in our Programme for Government that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and pair trawling be prohibited inside the six-mile limit.</p></reply>

The Council now has a political mandate to hold trilogue negotiations with the Commission and the European Parliament with a view to reaching overall agreement.  It is important to note that the final shape of the CAP Reform Package will not be clear until this overall agreement has been achieved.</p>  <p>  A key feature of the new CAP is that there must be an increase in green ambition, including through the introduction of eco-schemes for the environment under Pillar I.  EU Agriculture Ministers have proposed that eco scheme budgets will be ring fenced at 20% of the direct payments budget.  The scheme, while mandatory for Member States, will be voluntary for farmers. Farmers will access the eco-scheme funds by undertaking additional actions and practices that are beneficial for the climate and the environment, beyond basic conditionality requirements.  Member States will design schemes based on their own analysis of needs, but indicative examples of eco-schemes suggested by the European Commission include practices like precision farming, agroforestry, and organic farming.</p>  <p>  Member States will have to prepare national CAP Strategic Plans setting out their planned interventions, and these must include targeted spending on climate actions that demonstrates a higher environmental ambition compared to the current period. Member States will have flexibility to shape their national plans based on their own SWOT which will allow Ireland the possibility to develop schemes to meet our own analysis of needs.</p>  <p>  My Department is considering all potential scheme options.  There has been ongoing consultation with all stakeholders, including the CAP Consultative Committee, on the proposals and I can assure the Deputy that this will continue as the national CAP Strategic Plan is developed.</p></reply>

This year, the UK is attending these consultations as a Coastal State for the first time.  The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, negotiates with the UK and the other Coastal States.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has exclusive competency to negotiate fishery agreements on behalf of the EU Member States.  The Commission operates under a mandate set by Council and any agreement is formally adopted by Council.  Member States attend the formal Plenary meeting.  Regular co-ordination meetings through the Council Working Party are held during the negotiations where the Commission updates the Member States on issues/progress and the Member States set out their positions and respond to issues as they develop.  Ireland, as always, is represented at the Coastal State negotiations by officials from my Department with scientific support from the Marine Institute.  Industry representatives attend the Plenary meetings and are consulted on an ongoing basis by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Coastal States consultation for Blue Whiting concluded on 19 October with an oral agreement for all the Coastal State parties to set the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2021 at 929,292 tonnes, based on the advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and in line with the long-term management strategy for the stock.  This represents a cut of 20% in the TAC.  The long-term management strategy contains an annual TAC change limitation of +/-20%.  Without this limitation, the reduction for 2021 would have been approximately 28%.</p>  <p>  The consultations on Atlanto-Scandian Herring concluded on 21 October with an oral agreement on setting the TAC for 2021 at 651,033 tonnes, based on the ICES advice and the long-term management plan for the stock.  This represents an increase of 24% on the 2020 advice.</p>  <p>  The consultations on Mackerel took place on 26 and 27 October and concluded with parties reaching a consensus on setting the 2021 TAC at 852,284 tonnes, in line with the ICES advice based on the Maximum Sustainable Yield approach.  This represents a reduction of 7.57%.</p>  <p>  The Coastal State consultations will continue in the coming weeks to finalise the Agreed Records of the consultations.</p></reply>

The available bluefin tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990's.  At the time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve reducing the shares of those EU Member States that do have quota and for whom Bluefin Tuna is an important commercial fishery.</p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch.  This by-catch quota is also available to other Member States in the European Union.</p>  <p>  While obtaining a viable commercial quota for Bluefin Tuna is unlikely in the short to medium term, during 2018 negotiations on the new management plan for Bluefin Tuna in the East Atlantic, Ireland was successful in introducing a clause allowing countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data.  A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019.  </p>  <p>  The project, which was developed by Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute in partnership with the SFPA, the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and my Department, will allow the Marine Institute and Inland Fisheries Ireland to collect valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters in a tightly controlled environment.</p></reply>

My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid, and to allow marts to continue to operate.  </p>  <p>  I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p>  <p>  On 19th October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21st  .  The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of this Government is to protect lives and to protect public health, while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.</p>  <p>  Protecting the agrifood sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20th   October, that all marts may continue, but to conduct sales using online platforms only. My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. There are no plans at present to allow in-person attendance of buyers at sales at livestock marts, while Level 5 is in force. Buyers may make arrangements to view the stock available for sale by appointment with mart management.</p>  <p>  Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April. From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently, the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are operating through online platforms.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.</p>  <p>  This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation and will plan for a return to physical marts in line with public health guidelines when it is safe to do so. We are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.</p>  <p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions. On Saturday 24th   October, the online sales companies reported to my officials that, at one stage, more than 40,000 people were logged into online mart sales. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales (the Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday), cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034 head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts involved.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to mention the wide range of supports for businesses which the Government has put in place to help them through Covid.  Agrifood businesses, including marts, are eligible for these supports, which are set out on the Gov.ie website.</p></reply>

Therefore, in Ireland, antibiotics can only be obtained by a farmer on prescription from a veterinary practitioner.  European Regulation 2019/6 comes into effect from January 2022 and will repeal existing national veterinary medicines legislation. In the context of significant One Health concerns arising from antimicrobial resistance, the Regulation has a particular focus on driving more prudent and sustainable use of antimicrobials through enhanced controls.</p><p>In relation to the cost of a course of antibiotics on a typical pig farm, this is a commercial matter and this information is not collated by DAFM. However, it is clear that antibiotics can represent a significant cost for pig production. An outbreak of disease on a pig farm is also well recognised as resulting in reduced growth rates. To counteract this, many farmers are working to implement preventative herd health measures such as strategic use of vaccination, improved biosecurity and housing to reduce their level of antibiotic use.</p><p>Some of the main reasons why antibiotics are used on pig farms are to treat clinically sick animals which may be suffering from bacterial infections such as respiratory disease which can be highly contagious. In these circumstances, in-contact at-risk animals in the same air space may be treated with antibiotics also on foot of veterinary advice to prevent the spread of disease and thereby protect animal health and welfare.</p><p>My Department is not in possession of data that would allow a comparison to be made between different enterprise types, however, free range and organic pig farms only account for a very small proportion of pigs in Ireland.</p><p>The health and welfare of each individual pig herd is the responsibility of that pig farmer working with their veterinary practitioners and advisors to ensure the health and welfare of animals under their care. My Department is also working with Animal Health Ireland on a programme, PigHealthcheck, to progress a number of initiatives to improve the overall health and welfare of the Irish pig herds. These initiatives are currently focused on the control of salmonella, improving biosecurity and rearing pigs with intact tails.  <b></b></p><p>The overall aim of PigHealthcheck is to improve the profitability and sustainability of the Irish pig industry through improved animal health. A code of good practice regarding the responsible use of antimicrobials on pig farms has been developed collaboratively by veterinary and farming stakeholders on the iNAP Animal Health Implementation Committee and a copy of these guidelines has been distributed to every commercial Irish pig herd in recent weeks.</p><p>The national AMU database for pigs (AMUPig)  has only been in place since November 2019 and the data received so far represents 43% coverage of the pig population based on 2019 slaughter figures. Currently, submission of data to AMUPig is voluntary but will be mandated by legislation following the introduction of the new veterinary medicine regulations.  It will be a requirement of the revised Bord Bia quality assurance standard for pigs due to come on stream in the coming months that all commercial pig herds submit data on antibiotics used to my Department.</p></reply>

The multi-functional benefits of forestry are well known including increased removal of carbon from our atmosphere, creation of more habitats rich in biodiversity and better water quality. This support is provided through generous grants and premiums under the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 which has made available over &euro;100m each year for the past 6 years for forestry development including afforestation. I was very pleased also to secure an allocation of &euro;103m in the budget for 2021 to continue these supports. This programme is due to end this year and arrangements are being put in place by my Department to ensure the continuation of these supports beyond 2020. </p>  <p>  Planting in 2020 will fall short of the target of 8,000 hectares set out under the Climate Action Plan. Achieving this level of planting in the years ahead will be challenging and will require shared action from farmers, private sector, public bodies and the community at large. I will shortly be commencing discussions for the next National Forestry Programme and one of my key aims will be to re-engage farmers in the programme. Planting of trees can help drive improved economic and environmental sustainability on Irish farms and I very much intend that farmers have more ownership of the next programme. The model for Ireland has to be more farm forestry. </p>  <p>  It is likely that we will need alternative sources of planting outside of private land if we are to deliver 8,000 hectares, which is why Coillte's proposed collaboration with Bord na Mona to plant their land over the next three years is very welcome. I am hopeful that other public bodies will follow suit and will be looking for support from my colleagues in Government, local authorities and others to help us achieve our national target. Just recently, my Department launched a new afforestation scheme aimed specifically at public bodies called the "Creation of Woodlands on Public Lands' scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to encourage Public Bodies to establish new native woodlands on suitable bare land. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are the first public body to secure approval for the establishment of a native forest under this scheme</p>  <p>  Businesses too can play their part.  A new Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) provides an opportunity for businesses to contribute to the establishment of new native woodlands.  I am pleased to say that there is significant appetite amongst the business community to take part in this initiative thereby helping to meet the Climate Action Plan target. So far An Post, Accenture, KBI Global Investments, Microsoft, Aldi, Lidl and Applegreen have all committed to the WEF, resulting in the planting of almost 250,000 native trees across the country. Many other businesses have been in contact with my Department with a view to taking part, so we expect a pipeline of investment from the business community to develop in the new year. The amount of native woodlands planted as a percentage of total planting has reached record levels as a result of this scheme with 446 hectares planted so far this year. At the beginning of the forestry programme, native woodlands made up just 2% of total planting and the proportion now is 22%. </p>  <p>  Forests are excellent at sequestering carbon dioxide however depending on the species some trees will remove carbon at different rates. Broadleaves and conifers sequester roughly the same carbon dioxide; the maximum value is approximately 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare but this is achieved in 75 years for spruce, compared to 180 years for oak.  However, carbon sequestration does vary from year to year depending on  management and soil type. The afforestation scheme provides support for 12 different planting types in order that anybody considering panting has maximum flexibility and choice for different species.</p></reply>

My Department remains extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, and engaging with the industry to ensure a continued strong performance. </p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over a billion worth of produce. This represented 9.9% growth by value and 12.4% growth by volume compared to 2018. Certification of dairy exports continued to grow in 2019 with the issue of 29,253 certifications.  Despite the challenge posed by Covid-19 throughout 2020, and its pressure on foodservice, export market indicators remain positive with figures showing an increase in the exports of dairy products for the first 8 months of 1.4% by value or &euro;61 million.  </p>  <p>  Irish dairy products have a highly-rated and hard-earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world. My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy, including through a series of 'virtual' trade missions planned for this month.  </p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong, with growing global demand projected from emerging economies with increasing middle classes and demand for protein. There is continued confidence that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand. My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with stakeholders on these and other important issues.</p></reply>

Our approach to market development is a combination of targeted research, high-level diplomacy, consultation with important agri-food stakeholders and co-operation with officials in competent authorities abroad. This approach serves to make the most effective use of available resources and to maximise opportunities for market access. </p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote in 2016, this focus on market development has produced a number of notable achievements. Agreement has been secured for the export of beef to several new third country markets, including: China, Ukraine, Qatar, Kuwait and Barbados. Furthermore, during this period, enhanced beef access was agreed with the US, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. </p>  <p>  The diversification of available markets for Irish beef exports is reflected in the latest available CSO trade figures; between 2016 and 2019, the value of Irish beef going to third country markets increased by nearly 65%, while their share of overall beef exports increased from 6% to over 10%. While the UK remains the biggest destination market for Irish beef, for sound market reasons, the growth seen in exports to third countries demonstrates the positive impact of my Department&rsquo;s market development endeavours.</p>  <p>  Gaining access for industry is usually the culmination of a lengthy process requiring sustained engagement with importing countries to build trust and confidence in our food production systems. My Department will continue to prioritise the development of overseas markets for Irish beef, which were worth &euro;2.3 billion to the Irish economy in 2019. </p></reply>

Of the four major meat species exported from Ireland, the sheepmeat trade is the least reliant on the UK market. In 2019, according to CSO data, 71% of sheepmeat products in value terms were exported to the EU, 20% to the UK and 9% was exported to third country markets. In volume terms, France was the main destination for sheepmeat products. </p>  <p>  As with other meat commodities, my officials continue to work towards opening new outlets for sheepmeat and enhancing existing access to as many markets as possible. This development and diversification strategy remains central to our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit. It is also consistent with the overarching Food Wise sectoral strategy and the seven-point action plan on market access that has been operational since April 2017.  In July 2019, for example, sheepmeat access to the Japanese market was finalised. Once a market has been opened for high-quality Irish lamb, it is up to industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to exploit the opportunities created as trading conditions permit.</p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of global meat markets are strong, with growing global demand projected from emerging economies with increasing middle classes and demand for protein. The Irish food industry is well positioned to gain from the opportunities presented by expanding global demand, underpinned by the success of the overseas market development efforts of my Department, Bord Bia, the Irish embassy network, and those of the Irish food industry. My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with stakeholders on these and other important issues.</p></reply>

The strategy recognises that market entry and penetration is essential to ensure a fair return for primary producers of all meat species. The market development part of the strategy is being implemented by a seven-point action plan launched in April 2017. This plan has been activated through a series of actions undertaken in conjunction with Bord Bia and our overseas embassy network. Progress on action plan goals and objectives is reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department's internal High-Level Market Access Committee. </p>  <p>  Pigmeat is the fourth most valuable export of Irish agri-food sector after dairy, beef and beverages. During 2019, Ireland exported pigmeat to over 50 different countries with international markets accounting for approximately one-third of Irish pigmeat exports in value terms. Currently, Irish pigmeat can be exported to a range of international markets including China, Japan, South Korea, the USA and Canada, and most recently, Mexico, which opened to Irish pigmeat exports in May 2020. </p>  <p>  The short-term outlook for pigmeat markets will be influenced by global supply and demand dynamics as well as by potential further market disturbance caused by the pandemic and the effect of ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to support the Irish pigmeat sector and facilitate its development by prioritising market access both through maintaining existing markets and pursuing access to new ones.</p></reply>

The challenges posed by Brexit have required an increased emphasis on third country market access in order to protect the Agri food sector, given our exposure to the UK market.</p><p>Irish agri-food exports continue to grow, with total exports in 2019 of &euro;14.5 billion, an increase of 6% on 2018. It has, and always will be the case, that the integrity of these exports is of paramount importance to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation globally, and this will remain so post-Brexit.  </p><p>Trade missions will continue to play a key role in the market advancement of Irish agri-food produce.  Of course, with the on-going pandemic, our traditional &quot;in person&quot; method of connecting and developing trade links with new and existing customers is not feasible.  To that end, my Department, in collaboration with Bord Bia, is holding a series of Ministerial Virtual Trade Missions to a number of Asian countries shortly. </p><p>Minister Heydon and I, again in conjunction with Bord Bia, are also currently involved in a series of virtual meetings across priority markets with key international customers. </p><p>Regardless of the outcome of the trade negotiations between the EU and the UK, from 1 January 2021, things will change for our agri-food industry.  Irish exporters to the UK will have to comply with UK import requirements from 1 January 2021.  Whilst my Department has put in place resources to meet the challenges posed by Brexit, including challenges associated with the provision of export certification to the UK post-transition, we await further clarity from the UK Government on the specific export health certificates that will be required.</p></reply>

Under BDGP II, which commenced in 2017, the female replacement requirement is 20% of their reference animals.  This was clearly set out in the terms and conditions of the BDGP at the outset of the six year programme and was also included in the mandatory training module that each participant was required to attend at the start of the Programme.  </p>  <p>  Since 2017, ICBF have posted  regular &ldquo;BDGP Eligibility&rdquo; reports to participants after each genomic evaluation run to give herd owners an up to date picture of where their herds stood in relation to programme targets. Since 2019, the evaluation reports have issued every two months. Therefore, participants could track their progress  in meeting their targets over the six years of the programme.</p>  <p>  Further supports have been put in place more recently in order to assist participants in meeting this requirement.  These included targeted letters and direct phone calls to individual participants by ICBF to offer advice on the best course of action.  A &lsquo;Mart Tracker&rsquo; app was made available by ICBF which allows farmers see the numbers of genotyped 4/5 star females being traded through marts every day.  ICBF, in conjunction with the Department and ICOS, has assisted marts to arrange special sales of genotyped 4/5 star females.  Herds with surplus females and herds that needed to purchase these animals were notified of these sales.  Ongoing consultation with agricultural consultants by DAFM staff has also been in place.</p>  <p>  It has also been agreed that heifers qualifying as 4/5 star in the upcoming November evaluations can be considered for eligibility.</p>  <p>  The requirement in question are is a core element of compliance with the terms and conditions of the programme and delivery is essential in order to underpin payment.  It is therefore not intended to alter the requirements in relation to this element of the scheme</p></reply>

My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid, and to allow marts to continue to operator.  </p>  <p>  I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p>  <p>On 19 October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21 October.  This decision was made on foot of strong evidence presented to the Government of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of this Government is to protect lives and to protect public health, while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.</p>  <p>Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20 October, that all marts may continue but to conduct sales using online platforms only. My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. There are no plans at present to allow in-person sales at livestock marts while Level 5 restrictions are in place.</p>  <p>  Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.</p>  <p>  This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation, and we are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.</p>  <p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  On Saturday 24 October,  the online sales companies reported to my officials that at one stage that day more than 40,000 people were logged in to online mart sales.   The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p></reply>

Global demand for food continues to increase and given our cost efficient grass based production system, Ireland is well placed to supply this increased consumer demand. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are issues that need to be addressed, not least the climate challenge. Emissions from the meat and dairy sectors are biological in nature and the special characteristics of biogenic methane was reference in the Programme for Government. Despite this, absolute emissions from the sector must fall over the years ahead. The sector can achieve these emissions reductions by early adoption of the measures as set in the Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC).

A weekly breakdown of licences issued in September and October is below.</p><p>There are currently sixteen full-time equivalent ecologists working on licensing files, compared to one at the same time last year, with sanction in place for an additional four permanent ecologists.  My Department is currently recruiting 13 Forestry Inspectors, ten of which will be working on licensing files. Seven of the ten are in the final stages of joining the Department and will be deployed over the coming weeks.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act commenced on Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup>October.  Secondary legislation required to give effect to the main provisions of the Act also came into force from today Wednesday 7th October.  The new Act, amending the Agriculture Appeals Act was designed to align forestry licensing appeals process with best practice in other appeals processes.  Among other things, it allows for the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) to determine appeals by enabling it to sit in divisions of itself</p><p>I have moved quickly to resource the FAC to realise the provisions as set out in the Act and have appointed 3 Deputy Chairs along with 2 ordinary members. There are now hearings scheduled for four different FAC Committees. The individuals appointed have been selected on the recommendation of the current Chair of the FAC and have been selected with regard to their particular expertise on issues such as environmental regulation, silvicultural issues and appeals processes. Agriculture Appeals officers will be deployed to sit on these committees also.  Two additional persons with planning expertise have also been contracted to assist members of the FAC. </p><p>I should emphasise that the FAC are operationally independent of my Department and they report their own outputs on their website.</p><p>Number of felling licences issued in September, 2020 <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="3"><div>1-04/09/2020</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 11th September</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 18th September</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 25th September</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>29-30th September</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25</td>       <td>282.32</td>       <td>25766.2</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>431.13</td>       <td>91653.5</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>187.16</td>       <td>43746.2</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>261.58</td>       <td>48078</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>20.53</td>       <td>6775</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Number of felling licences issued in October, 2020 <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="3"><div>1-2/10/2020</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 09/10/2020</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 16/10/2020</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 23/10/2020</div></th>       <th colspan="3"><div>W/E 30/10/2020</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>No.</td>       <td>ha</td>       <td>Volume</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>14.36</td>       <td>4738.8</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>122.84</td>       <td>17893.8</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>427.26</td>       <td>187842.8</td>       <td>69</td>       <td>710.26</td>       <td>210855.4</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>1112</td>       <td>339882<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both quota share and access to UK waters. From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall trade deal is linked to progress on fisheries. This is reflected in the EU negotiation mandate and the draft EU legal text. This Government fully supports the EU negotiating mandate to maintain quota shares and current access going forward.</p>  <p>  Since taking office, I have held meetings with both Michel Barnier and the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius by video link. I have made it clear to both Mr Barnier and the Commissioner that we are placing our full reliance on them to deliver on the agreed EU negotiation mandate that sets down clearly the EU objective to &ldquo;uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and traditional activity of the Union fleet." </p>  <p>  I have also met with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on 12th October, where I listened carefully to the clearly articulated challenges facing the fishing industry in the context of Brexit. I made clear that I will be pressing for a fisheries agreement with the UK that upholds both existing quota shares and existing reciprocal access to UK waters. I will continue to press for the maintenance of the linkage of fisheries to the overall economic partnership agreement as this will be central to a successful agreement.  I assured the industry representatives of my commitment and that of the Government to work towards a fisheries agreement with the UK that protects their interests and ensures a long-term future for our coastal communities dependant on fisheries</p>  <p>  In the event that a Fisheries Agreement between the UK and the EU is not put in place by the end of 2020 (the EU has specified that such an agreement must be agreed in the overall context of future partnership), the key issues for the Irish fishing sector are the potential loss of access for Irish and other EU vessels to the UK fishing zone, the need to ensure ongoing protection of fish stocks in the waters around Ireland from a subsequent increase in fishing activity and potential supports for the seafood sector to meet the challenges they may face.  It is important to be aware that, if a fisheries agreement is not agreed, the EU and Ireland could also face a loss of quota share. In this situation, it will be necessary for a co-ordinated European response to ensure a proportionate and equitable use of mitigation measures for the EU fishing fleet, overseen by the EU Commission.  </p>  <p>  Following the threat of a UK departure without a Withdrawal agreement, the EU Member States prepared an EU Brexit Contingency plan that was published on the 10th April 2019.  This highlighted fisheries as one of the most immediately critical issues facing the EU in a no-deal Brexit.   In the event of a Fisheries Agreement is not agreed, we could immediately face the situation of the UK deciding to deny EU fishing vessels from EU waters in 2021.   </p>  <p>  I am preparing for all scenarios, while strongly supporting the negotiation of a Fisheries agreement in line with the negotiating mandate. I will be seeking additional EU funds to support mitigation measures if they become necessary.  In that regard, the &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund agreed as part of the EU budget for the next seven years recognises that if a future relationship agreement is not in place, it will be essential to provide financial support to counter unforeseen and adverse consequences in Member States and sectors that are worst affected and this would clearly apply to the fisheries sector.</p></reply>

While TB disease is low relative to historical levels, TB herd incidence and reactor numbers have been gradually increasing since 2016. The pace of deterioration has accelerated in 2020. Herd incidence is now at its highest level since 2012 and reactor numbers are now at 2009 rates. Herd incidence is a measure of the number of new restrictions relative to the total number of herds tested in a given period. </p><p>A herd restricted under Irish legislation is, for the purpose of the TB eradication programme, equivalent to Officially Trade Free (OTF) status withdrawn or status suspended in Directive 64/432/EEC. </p><p>To comply with the Directive, the officially tuberculosis-free status of a herd is to remain withdrawn until cleansing and disinfection of the premises and utensils has been completed and all animals over six weeks of age have reacted negatively to at least two consecutive tuberculin tests, the first no less than 60 days and the second no less than four months and no more than 12 months after the removal of the last positive reactor. </p><p>Please see for more information.  </p></reply>

I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of this pandemic, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  </p><p>My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid19 and to allow marts to continue to operate. </p><p>From April to June 8<sup>th</sup>, marts operated without public attendance at sales rings, with marts able to operate transactions online or facilitate the brokering of sales, including the weighing and viewing of stock and the safe processing of financial transactions for buyers and sellers. From June, as other public health restrictions lifted, public attendance at sales rings was again permitted in marts subject to strict compliance with Covid19-specific standard operating procedures in each mart, based on the HSE Covid19 rules.  </p><p>On 19<sup>th</sup>October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21<sup>st</sup>.  Protecting the agri-food sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20<sup>th</sup>October, that sales rings must close, however that all mart business may continue by conducting sales by brokering transactions or by using online platforms.  </p><p>From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise. </p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  On Saturday 24<sup>th</sup>October,  the online sales companies reported to my officials that at one stage that day more than 40,000 people were logged in to online mart sales.The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p><p>Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales, the cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034 head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted immediate disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved. Buyers may still view animals in person by prior appointment with the relevant mart.</p><p>These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts to keep operating in this difficult period.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines.  I have no plans to reintroduce physical presence at sales at marts premises while Level 5 remains in force.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;<i>Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>&rsquo;, issued by Government, states that all museums, galleries and other cultural attractions, including all public, school and academic libraries, are closed to the public under Level 5 but are available for online services. The public health risk is deemed such that people are being asked to stay at home, apart from essential work or attending school. It is vital that we limit our contacts and trips outside of our homes and this currently includes visits to the library.  That said, some libraries are offering a delivery service of library items including books, audiobooks and DVDs to vulnerable households, in line with arrangements put in place earlier this year to support those who were cocooning. </p><p>An excellent online library service is available nationwide and my Department has invested some &euro;400,000 in the online service this year alone. It provides access to more than 48,000 eBooks and 33,000 audiobooks, 4,000 magazines, 2,400 online newspapers from over 100 countries, more than 500 e-learning courses and 100 online language courses.</p><p>The provision of the public library service is generally a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a library authority under the Local Government Act 2001. Under the Act, each local authority Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of their local authority and this also applies during the current pandemic.  Accordingly, it is a matter for each Chief Executive to determine what is essential work for their staff. </p></reply>

Findings highlighted weaknesses in the current control environment.  The financial management and governance of the company were identified as requiring immediate action.  There had also been some contact  in relation to the matter by individuals within WAP to both my Department and Waterford City and County Council, however no protected disclosures were made.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, Pobal and Waterford City and County Council have met regularly since January to discuss the audit findings and to agree solutions.  The overall priority has been to ensure the continued delivery of programmes such as the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and that supports and services to disadvantaged individuals and communities continue to be delivered, particularly in the context of COVID-19, while also ensuring that the findings of the audit process are addressed as quickly as possible.   As part of this process, WAP were required to submit a detailed proposal setting out the actions and timelines for addressing the audit findings and the associated costs. </p>  <p>  The plan submitted indicated an acceptance by WAP of the audit findings and a willingness and openness to address the issues arising.   The local authority, Pobal and DRCD acknowledged  the continuing work being undertaken by WAP and in particular their ongoing work through SICAP and their contribution to the local efforts to address the unprecedented level of need arising from the COVID-19 crisis. </p>  <p>  It was also agreed to work with and support the WAP Board of Directors in building on their efforts to date to address governance weaknesses.  As part of the collaborative approach to date, an external company has been engaged to work with WAP to put in place a more sustainable governance structure to ensure the continued delivery of social inclusion programmes in Waterford.  The cost of this external support is &euro;25,168.</p>  <p>  On the separate matter of monies being reclaimed by Waterford LCDC (who manage the SICAP contract locally), on foot of a Pobal audit, it was established that WAP spent some of their 2015 SICAP allocation outside programme rules.  This resulted in a financial correction being imposed on WAP.  SICAP programme rules must be strictly applied and complied with, particularly given that the programme is part funded by the EU through the European Social Fund.  </p></reply>

The current 2014-2020 LEADER programming period concludes in December 2020.  </p><p>Proposals for new regulations for the CAP 2021-2027 were launched in June 2018 by the European Commission.  However, given the protracted nature of discussions on the post-2020 CAP and the wider EU Budget at EU level, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals<b>.  </b>This means that the next LEADER programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  The objective of this commitment is to allow local-led rural development projects to be delivered under a Transitional Programme until the new EU programme commences.</p><p>The European Commission has published proposals for transitional measures to allow for continuity between the programming periods.  The Commission's proposals are still under discussion at EU level and there are a number of issues yet to be resolved, including the duration of the transitional period.  </p><p>Nonetheless, I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the details of a Transitional LEADER Programme for Ireland, to come into effect in 2021. </p><p>An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.  I can confirm that the allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, as well as for new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme and to support the administration costs of Local Action Groups in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.</p><p>It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years, depending on the nature and scale of the projects concerned.  In this context, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are also likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023.</p></reply>

The new policy will be forward-looking, ambitious, and will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019.  It will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural economies and communities and will identify policy measures for delivery in order to achieve these objectives.  As was the case with the Action Plan, the new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The new policy will recognise that strong rural economies and communities are vital in supporting our national recovery and enhancing our nationwide wellbeing. It will also emphasise the interdependence between urban and rural areas in this regard.</p>  <p>  The process of developing the policy has included a wide range of consultation events with key stakeholders, including Government Departments, State agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people, and the wider public. The insights and views captured through this extensive consultation process have helped to identify the issues that matter to people living and working in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the past months, my Department has held a series of further discussions with key stakeholders to explore the short and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on rural communities and economies and identify actions required to assist rural areas to recover from the impact of COVID-19.  I hosted a public webinar on the topic on 24th September. </p>  <p>  The inputs from these consultations are being factored in to the drafting of the policy and I anticipate that the final policy will be submitted to Government for approval in the near future, prior to its publication.</p></reply>

In total, I have allocated &euro;10.4 million to 363 projects across the three funding rounds.  </p>  <p>  The items funded in each town or village under the Accelerated Measure were based on needs identified locally. The purchase of Christmas lights featured in a small number of project applications, to enable towns to enhance the appearance of their streets and shops, host Christmas festivals and attract additional footfall.</p>  <p>  Applications under the standard strand of the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, which has a budget of  &euro;15 million, are currently being assessed and the successful projects will be announced when that process is complete.  However, this strand focuses on larger scale projects, and particularly those that will assist our towns and villages to recover from the impact of COVID-19 in the medium-term.  </p></reply>
