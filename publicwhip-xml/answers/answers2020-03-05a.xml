Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32m plus VAT for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna FR 172H fleet. The contract is well underway and it is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper  also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. Following a tender competition a contract was awarded to Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019 for delivery to two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2019 NDP allocation. The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to continue the programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included for funding.</p></reply>

The WHO Handbook notes that there are specific contraindications and possible side-effects for all anti-malarial drugs.</p>  <p>  The report of the Malaria Chemoprophylaxis Working Group was prepared in the context of current and potential litigation, and is therefore legally privileged and will not be published. </p></reply>

As these reports were prepared in the context of current and potential litigation, they are legally privileged and will not be published. </p>  <p>  The second Working Group report, finalised in October 2017, made a number of recommendations  intended to ensure that the Defence Forces medical policies and practices continue to develop in light of best practice. These recommendations focused on a number of different areas, including planning, training, education and information sharing. There is also a recommendation to establish a Medical Advisory Group to provide ongoing expert medical advice, including that of external experts, to the Defence Forces in relation to a range of medical matters including malaria chemoprophylaxis. An Implementation Group subsequently established to progress these recommendations has met on six occasions to date and is progressing its work through a structured plan. </p>  <p>  Given that there is litigation pending in relation to these matters which is being managed by the State Claims Agency, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. </p></reply>

My statement following the release of the plan on 28 January was as follows: </p>  <p>  "The US initiative on the Middle East Peace Process has just been announced. I have engaged very actively with the US Middle East team over the past three years. I have made clear that Ireland would be willing to support any peace initiative that respected the international parameters for a two-state solution and UN Security Council resolutions, and provided a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples. We need to see the details and assess the full implications of the US initiative, but from what I have heard so far, the proposed plan does not meet this threshold. A successful resolution of the conflict can only be reached if both parties are included on an equal basis and can work together for an agreed outcome. No solution can be imposed and no unilateral moves should take place.I am deeply concerned by the comments made by PM Netanyahu today regarding extending Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and over settlements across the West Bank.  </p>  <p>  Let me be clear - annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including by the UN Charter. Such an action would be a decisive step away from the Oslo Accords, which both parties signed, and which Ireland has worked tirelessly to support for over 25 years. It would also be a decisive step away from the commitment to an agreed solution between the parties; a solution which could be backed and supported by the international community as a whole.  </p>  <p>  We will study the plan in more detail but our initial response is one of grave concern that it fails to achieve the balance and equality of esteem necessary to gain the support of both sides to the conflict and the international community.  </p>  <p>  I intend to remain in close contact with the parties, the countries of the region, with our EU partners and with the US." </p>  <p>  In the weeks since the announcement of the US plan, my EU colleagues and I have continued to stress that any solution will require the agreement of both parties, and that no unilateral actions should take place. I welcomed the statement by the EU High Representative on 4 February, which recalled the EU&rsquo;s commitment a negotiated two-State solution, based on 1967 lines; called on both sides to re-engage and to refrain from any unilateral actions contrary to international law that could exacerbate tensions; and made clear that steps towards annexation, if implemented, could not pass unchallenged. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy, which I will continue to prioritise. </p></reply>

We have consistently raised the issue with the British Government on a bilateral basis, including at the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, most recently on 8 May 2019.</p>  <p>  I and Minister Flanagan have made clear to our counterparts that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government, and that there remains an urgent need for a response. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House and until a resolution is found.</p>  <p>  The Government maintains a close and cooperative relationship with Justice for the Forgotten, as we continue work to seek the full facts of the appalling events of 17 May 1974 and of other attacks in this jurisdiction during the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The Government has noted the announcement by the PSNI on 30 November that former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher will head an Independent Police Team to conduct an analytical report on the Glenanne Gang series of cases.  This is welcome.</p>  <p>  The Government is conscious that this work by Chief Constable Boutcher is very relevant to a number of cases of the utmost concern for victims&rsquo; families and survivors, both North and South, who suffered in the murderous attacks by the so-called Glenanne Gang. This includes the Hillcrest Bar bombing, and the Miami Showband attack, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and also, of course, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  It is to be hoped that the report being conducted by Chief Constable Boutcher will contribute to the long process of justice, truth and acknowledgement of what happened in these awful cases, where collusion is a feature.</p>  <p>  Chief Constable Boutcher will be conducting a police investigation, and as such will be in a position to seek the cooperation of the Garda&iacute; through the framework of Mutual Legal Assistance, which underpins the excellent cooperation that exists between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI more broadly.</p>  <p>  The Government will be supportive of facilitating this investigation, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland, in relation to the attacks conducted by Glenanne Gang and of course other cases from the Troubles.</p>  <p>  In any scenario, we will continue to engage with the British Government, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House, until a satisfactory resolution is found.</p></reply>

I also met with EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels in advance of the General Affairs Council.</p><p>The EU mandate sets out the EU&rsquo;s clear position, based on the Political Declaration agreed between the EU and the UK on 17 October 2019, as well as the European Council guidelines and conclusions. This provides a generous and fair foundation on which a new EU-UK relationship can be built. </p><p>There has been extensive interdepartmental co-ordination across Government to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are reflected in the EU mandate.  We have also worked closely with our EU partners to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our priorities and interests. The mandate reflects the breadth and ambition on the part of the EU for a close and deep partnership with the UK. Of course, the level of ambition for the future partnership on the UK side will also influence what is possible to achieve. </p><p>We welcome the continuing focus in the EU mandate on protecting the Good Friday Agreement and on ensuring that issues arising from Ireland's unique geographic situation are addressed, as well as the Common Travel Area.  Protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the Peace Process in all circumstances continue to be key priorities for Ireland and these priorities are shared by our EU partners.</p><p>The UK Government published its approach to the negotiations on 27 February, in advance of the start of negotiations between the EU and the UK on Monday, 2 March. Negotiation rounds will alternate between London and Brussels, and, on the EU side, will be conducted on behalf of the 27 Member States, by the Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom, under Michel Barnier, and the Commission.</p><p>It is welcome that the negotiations have opened in respect of a broad range of issues, as reflected in the mandate, with negotiations planned and underway on: </p><p>(i)Trade in Goods</p><p>(ii)Trade in Services and Investment and other issues</p><p>(iii)Transport (Aviation &amp;amp; Other)</p><p>(iv)Horizontal Arrangements and Governance</p><p>(v)Energy (Civil Nuclear Co-operation &amp;amp; Other)</p><p>(vi)Participation in Union Programmes</p><p>(vii)Level Playing Field for open and fair Competition</p><p>(viii)  Law Enforcement and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</p><p>(ix)Mobility and Social Security Co-ordination</p><p>(x)Thematic Co-operation</p><p>(xi)Fisheries</p><p>Given the UK position that the transition period will not be extended beyond the end of 2020, as Michel Barnier has indicated, it may not be possible to reach agreement on all issues currently being discussed as part of the negotiations in the available time.  We will continue to work closely and assess progress with our EU partners as the talks progress. </p><p>The Political Declaration sets out a commitment to establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, upholding access to waters and quota shares, within the context of the overall economic partnership. This issue was one which I discussed with Michel Barnier in Brussels last week and I welcome that he has been clear, that fisheries is part of the negotiations package, linked to FTA in goods and level playing field issues.</p><p>The work of the period ahead will be to achieve an ambitious and fair partnership that works for the benefit of all, and provides a new and strong foundation for the EU-UK relationship. </p><p>At the same time, it is important to see the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The link between implementation and Future Relationship negotiations is also reflected in the mandate.</p><p>The ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement means that, regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland will be in place.</p><p>The Protocol includes measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, maintain the Common Travel Area, the Single Electricity Market and protect continuing North South cooperation. It maintains commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens and reaffirms the EU and UK commitment to the PEACE PLUS programme.  </p><p>Implementing what has already been agreed between the EU and UK is important in establishing the trust needed for a successful outcome to the Future Relationship negotiations.</p><p>During the transition period, running to 31 December 2020, the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland will be overseen by the UK and the EU through the Joint Committee and Specialised Committees established under the Withdrawal Agreement. </p><p>The first meeting of the Joint Committee is expected to take place in March, with further meetings in 2020. European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic will represent the EU at the Joint Committee and Michael Gove MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, will represent the UK. </p><p>While the Joint Committee and the Specialised Committees are EU-UK fora, Ireland is preparing to engage appropriately in taking this work forward.  In accordance with Council Decision 2020/135 of 30 January 2020, a representative of Ireland may accompany the Commission representative in meetings of the Committee on issues related to the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland where those issues are specific to Ireland/Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

This will mean significant change for Government, citizens and businesses when the transition period ends on 31 December 2020.  It is important that we all prepare for this change. </p>  <p>  Following the end of transition period, the UK will no longer apply the rules of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  Even if the EU and UK can achieve an ambitious and deep agreement in such a short timeframe, it will not be the status quo and will involve considerable disruption, change and adjustment. There are significant sectoral and regional variations to the overall economic impact of Brexit with agri-food, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism among the most exposed and vulnerable sectors.</p>  <p>  The Contingency Action Plan Update published by Government in July 2019 provided comprehensive overview of No Deal Brexit preparations and mitigation measures. The planning undertaken and lessons learned from no deal preparations will be valuable as we plan for the post transition EU-UK relationship.  </p>  <p>  Key elements of Brexit preparedness have already been significantly progressed, but will need further work for any future relationship outcome. These include ongoing infrastructure works and resource upgrades at our ports and airports for additional checks and controls on East-West trade; business readiness and supports for the most impacted sectors; risks of supply chain disruption; security of supply of medicines; addressing concerns over potential disruption to the UK landbridge and a communications campaign.  Government Departments continue Brexit preparedness and contingency work across all sectors, and given the uncertainties surrounding the possible outcomes of the forthcoming future relationship negotiations, this work will continue to be a priority for the period ahead. Brexit preparedness will be closely aligned with the ongoing negotiations to ensure we are in a position to address challenges as they arise. </p>  <p>  No set of arrangements will be able to replicate the access and benefits of the UK being a member of the EU and within the Single Market and Customs Union. Ireland will continue to face these changes with the mutual solidarity and support of our EU partners and with all of the strength that EU membership brings.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;6 billion, in two tranches of &euro;3 billion, has been mobilised from the EU budget and Member State resources and had been fully committed to specific programmes by the end of 2019, as foreseen. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is &euro;38.34 million. Payments under the first tranche are due to continue until 2021 and under the second tranche until 2025. </p>  <p>  The issue of a possible further extension of the Facility is currently being considered. Given the scale of humanitarian needs in Turkey, Ireland is supportive of continuing EU efforts to assist in meeting these needs.</p>  <p>  While recent events on the Greek-Turkish border have highlighted some of the real difficulties with the implementation of the terms of the Agreement, both the EU and Turkey have reiterated their commitment to its continued implementation. It is essential that the EU-Turkey Agreement is upheld and that Greece, and other States on the EU's external borders, are not left alone. </p>  <p>  On the wider migration issue, Ireland has consistently called for all EU Member States to play their part in burden sharing and helping to relieve pressure on frontline Member States. It is essential that we find a consensus based on solidarity and responsibility.</p></reply>

We are committed to promoting freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities. This commitment to promoting freedom of religion or belief is reaffirmed in  Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World.   We regularly advocate for effective action to counter the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in all relevant international fora, including within the European Union and United Nations. </p>  <p>  The EU's policy in this area is led by the Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which were adopted during our Presidency in 2013.   At the February Foreign Affairs Council, Council Conclusions were adopted on EU Priorities in UN Human Rights Fora in 2020 which reaffirm the EU's commitment to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief.  The EU confirmed that it will condemn persecution, discrimination and violence against persons belonging to religious minorities and communities and the abuse of blasphemy laws, while defending the right for individuals to manifest their religion or belief, to change or leave a religion or belief. </p>  <p>  At the United Nations, Ireland engaged actively in EU led initiatives on freedom of religion or belief at the 40th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2019 and the 74th session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly  in November 2019 and co-sponsored resolutions in both instances.  </p>  <p>  At the 43rd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, currently underway in Geneva, Ireland delivered a national statement reiterating our commitment to promoting freedom of religion or belief and our support for the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. </p>  <p>  Ireland regularly takes part in other international meetings on freedom of religion or belief and most recently attended the 7th Meeting of the Istanbul Process on combatting religious intolerance and the 11th Meeting of the International Contact Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief, both of which took place in The Hague in November last year. </p></reply>

The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held. </p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. The decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the opinion polls to which the Deputy refers but, on the balance of evidence at present, this Government does not believe it likely that a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change. </p>  <p>  In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has stated that the Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, both on rights issues and on the constitutional future that they wish to see for Northern Ireland &ndash; whether nationalist, unionist or neither. </p>  <p>  These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration and the Government will continue to engage and reflect on them.</p>  <p>  Over the last year, in response to the range of concerns arising from Brexit, this Government has focused on securing ratification and implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement to allow for an ordered Brexit, including a smooth transition period; preparing for the next phase of Brexit negotiations dealing with the future EU-UK relationship; securing the return to effective operation of the power-sharing Executive and Assembly and the North South Ministerial Council; and, ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the Peace Process, as the UK leaves the EU. </p>  <p>  Following the result of the Brexit referendum, an All Island Civic Dialogue was established and has met on a number of occasions. We are committed to maintaining the all-island civic dialogue that has worked in the context of Brexit to date but also potentially as a useful structure to discuss future challenges to relationships on the island of Ireland. It should also be noted that the Government has recently established a Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly to bring forward proposals to advance gender equality, the first meeting of which was held in January. Following this, it is planned that a new Assembly will consider the best method of local government for Dublin.</p></reply>

Bettercoal is an organisation established by major coal buyers to ensure coal is being sourced via responsible supply chains, which the ESB joined in 2014. This assessment indicates that the Cerrej&oacute;n mine's operating principles are essentially in line with the Bettercoal best practice code.

The meeting was an opportunity to discuss the challenging situation for human rights and environmental defenders in Honduras. Officials also expressed condolences on behalf of my Department to Ms Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga C&aacute;ceres on the tragic death of her mother, Berta C&aacute;ceres, who was murdered in 2016. </p>  <p>  I condemn unreservedly violence perpetrated against those seeking to defend their rights, as well as a culture of impunity where it exists. My Department has been following developments regarding the case brought against a number of individuals who have now been convicted of the murder of Ms C&aacute;ceres. I would urge the Honduran Government to continue its efforts to bring those responsible to justice. </p>  <p>  I was disappointed therefore by the decision of the Government to not renew the mandate of the OAS-sponsored Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH). Ireland fully supports the EU statement issued on 22 January, which stated that the Honduran Government must continue to strengthen anti-corruption efforts, including through legislative reform and the reorganisation of the penal justice system. </p>  <p>  Ms Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga C&aacute;ceres was joined in her meeting by representatives from Tr&oacute;caire, which has just launched a report &lsquo;Women Taking the Lead: Defending Human Rights and the Environment&rsquo;. My Department provides funding to Tr&oacute;caire in support of its work in Honduras, and other countries in the region. </p>  <p>  Tr&oacute;caire works in partnership with local NGOs in the country and has developed a range of programmes focused on respect for human rights and protection of human rights defenders, resource rights, eradication of violence against women, and disaster risk reduction. Between 2017 and 2018, Tr&oacute;caire spent over &euro;5.2 million in Honduras, of which over 40% was funded by this Department. </p>  <p>  This forms part of the over &euro;7.8m that Ireland provided in funding to civil society organisations working in the country from 2012 to 2018. One of the central priorities supported by this funding has been to ensure that the rights of vulnerable people, victims and survivors of human rights abuses are respected, protected and restored or repaired in a dignified manner. </p>  <p>  During Honduras&rsquo; most recent UN Universal Periodic Review, Ireland intervened to express its concern at the climate of violence and insecurity in which human rights defenders operate in Honduras, and to recommend that adequate financial and human resources be allocated to ensure the implementation of legislation to protect human rights defenders and journalists. </p>  <p>  Following the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic footprint in Latin America and the Caribbean, Ireland has moved our accreditation to Honduras to our Embassy in Mexico, which will enhance our ability to engage on issues on the ground. </p>  <p>  We also regularly discuss the situation in Honduras with our EU partners and engage with the EU delegation in Tegucigalpa. The European Union followed the investigation and observed the trial of those accused of Ms Caceres' murder since its beginning.</p>  <p>  Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin, and at our Embassy in Mexico, will continue to monitor events in Honduras closely and to engage with our EU, civil society and international partners on these important issues.</p></reply>

For example, I made a statement in November 2019 reaffirming our long held position, as follows:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s position on Israeli settlements remains clear and unchanged. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, notably the Fourth Geneva Convention. This is also the EU position.</p>  <p>  The views of the international community on settlements have been comprehensively expressed on multiple occasions, including in UN Security Council Resolution 2334 of 2016. </p>  <p>  Not only are settlements illegal, but they actively undermine the prospects for a two-state solution. Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two-state solution which is in the best interest of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I have also commented publically on the recent increase in settlement announcements in and near East Jerusalem, to which the Deputy refers. My statement released on 21 February following the announcements in Har Homa and Givat Hamatos was as follows:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;I condemn the latest announcement on further settlement construction and expansion in parts of East Jerusalem. All settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory is very clearly illegal under international law. </p>  <p>  The construction of settlements in the Har Homa and Givat Hamatos areas in East Jerusalem would be a significant step, undermining the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State. I urge the Israeli Government to desist from any further steps in relation to these specific settlement plans, and to halt all settlement construction.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador in Tel Aviv conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s position directly to the Israeli authorities on 27 February, along with a number of other EU colleagues. I also welcomed the statement by EU HRVP Borrell on 28 February condemning the recent announcements, including those in Area E1. The Israel/Palestine conflict is also due to be discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council later this month.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy, which I will continue to prioritise. </p></reply>

The circumstances in which this person was killed are unclear, and therefore I will not comment on the events leading to their death.</p>  <p>  However, the apparent manner in which the Israeli Defence Forces removed the body of the deceased, as shown in a video and in images widely circulated on social and traditional media, is deeply disturbing. International humanitarian law, as set out in the Geneva Conventions, their Additional Protocols and elsewhere, includes provisions designed to prevent maltreatment of dead bodies in times of conflict, and to ensure that the deceased are treated decently. I am also concerned by reports of the use of excessive force against Palestinian civilians, who attempted to recover the body.</p>  <p>  Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law are clear and I call on the Israeli authorities to respect these obligations with due regard for the protection of basic human dignity.

Ireland, together with our EU partners, stand firmly with the Venezuelan people and their legitimate democratic aspirations.</p>  <p>  It is important to recall that the Presidential elections which saw Nicol&aacute;s Maduro re-elected in May 2018 lacked legitimacy. On 6 February 2019, Ireland joined the majority of other EU MS in acknowledging and supporting Mr. Guaid&oacute;, President of the democratically elected National Assembly, as President ad interim of Venezuela, in order for him to call for free, fair and democratic presidential elections.  </p>  <p>  Continued attempts to block the functioning of the National Assembly, the democratic and legitimate body of Venezuela, and the ongoing harassment of its members, have led to a deterioration of the political situation and have impeded efforts to reach a negotiated solution to the crisis in the country. </p>  <p>  The actions that took place on 5 January surrounding the planned re-election of the President of the National Assembly were deeply troubling. Ireland fully supports the EU statement issued on that date that condemned the serious irregularities that occurred. This statement also reaffirmed support for Mr Guaid&oacute; in his role as President of the National Assembly. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the National Assembly is able to carry out the mandate it has received from the Venezuelan people.  Respecting democratic institutions and principles and upholding the rule of law are essential conditions to finding a peaceful and sustainable solution to the crisis in Venezuela for the benefit of its people.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to support the reinstatement of democracy and the rule of law, through free and fair elections. The situation was most recently discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels on 17 February. Ireland supports EU efforts, including through the International Contact Group (ICG) and Special Adviser Enrique Iglesias, to engage with all relevant actors and stakeholders in an effort to secure and support a Venezuelan-owned solution. </p>  <p>  I, along with EU partners, have also regularly voiced support for the Oslo Talks process, facilitated by Norway. While these talks have now been suspended, Ireland encourages both sides to engage in good faith in an inclusive, serious and results-oriented process.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation in the country closely and engage with my EU colleagues on this important issue.</p></reply>

On 10 November 2019, the Organisation of American States (OAS) released a preliminary report indicating that it had found clear irregularities, and that it could not verify the result of the October elections. </p>  <p>  A further report from the OAS published on 4 December 2019 concluded that there was intentional manipulation and serious irregularities, which had made it impossible to validate the results originally issued by the Bolivian electoral authorities. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the report by researchers at the Election Data and Science Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released in the last few days, the findings of which are strongly challenged by the OAS. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU statements issued in November 2019 which called for a new Electoral Court to be appointed that could offer guarantees of transparent elections, and a return to constitutional normality so that the rule of law, democratic principles and civil right rights are respected, as well as calling for an institutional solution that allowed for a caretaking interim leadership to prepare for new elections. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that new legislative and Presidential elections are now scheduled to take place in Bolivia on 3 May 2020. An exploratory EU mission was deployed to Bolivia from 6-22 January 2020 to assess the usefulness of deploying a full EU election observation mission (EOM) to Bolivia for the May elections. </p>  <p>  On 20 February 2020, the EU confirmed that, following an invitation by the Bolivian authorities, it would deploy an EOM to the country to observe the first round of Presidential and legislative elections on 3 May next. The EOM will also observe a possible second round of Presidential elections on 14 June. Ireland is fully supportive of this approach. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with our EU counterparts to support Bolivia in its path towards peaceful, inclusive and credible elections. We will continue to monitor developments through our Embassy in Buenos Aires, which is accredited to Bolivia.</p></reply>

The ISIF debt facility was provided alongside senior debt from Allied Irish Banks and the European Investment Bank and was structured to ensure certainty of funding for the Port Company. It also has tailored flexibility to meet the requirements of this nationally and regionally significant project.</p>  <p>  These investments bring the total deployed under the Connectivity Fund to over &euro;90 million. ISIF have informed me that there are a range of further pipeline connectivity-based investments on which it is currently working.</p>  <p>  ISIF&rsquo;s refocused strategy targets five priority themes, one of which is investment to support regional development. As such, the ISIF have advised that the Connectivity Fund will henceforth be focused on commercial investments that support improved regional connectivity.</p></reply>

This is because the impact will depend on several factors, not least the duration of the epidemic as well as the containment measures put in place to limit its spread. These are simply impossible to estimate and, accordingly, it is extremely difficult to quantify the macroeconomic impact at this point in time. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the OECD has estimated that, in a scenario where economic disruption is mainly confined to China, with only limited spill-overs to other regions, measures put in place to contain the Covid19 virus could take &frac12; a percentage point (pp) off the growth rate of the global economy this year.  </p>  <p>  I would stress, however, that this is a very benign scenario - it is also based on the assumption that the impact is mostly contained to the first quarter of this year, which appears a somewhat heroic assumption.  In a broader contagion scenario, where the economic fall-out is longer-lasting and more widespread, the OECD estimates that this could take 1&frac12; percentage points off the global growth rate. </p>  <p>  As small and export-oriented, the Irish economy is particularly sensitive to external economic conditions. Over the medium-term, the pass-through of a global shock to the domestic economy tends to be broadly one-for-one - i.e. if world demand falls by 1 pp then, over the medium term, Irish economic activity is c. 1 pp below what would otherwise have been the case &ndash; with a less than one-for-one impact in the short-term. Slower growth would, in turn, have negative consequences for the labour market and the public finances.</p>  <p>  While difficult to quantify at this stage, there are likely to be negative impacts for the Irish economy across a range of sectors.  An increasingly integrated world economy means that supply-chains are also increasingly integrated, with many being &lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo;.  Falling production of intermediate goods in China is now affecting the final output in other countries that will also likely impact production facilities in Ireland.  In terms of direct trade links, the share of goods trade with China is around 6 per cent of total trade, based on preliminary data for last year. </p>  <p>  However, indirect exposure to China is potentially more significant. The euro area is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner, accounting for close to a third of total exports.  In turn, China accounts for 9 per cent of total euro area goods and services trade.  </p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the situation closely and will prepare updated economic forecasts over the next month or so, taking into account all of the latest available information.  It must be stressed, however, that in the current environment, there is much more uncertainty than normal attached to any set of forecasts. </p></reply>

Death Benefit Insurance is provided by insurance firms. The Central Bank has informed me that it is aware that some credit unions discharge some or all of the cost of the insurance on behalf of its members, while other credit unions have adopted a member pay approach. Central Bank credit union regulations do not place any specific requirements on credit unions that participate in Death Benefit Insurance schemes.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank have also informed me that their vision for the credit union sector is &ldquo;Strong Credit Unions in Safe Hands&rdquo;. The Central Bank&rsquo;s vision underpins its statutory mandate to ensure the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally. In undertaking its statutory mandate and responsibilities towards credit unions, the Central Bank recognises the important financial and social role credit unions play in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I recognise the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland and the Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall; and the Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. As Minister for Finance I have no role in the provision of Death Benefit Insurance by the credit unions. </p></reply>

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. </p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Last year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.</p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p></reply>

The grace period acts as a practical buffer so as to avoid the reporting of technical arrears by a CIP over which a Credit Information Subject (CIS) may have little control. In relation to less frequent loan payments (e.g. quarterly, annually etc.) there is time for a CIP to check that everything is in order prior to the payment falling due and consequently no "grace period" is applied to these loan types.</p></reply>

It is also important to note that the Probate Office of the High Court deals with matters relating to probate and as such is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may also wish to note that under section 21 of the 1997 Act, a credit union member may nominate a third party (e.g. a family member) to be the recipient upon the death of the member to the whole or part of the member&rsquo;s property that they have in the credit union at the time of their death.</p>  <p>  The 1997 Act imposes a statutory limit of &euro;23,000 on the amount that can be passed by way of a nomination. Thus, if at the date of the nominator's death the amount of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union exceeds &euro;23,000, the credit union may only dispose any property up to the value of &euro;23,000. The effect of these provisions are that any nomination up to &euro;23,000 will pass outside the terms of any will. Any sum in excess of this will revert to and be an asset of the estate, which needs to be distributed under the terms of the will or the rules of succession where there is no will.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank have also advised me that in order to be registered a credit union must have a set of rules. Under section 15 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the registered rules of a credit union bind all members. In some cases these rules specifically set out the credit union's approach to the nomination of property and the statutory limit under the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Section 23 of the Credit Union Act 1997 as amended (1997 Act) provides for the provision of small payments on death. Under section 23 if a member of a credit union dies and, at his death, his property in the credit union does not in the whole exceed &euro;15,000 and is not the subject of a nomination under section 21 the board of directors of the credit union may, without letters of administration or probate of any will, distribute that property among such persons as appears to the board (on such evidence as they consider satisfactory) to be entitled by law to receive it.</p>  <p>  Ordinarily the production of a grant of probate would be required to release funds from a bank account to the personal representative, irrespective of the amount. However, if a person dies leaving small amounts of money in a bank, the bank may agree to release the funds without the necessity for a grant of probate.</p>  <p>  While most applicants instruct a solicitor to process their application for a grant of probate, personal applications can also be made to the Probate Office of the High Court for a grant of probate.</p>  <p>  If an individual is not satisfied in any of their dealings with a financial services provider the individual may make a complaint to the provider&rsquo;s internal complaint resolution process.

However when examined from an average claim perspective, they indicate that the average settlement for litigated cases under &euro;100,000 is just over &euro;23,000 while the accompanying average legal costs is just over &euro;14,500.  When this is compared with the average PIAB award of just over &euro;22,500, and its average legal costs of &euro;753, it raises questions about how the differential in legal costs can be justified.  In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.  I do not believe these differentials are sustainable and in light of this comparative information, set out in the NCID report and the table, I believe that legal profession needs to recognise their role regarding costs.  The data within the NCID report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.  This is a key aim of our work in the CIWG.</p><p>In conclusion, the NCID Report demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.  In this regard, the data in the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.  This is not sustainable in my view.  This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.  I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines later this year.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, cost management is likely to remain a high priority for banks as it is an area under their control. </p>  <p>  However, branch closures are always a matter of regret, and I as Minister, would hope that closures are kept to the minimum necessary for financial sustainability. Notwithstanding this, I do expect that any bank closing branches will do everything it can to mitigate the impacts of the branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank, that within its Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) that there is a requirement that a regulated firm must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. In addition, Provision 3.12 of the Code requires that banks make clear to consumers when they intend to close a branch, in order to allow consumers to make alternative arrangements if they so wish.  When intending to close, merge or move a branch, the bank must:</p>  <p>  1. notify the Central Bank immediately;</p>  <p>  2. provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;</p>  <p>  3. ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to its closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and</p>  <p>  4. notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance.</p>  <p>  In line with the requirements of Provision 3.12, when the Central Bank is made aware of any branch closures, it engages with the regulated entity to ensure the impact of any decision regarding branch closures is carefully considered across its full customer base. The Central Bank expects that the regulated entity in question will provide affected vulnerable customers with all the assistance that is necessary to ensure that they retain full access to basic financial services, albeit at another branch location.</p>  <p>  For those who are concerned that there is a lack of convenient commercial bank services in light of branch closures, I would like to draw your attention to the Indecon report on Community Banking in Ireland published by my Department in December 2019. The report concluded that there is extensive provision of banking services by credit unions, An Post, as well as by commercial banking providers in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  The report found that there are 1,912 branches operated by banks, credit unions and post offices in Ireland, 63% of these branches are post offices or credit unions and 37% are banks. The Indecon report also demonstrates that there is a higher number of branches per capita in many of the counties where a significant percentage of the population resides in rural areas.</p></reply>

The Central Bank adopts a &lsquo;technology neutral&rsquo; approach meaning that the same principles of regulation, including the rules of the Code, apply equally to both digital and traditional delivery environments.</p>  <p>  Part 4 of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016, Access to Payment Accounts, Article 15, sets out that payment accounts with basic features shall be made available to consumers by all relevant credit institutions, without discrimination.</p>  <p>  Part 4, Article 17 of those 2016 Regulations outlines the minimum level of services that must be offered to the consumer. This includes services enabling the opening, operating and closing of the payment account, placement of funds in the account and the withdrawal of cash from the account. These services must be available to carry out at the counter on the premises of the credit institution and at ATM machines. The account must also permit the execution, within the EU, of direct debits, payment transactions using a payment card and credit transfers at terminals and counters of the relevant credit institution.</p>  <p>  In December 2019,  the Department of Finance published the Indecon report on Community Banking in Ireland, the conclusions of this Report indicate that customers have alternative banking options available to them aside from commercial banks.  The report concluded that there is extensive provision of banking services in the Irish market, not just by commercial banks but by credit unions and An Post. </p>  <p>  The report found that there are 1912 branches operated by banks, credit unions and post offices in Ireland, 63% of these branches are post offices or credit unions and 37% are banks. The Indecon report also demonstrates that there is a higher number of branches per capita in many of the counties where a significant percentage of the population resides in rural areas. Credit unions and post offices provide a wide range of banking services and may be a convenient option for customers who are not online. </p></reply>

Additionally, it is not in the borrower&rsquo;s best interests to apply the costs prior to settlement between the parties concerned or prior to the borrower being in a position to redeem the mortgage and requesting to do so; and</p>  <p>  2.  Pursuant to the terms of the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (the &lsquo;CMCAR&rsquo;), charging interest on the costs at any point is contrary to Regulation 29 (2) of the CMCAR. </p>  <p>  Regulated entities are required to conduct their affairs in a manner that ensures that consumers&rsquo; interests are protected.  The Central Bank recognises that there may be some cases that are more complex than others (such as mortgages that have already been settled) but expects all regulated entities to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected. The Central Bank will continue to challenge regulated entities where consumer focused outcomes are not clearly demonstrated. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Central Bank cannot discuss or share individual responses from regulated entities, as in accordance with Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended) they cannot disclose the details of any subsequent action(s) that they might take.</p></reply>

Additionally, they found that while firms had policies and processes in place for progressing a borrower&rsquo;s case once a completed Standard Financial Statement (SFS) had been received, it was evident in some firms that these processes were not robust and stringent enough to prevent delays. In recognition of the time it may take to complete and assess the SFS and the potential deterioration in a borrower&rsquo;s arrears situation while this process is being carried out, the CCMA specifically allows a lender to agree a temporary arrangement with a borrower, for a limited period, sufficient to allow time for the lender to receive and complete a full review of the SFS. </p><p>As a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s finding, firms were required to put in place the necessary resources, controls and procedures to ensure that borrowers did not experience any undue delays during the period between the borrower submitting the SFS for assessment and when the firm&rsquo;s decision was communicated to the borrower.  The Central Bank issued an industry letter outlining the outcomes and feedback from this themed inspection in 2015, a copy of the letter issued can be found on their website: www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/compliance-monitoring/themed-inspections/code-of-conduct-on-mortgage-arrears/gns4-2-1-2-ccma-ind-ltr.pdf)</p><p>The Central Bank also published Requirements and Standards for Credit Servicing Firms:  (www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/regulation/industry-market-sectors/credit-servicing-firms/legislation/gns-4-4-4authorisation-creditservicingfirms.pdf?sfvrsn=5) in January 2019 and Requirements and Standards for :() in 2017, which require firms to have adequate staffing in place and to ensure that relevant members of staff are fit and proper and have appropriate experience and skills. All firms seeking authorisation as a Credit Servicing Firm or Retail Credit Firm are required to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they are in a position to meet each of the requirements set out prior to being authorised.  The Requirements and Standards must also be complied with on an on-going basis.  </p><p>In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s statutory codes of conduct including the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (CPC) requires firms to ensure it has and employs effectively the resources, policies and procedures necessary for compliance with the CPC. </p><p>The CCMA requires that lenders have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears. Provision 17 of the CCMA requires a lender to establish a centralised and dedicated Arrears Support Unit (ASU), which must be adequately staffed, to manage cases under the MARP. Furthermore, Provision 35 requires that a completed SFS must be assessed in a timely manner by the lender&rsquo;s ASU.  </p><p>I would urge any customer who is not satisfied with the service being provided by their financial institution to firstly make a complaint to their financial institution and if they are not satisfied with the response received, to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  They can be contacted at www.fspo.ie or at 01 567 7000.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, was to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the TCA 1997, which provide that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.  </p>  <p>  Revenue recently announced its decision to defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime until 1 January 2021, to allow time, as part of the annual Tax Strategy Group process, for the examination of a number of policy matters that were raised during Revenue&rsquo;s review .  </p>  <p>  Consequently, there will be no change to FRE allowances for 2020, including the allowances available to teachers.

Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises or increase capacity.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that it can neither direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied, nor can it direct insurance companies as to the pricing level, which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.</p>  <p>  However, insurance reform remains a priority. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  There has been significant progress in the implementation of the two CIWG Reports. Examples include the following:   </p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the Judicial Council and its Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which is due to prepare new draft guidelines for personal injuries awards later this year;</p>  <p>  -  the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is to commence work on  expanding its scope to cover employer and public liability insurance this year;</p>  <p>  -  reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019; </p>  <p>  -  amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  -  the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers;</p>  <p>  -  various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent commitment by the Garda Commissioner to investigate insurance fraud at a divisional level and which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) who will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality; and,</p>  <p>  -  the work currently underway by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.</p>  <p>  These reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from January 2020 show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  It is important to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, I believe good progress has been made with the establishment of a Judicial Council and its decision to nominate 28 April for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee (PIGC). My understanding is that this means that the PIGC will be required by the legislation to submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October.  While the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the Personal Injury Commission&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council.  In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers have to significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputies  that the Cost of Insurance Working Group is continuing to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  The cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations should include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. </p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. </p>  <p>  Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is inherently difficult to estimate the extent of any illegal trade with confidence and it is not possible, therefore, to estimate the potential loss to the Exchequer of illegal trade in alcohol. The extent of the illicit trade in cigarettes is estimated, however, through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Service Executive by IPSOS MRBI. The 2018 survey found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in the State were illicit. This compares to a survey estimate of 13% for 2017 and 10% for 2016. Assuming that the illicit cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, the results of the 2018 survey indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT was approximately &euro;211m.  </p>  <p>  Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The programmes each involved nearly one in ten of some 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences. Tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the new marker in any of them. The results of this sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level. The 2018 sampling programme was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector. A very small number of samples from this programme tested positive. The results of the 2019 sampling programme were broadly in line with previous years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades has achieved a considerable level of success.

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue has recently completed a comprehensive review of their FRE regime. The purpose of the review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, was to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the TCA 1997, which provide that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer. Notwithstanding this review, I understand Revenue is willing to engage with representative bodies of any large groups of employees, including dental hygienists, to consider an application for flat rate employment expenses.    </p>  <p>  Revenue recently announced its decision to defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime until 1 January 2021, to allow time, as part of the annual Tax Strategy Group process, for the examination of a number policy matters that were raised during Revenue&rsquo;s review.  Consequently, there will be no change to FRE allowances for 2020. I am advised by Revenue that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  </p>  <p>  As I have said on previous occasions, there has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation that all employees have a statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 TCA for any valid expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed from any source.  So while certain employees may not be able to claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.</p></reply>

The review also included an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. It included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT. </p>  <p>  The Review Group found significant but geographically uneven increases in residential property price levels which made it difficult to identify a scenario that would deliver on the condition I set that there should be relative stability for all taxpayers in their LPT liabilities and that any increases should be modest, affordable and fair.</p>  <p>  Having considered the findings of the review report, I decided to defer the valuation date from 1st November 2019 to 1st November 2020. This gave sufficient time for the Budgetary Oversight Committee to consider the review report in the context of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations in its report on LPT of 21 March 2018.  Importantly, as a result of my decision, the LPT bills of those liable for the tax will not be increasing in 2020. </p>  <p>  I met with the Committee in June of last year to discuss the review of the Local Property Tax. The Committee also had a separate meeting with officials of the Department of Finance. I received the Committee's scrutiny report on the LPT review in September 2019. </p>  <p>  In order to bring this matter forward, amending legislation will be required and this will need to be in place sufficiently early this year so that the Revenue Commissioners can have the necessary administrative and technical arrangements in place for the 2021 LPT year. This legislation will be a matter for the incoming government.</p></reply>

Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  </p><p>For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p><p>However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. </p><p>The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.</p><p>In relation to entitlement to the State pension for semi-State employees, entitlement to the State pension is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but I can advise that modified rate PRSI contributors who do not have sufficient means may qualify for the means tested State pension (non-contributory).</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p></reply>

Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  </p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. </p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.</p></reply>

Ms Georgieva&rsquo;s response is awaited and while no formal agenda has yet been agreed, I expect that  Ireland&rsquo;s economic outlook and EU and international economic and financial developments would inevitably be discussed. I would also be keen to  discuss Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming 2020 Article IV consultation and the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the Fund&rsquo;s comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a country&rsquo;s financial sector, which is due to commence later this year.

Limiting the exemptions available has kept the tax base as broad as possible and has allowed the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. For this reason I do not intend to legislate for the temporary exemption proposed by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Section 13 of the 2012 Act sets out how residential properties are to be valued for LPT purposes. LPT operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property. When making an assessment, it is expected that the effect of serious and regular flooding on a property would be factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing the property. </p>  <p>  Current property valuations made on the valuation date of 1 May 2013 will continue to apply until 31 October 2020 on foot of S.I. No. 166/2019 - Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (Section 13(3)) Order 2019.

Therefore, Insurance Ireland's initial view is that the recent storms have not lead to a significant increase in claims at this stage. However, they will continue to monitor the situation. </p>  <p>  In the context of the recent storms, the Deputy may wish to note that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, has announced the opening of a Scheme to provide emergency humanitarian assistance for small businesses, sports clubs, community and voluntary organisations unable to secure flood insurance and affected by recent flooding. In addition to this, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has activated the Humanitarian Assistance scheme to support householders affected by flooding. </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about the new rules on retention, the position is as follows. Section 17 of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 provided for these new rules and this recently enacted piece of legislation is subject to Ministerial commencement.  In that regard, I believe that it should be a matter for the new Government to commence that piece of legislation and as such these new rules are not yet active.</p></reply>

Despite having no actual production or associated employment in Ireland, this activity is recorded as production in Ireland under the global national accounting framework (which, in the European Union, is referred to as the European System of Accounts 2010, ESA2010).  When the products are subsequently exported, this is treated as an Irish export.  </p>  <p>  These activities artificially inflate Irish GDP.  GNI*, however, is not inflated by contract manufacturing as this measurement adjusts for foreign-owned intellectual property located in Ireland (the main domestic input into contract manufacturing). </p>  <p>  A large proportion of Irish-outsourced contract manufacturing takes place in China which, of course, was the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak and where significant disruptions to production have taken place. </p>  <p>  Given these disruptions, it is certainly possible that Irish production and exports associated with contract manufacturing could be affected.  If this was to happen, headline GDP would be adversely affected although there would be no impact on GNI* or employment in a direct sense.  If the lost output and sales are not recovered by year-end, it is possible that corporation tax receipts could be affected.</p>  <p>  The extent of the impact on the economy will depend on the duration of the disruptions to production in China (and elsewhere) caused by COVID-19.  My Department will continue to monitor developments and advise accordingly. </p></reply>

This is because the impact will depend on several factors, not least the duration of the epidemic as well as the containment measures put in place to limit its spread. These are simply impossible to estimate and, accordingly, it is extremely difficult to quantify the macroeconomic impact at this point in time. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the OECD has estimated that, in a scenario where economic disruption is mainly confined to China, with only limited spill-overs to other regions, measures put in place to contain the Covid19 virus could take &frac12; a percentage point (pp) off the growth rate of the global economy this year.  </p>  <p>  I would stress, however, that this is a very benign scenario - it is also based on the assumption that the impact is mostly contained to the first quarter of this year, which appears a somewhat heroic assumption.  In a broader contagion scenario, where the economic fall-out is longer-lasting and more widespread, the OECD estimates that this could take 1&frac12; percentage points off the global growth rate. </p>  <p>  As small and export-oriented, the Irish economy is particularly sensitive to external economic conditions. Over the medium-term, the pass-through of a global shock to the domestic economy tends to be broadly one-for-one - i.e. if world demand falls by 1 pp then, over the medium term, Irish economic activity is c. 1 pp below what would otherwise have been the case &ndash; with a less than one-for-one impact in the short-term. Slower growth would, in turn, have negative consequences for the labour market and the public finances.</p>  <p>  While difficult to quantify at this stage, there are likely to be negative impacts for the Irish economy across a range of sectors.  An increasingly integrated world economy means that supply-chains are also increasingly integrated, with many being &lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo;.  Falling production of intermediate goods in China is now affecting the final output in other countries that will also likely impact production facilities in Ireland.  In terms of direct trade links, the share of goods trade with China is around 6 per cent of total trade, based on preliminary data for last year. </p>  <p>  However, indirect exposure to China is potentially more significant. The euro area is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner, accounting for close to a third of total exports.  In turn, China accounts for 9 per cent of total euro area goods and services trade.  The tourism and travel sectors are also likely to be negatively affected as travellers in many parts of the world are likely to take a more cautious approach than would otherwise have been the case.</p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the situation closely and will prepare updated economic forecasts over the next month or so, taking into account all of the latest available information.  It must be stressed, however, that in the current environment, there is much more uncertainty than normal attached to any set of forecasts. </p></reply>

A close, comprehensive set of arrangements underpinning a new EU-UK relationship is in all of our interests. Negotiations began between EU and UK negotiating teams this week. The work of the period ahead will be to achieve an ambitious and fair partnership that works for the benefit of all and that provides a new and strong foundation for this key relationship.</p>  <p>  The Political Declaration envisages an ambitious trading relationship for goods on the basis of a Free Trade Agreement, but until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment.</p>  <p>  My Department has been in contact with the ESRI on the economic impact of the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department and ESRI broadly captures the range of possible future relationships. </p>  <p>  The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research which was published in March last year. </p>  <p>  Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the future relationship between the EU and the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments over the next month or so. These will be published in the SPU in April. </p></reply>

The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the 2nd most competitive country in the EU and the 7th most competitive country in the world.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 25 per cent since 2008.  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures.  In 2019, average annual inflation was just 0.9 per cent.</p>  <p>  On wage developments, average weekly earnings increased by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in 2019. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely as a significant acceleration in wages would undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness relative to other European countries. </p>  <p>  Despite the positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature.

The Council may carry out coastal protection works using its own resources, but where necessary, the Council may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments, including the OPW, for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat. </p>  <p>  Following the severe storms of Winter 2013/2014 and on foot of submissions made by the Local Authority, total funding of &euro;126,792 was allocated by the OPW to Meath County Council for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure. The Council has confirmed that the works at Laytown, including the replacement of gabions/rock armour revetment sea defence systems were carried out using this funding. This, however, was a once off allocation and no further funding is available under this stream. </p>  <p>  It is, however, open to Meath County Council to apply for funding under the Office of Public Works&rsquo; (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects that meet the eligibility criteria, including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. </p></reply>

Access to the site is currently provided during special events such as Heritage Week, local festivals, etc. and it is hoped, in time, this can be expanded.

All Local Authorities, including Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council, may carry out flood mitigation works, using either their own resources, or by applying for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under this scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.opw.ie.</p>  <p>  To the end of 2019, over 580 Minor Works projects have been completed, providing local flooding solutions to over 7,100 properties with expenditure amounting to over &euro;39m since the scheme began in 2009.  In 2019, &euro;4.75m has been approved for 49 projects, with &euro;4.4m having been drawn down by Local Authorities by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  This includes funding of &euro;500,000 approved under this scheme for Monaghan County Council to progress important flood alleviation works in Monaghan Town. These works will consist of the construction of a new culvert across the N54 and the R162 in Monaghan Town and additional flood alleviation measures for the Castle Road area which provides access to the town centre public car parks and shopping area.</p>  <p>  A further application was submitted in February, 2020 by Monaghan County Council for a project at Drumfalda, Ballybay, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. This application is currently under consideration. </p>  <p>  The allocation of funding for the Minor Works scheme is included in the overall allocation for flood risk management investment included under Vote 13 (Office of Public Works) in the Estimates for Public Services for 2020.</p></reply>

Priority has been given to additional funding in the areas of infrastructure, education, childcare and health. This investment delivers on immediate social and economic needs while also providing sustained longer-term benefits to the State. Strong growth in capital spending is a notable feature of the recovery in public spending. This investment has centred on key areas such as social housing, transport and schools and is reflective of the Government&rsquo;s goal of delivering growth-enhancing investment in conjunction with sustainable progress on social priorities.  </p>  <p>  Recent fiscal policy has been based on implementing sustainable growth in expenditure that remains affordable over the medium term. In supporting this position, the Government has strived to ensure that public services are delivered in the most efficient and effective way possible. To this end, a number of reforms have been put in place in recent years, including the Performance Budgeting Initiative, the Equality Budgeting Initiative, the National Economic Dialogue and the Spending Review.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that this approach is maintained in the medium term in order to mitigate against emerging risks in the domestic and global economy. In light of this, it is imperative that both current and capital expenditure is managed within profile this year by all Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The Update to the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy published by the Department of Finance on 9th January set out fiscal projections to 2025. The strategy underpinning these projections is focussed on delivering General Government surpluses that would act as the first line of defence against potential risks to the economy and public finances.</p>  <p>  Within this Fiscal framework it is imperative that sustainable expenditure policies, that continue to deliver improvements in public services and infrastructure, are pursued to support the well-being of the overall Irish economy and continued economic and social progress. </p></reply>

The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by the Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth. </p><p>In further support of this, a wide range of budgetary reforms have been implemented in the last number of years to improve transparency and accountability around the Budget process, while also facilitating best economic practice. This includes initiatives such as performance and equality budgeting and new publications such as the Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. </p><p>Sound public finances are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth in the context of our economic recovery and to progress towards our social and economic goals. This requires effective and efficient management of overall expenditure. To support this goal, my Department has been engaging for the last three years with a range of Departments on the Spending Review process. The aim of this process is reinforce a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. Budget 2020 also saw the publication of the first &lsquo;Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to the Budget&rsquo;; a short, accessible document which put the Budget in simple terms, in order to make the process as accessible as possible. This document also sets out the services that will be delivered to the people of Ireland in an accessible way. For example, in 2020: </p><p>-  108,000 children will be enrolled in the ECCE programme;</p><p>-  137,000 farmers will be supported through various agricultural schemes;</p><p>-  355,000 people will be provided with illness, disability and carer's benefit; and</p><p>-  677,000 people will be provided with pension payments. </p><p>Over the last five years, Irish General Government expenditure as a proportion of GNI* has moved to be broadly in line with the EU average figures for General Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP. In terms of capital expenditure, the overall public capital allocationfor 2020 is &euro;8.2 billion. At this level gross voted capital investment in 2020 will reach c. 4 percent of national income (GNI*) compared to an EU average in recent years of 2.9 percent (GDP).</p></reply>

Information and up-dates on the full range of OPS 2020 activities can also be accessed at the website OPS2020.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Apart from the OPS 2020 framework, reforms are underway in organisations right across the civil and public services. For example, the overall programme of reform that we set out in the 2014 Civil Service Renewal Plan in order to support a higher performing organisation continues to be embedded within our Civil Service.  A fourth progress report that captures the progress made since the Civil Service Renewal Plan commenced was published last May and this is also available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/collection/8a4a55-civil-service-renewal-plan-progress-reports/#fourth-progress-report. An ambitious 10-year strategy and framework for Civil Service Renewal is now being developed which will allow the Civil Service to maintain a clear longer term vision and to achieve significant sustainable transformation in a number of key areas.</p>  <p>  In my role as both Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I have sought to ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is sustainable and that Public Sector policy will continue to facilitate good economic performance in the future. A number of the budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in OPS 2020 will help ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services over the coming years, without impacting negatively on economic performance.</p></reply>

A table providing details of the submissions received, along with the content of each individual submission, including SIPOs submission, is available to view at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/652934-second-review-of-the-regulation-of-lobbying-act-2015/.  </p>  <p>  The issues raised and suggestions for improvements in the submissions received were categorised into nine key thematic areas and the second statutory review was structured around these themes.</p>  <p>  I enclose at APPENDIX 1 a table outlining the recommendations made by SIPO in its submission and the responses provided to each SIPO recommendation in the second statutory review report. The report itself is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/7ef279-second-statutory-review-of-the-regulation-of-lobbying-act-2015/. </p>  <p>  All of the issues raised and the suggestions made in each of the 27 submissions received were examined and considered by my Department. The issues raised mainly concerned implementation and procedural matters. The review found that where issues highlighted had not already been dealt with, they could be effectively managed and resolved on an administrative basis by SIPO. The review includes a number of recommended further actions for SIPO to consider, along with two recommendations for my Department.</p>  <p>  Overall, there was widespread acceptance of and support for the legislation in the submissions received. I am satisfied that now is not the time to consider amending this legislation and I agree with my Department's assertion that the amendment of any legislation should only be considered where a compelling business case for change is clear and unequivocal.

Full details of this scheme are available on www.opw.ie</p>  <p>  To the end of 2019, over 580 Minor Works projects have been completed, providing local flooding solutions to over 7,100 properties with expenditure amounting to over &euro;39m since the scheme began in 2009.  In 2019, &euro;4.75m has been approved for 49 projects, with &euro;4.4m having been drawn down by Local Authorities by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The allocation of funding for the Minor Works scheme is included in the overall allocation for flood risk management investment included under Vote 13 (Office of Public Works) in the Estimates for Public Services for 2020.</p>  <p>  Full information on the scheme is available at: https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/0e3b3d-minor-flood-mitigation-works-and-coastal-protection-scheme/. </p></reply>

Ensuring that the design, environmental and planning elements are correct now limits the risk to critical delays or challenges later in the project cycle.  Since the commencement of the project the consultants have undertaken survey work, data collection and analysis in preparation for the first public information day which took place in November 2019.</p>  <p>  The consultants are currently carrying out more detailed surveys in order to calibrate the flood model, this will inform the selection of a preferred option. Additionally, the consultants, along with the Council, have been collecting data from the most recent flood event to assist in ascertaining the flow paths and velocities of the river in a flood event. This will aid further in the design of the proposed solution.</p>  <p>  I can assure you that the OPW and Laois County Council are working with the consultants in order to ensure that the scheme is progressed as efficiently as possible. </p></reply>

These Work Programmes are  available at www.opw.ie.</p>  <p>  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen, studies to explore managing flood risk at the Callows and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir.  </p>  <p>  In January 2020, Mr. Kevin &lsquo;Boxer&rsquo; Moran TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief, announced that he has secured government support for &euro;7 million investment to advance a planned programme of maintenance works and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows Region between Athlone and Meelick Weir to improve the conveyancing of the River Shannon. This investment, following full environmental assessment and planning, as well as helping to mitigate Summer, low level, flooding to support the tourism, navigation and agricultural sectors for this region. </p>  <p>  In relation to plans to address flood risk nationally, in  May 2018 the Government launched a &euro;1billion investment programme in flood relief measures and schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, to protect properties and communities assessed by the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme to be at significant risk from flooding, that is , from the 100 year flood event.</p>  <p>  CFRAM was the largest study of flood risk management undertaken in Ireland and followed best international practice. It assessed the flood risk for those 300 communities most likely to be impacted from flooding in the future, and included 90 coastal communities. </p>  <p>  The flood risk in these communities represents 80% of the risk from our primary cause of flooding - and they are home to almost two thirds of our population.</p>  <p>  For these communities CFRAM assessed both the flood risk and its impact for today and in the future from climate change using two internationally recognised climate change scenarios.</p>  <p>   CFRAM also provided the evidence to recommend 118 flood relief schemes in addition to the 33 already underway at that time; and other solutions that can manage that risk. The details of these were published in May 2018 in 29 Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs). The details of the flood risk and the FRMP by location are available on the OPW website www.floodinfo.ie.</p>  <p>  45 flood relief schemes, costing over &euro;400m have been completed protecting approximately 10,000 properties and avoiding damages and losses estimated at &euro;2billion approximately.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the FRMPs in May 2018, the OPW and Local Authorities have been pro-actively engaged to advance the implementation of schemes and have almost tripled from 33 to 92, the number of major flood relief schemes at design and construction.  Project Steering Groups have been established and are working to oversee the implementation of the projects.  This collaboration and NDP allocated funding will allow the OPW and Local Authorities to complete these 92 schemes currently in the pipeline and bring the balance of 59 schemes, identified by the FRMPs through design and construction.  </p>  <p>  In addition to advancing with major schemes, the OPW also works closely with Local Authorities to support local flood relief projects up to a maximum of &euro;750,000 per project under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The total amount of funding drawn down to date by Local Authorities under this Scheme since 2009 is &euro;39 million in respect of over 580 completed projects. These are providing local flood relief to some 7,000 properties. Approximately two thirds of these are outside of those areas to be protected by major flood relief schemes.</p></reply>

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff. </p>  <p>  The current pension increase policy was agreed by the Government in the context of its commitments made under the PSSA, which runs until the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Single Pension Scheme introduced for new entrants to the public service from 1 January 2013 onwards is a career average pension scheme which provides that both the referable amounts that are accrued by serving staff while in employment, as well as pensions in payment, are uprated in line with changes in the consumer price index.</p></reply>

The Act prescribes a set of steps to follow which includes extensive consultation with schools and their patron bodies. </p><p>The initial step in the process is for the NCSE to inform the Minister that there is a shortage of places in a particular area.  </p><p>The NCSE will only activate the legislation after it has taken all reasonable efforts to get schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide additional special class or school places.</p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The NCSE's Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs in relation to special class provision.</p><p>As the Deputy's query relates to a school placement for an individual pupil, it has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply. </p><p>The provision of therapeutic supports is a matter for  the HSE.</p></reply>

A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspect of this model has been arranged. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the culmination of this work will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>The survey of Secretaries and Caretakers identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The following links will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on 10 January, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21 January 2020.</p></reply>

This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Additionally some pupils with developmental issues may require an assessment of need, which is provided by the HSE services. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with difficulties including those with developmental delay. Teachers consult with their NEPS psychologist for assistance should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become directly involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological support. I would advise that parents of children in schools for whom concerns exist in relation to developmental delay should, in the first instance, raise the matter with the principal of the relevant school with a view to involving the assigned NEPS psychologist in the issue, where appropriate.</p></reply>

The outcome of this initial tendering process, which was completed late last year, has been disappointing and has not provided NABMSE with options for the establishment of a group scheme, which at a minimum, would provide for a stabilisation of premium rates for individual schools.</p>  <p>  My Department was updated on the outcome of this tendering process at a meeting last December </p>  <p>  In 2019, a number of special schools contacted my Department directly, advising of financial difficulties arising from significant increases in insurance premiums, ranging between 30% to over 700% in the last 2 years. My Department has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to a small number of special schools, where they have made direct contact, advising of increases in their insurance costs. </p>  <p>  The capitation grant is provided to schools to cater for day to day running costs. Where an advance in capitation is made, my Department will take into account the amount of capitation due to the respective schools, and the impact a full recoupment at once might have on the ability of those schools to meet other costs. With this in mind, my Department will engage with individual schools on methods of recoupment that are manageable.</p>  <p>   It is not sustainable however for my Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are continuing to engage as a matter of urgency, with NABMSE and relevant Government departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the State Claims Agency, in order to achieve a resolution for impacted special schools.</p>  <p>  All Boards of Managements of schools are obliged to comply with Section 18 of the Education Act 1998 which requires a board to keep all proper and usual accounts and to ensure all such accounts are properly audited or certified in accordance with best accounting practice. Boards are also required to comply with the arrangements set out in my Department&rsquo;s circulars 0060/2017 and 0002/2018 in relation to the operation of the Financial Services Support Unit (FSSU).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-03-05a.628.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1548" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020030500060#WRL03700"><p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. </p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p><p>In Spring 2019 I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>The survey of Secretaries and Caretakers identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The following links will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on 10 January, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21 January 2020.</p></reply>

Not all children/young people attending CAMHS are medically fit to avail of education during all of their stay. </p>  <p>  Since 2014, my Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide teaching staff in CAMHS facilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 on the basis of the number of inpatient beds in each CAMHS unit. The school refered to by the deputy is one such school.</p>  <p>  Current policy does not provide for an additional teaching allocation for CAMHS facilities for children/young people attending as day or out-patients, as young people attending CAMHs as day patients can apply for Home Tuition support to provide for compensatory education in respect of time missed from school, due to medical reasons or attendance at a medical unit. </p>  <p>  As not all inpatient beds in CAMHS Units may be filled at any given time, in such instances, subject to prior approval by my Department, CAMHS Units may utilise spare teaching capacity from their allocated 6:1 ratio to offer guidance or support for children/young people attending CAMHS facilities as day patients, and to assist in maintaining some continuity of education from their base school or liaison with their base school on days that they attend the CAMHS Unit. </p>  <p>  Students in the special school referred to by the Deputy are attending the HSE CAMHS facility, in the first instance, as in-patients, day patients or out-patients for mental health issues. </p>  <p>  While the special school in question was originally designated as a special school for Severe Emotional Behaviour Disturbance, since the school&rsquo;s re-location with the HSE&rsquo;s CAMHS unit, the teaching staff allocation has been provided on the basis of the policy outlined above for CAMHS facilities.</p>  <p>  The CAMHS team may refer patients to the school for short term education intervention, designed to provide for some continuity of education, while a patient of the CAMHS Unit. All students remain enrolled in their base schools while attending the CAMHS unit. Special schools attached to CAMHS Units do not enrol students on a full time basis, as their main education placement. Therefore, the school's enrolment remains transient. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  Children are eligible when they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class in mainstream or special school that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs.  Eligibility is determined in consultation with the NCSE through its network of SENOs. </p>  <p>  As students in special schools attached to a CAMHS facility, including the School referred to by the Deputy, are, in the first instance, attending CAMHS as in-patients, day patients or out-patients for mental health issues, transport to the HSE CAMHS unit does not come within the remit of my Department&rsquo;s Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. </p>  <p>  In previous years, Special School Transport was provided in error to a number of students who attended this special school while day patients of CAMHS. This arrangement was allowed to continue for these students until they completed their time in CAMHS. </p>  <p>  My Department has informed the school that its enrolment policy is to be brought in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy for the provision of education to children and young people who are in-patients in the CAMHS unit in Merlin Park for the 2020/21 school year onwards; and submit a copy of same once it is complete.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the school has been advised that, as an exceptional measure, applications for students who were enrolled in this school for the first time in 2019/20 will now also be considered but no further applications will be considered for the 2020/21 school year onwards.</p></reply>

It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, well-being and mental health. In particular, learners are enabled to use and analyse information in new and creative ways, to investigate issues, to explore, to think for themselves, to be creative in solving problems and to apply their learning to new challenges and situations.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Framework for Junior Cycle provides students with an excellent foundation for progression to Senior Cycle.</p></reply>

The Act prescribes a set of steps to follow which includes extensive consultation with schools and their patron bodies. </p><p>The initial step in the process is for the NCSE to inform the Minister that there is a shortage of places in a particular area.  </p><p>The NCSE will only activate the legislation after it has taken all reasonable efforts to get schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide additional special class or school places.</p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me.

The Progress Report does not draw any definitive conclusions and the preliminary findings are tentative.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is also examining implications following ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2018, Article 24(2) of this convention obliges states, inter alia, to ensure that children can access an inclusive, quality and free education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently engaged in a public consultation with parents, students, people with disabilities, educators and other educational partners and stakeholders. The focus of this consultation focuses on how best to move forward in the education of students currently being educated in special schools and classes. The special schools to which the Deputy refers have been included in this consultation process. </p>  <p>   Following this public consultation and further deliberations by NCSE, the policy advice will be finalised and submitted to the Minister by June 2020.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that at this stage, the NCSE has not made any recommendations regarding the future of any special school.</p></reply>

In short, a suite of both education and health therapeutic supports was required to support children with special educational needs.</p><p>The allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes to primary and post primary schools from 2020/21 onwards will be based on the school profile used for the allocation of Special Education Teachers. The additional 1,064 SNA posts provided in Budget 2020 will facilitate the transition to the new allocation model as well as meeting other priorities.</p><p>Under the new allocation model:</p><p>- No schools will receive an allocation of SNA support for mainstream classes which is less than their existing 2019/20 mainstream SNA allocation on the introduction of the frontloaded model and some schools will gain</p><p>- Parents will not be required to secure a diagnosis of disability in order to access SNA support &ndash; the link between diagnosis and resources will be broken</p><p>- Where schools have an SNA, SNA support will be available immediately to students in mainstream classes upon their arrival in school thereby reducing delays in accessing support. </p><p>- Schools will have greater autonomy and flexibility in how their SNA allocation is deployed to meeting the needs of the students in their schools. </p><p>- Frontloading will reduce the administrative burden on schools who have to follow up on assessments under the current application-based process.</p><p>- SNAs will have more certainty around their tenure of employment and the new model does not change their roles and functions.</p><p>- Frontloading will free up valuable resources in the system which are currently involved in carrying out assessments (HSE and NEPS) and administering an assessment based allocation system so children can access SNA support.  These valuable resources can now be redirected to meeting other priority needs and to providing increased supports for families and schools.</p><p>These new arrangements will not impact on the way SNAs are currently allocated to special classes and special schools. Professional assessments will continue to be required in these cases and the normal application process will continue.</p><p>To support the implementation of the new model the Department held a broadly based consultation with key stakeholders on 4<sup>th</sup>and 5<sup>th</sup>February. </p><p>The purpose of the consultation was to, brief stakeholders on how the allocation model will operate, to explore the nature of any challenges and opportunities expected to arise during the implementation phase and any action that may be required in this regard, to consider the supports and information required to support effective implementation and to consider any other relevant issues. </p><p>A number of stakeholders who attended the consultation sessions made submissions to Department on the new model and further individual meetings are currently taking place with the stakeholders concerned.</p><p>Following the consideration of the outcome of the consultation a circular will be developed for issue to schools.  The circular will outline, inter alia, the content of the model, the scope for appeals and school reviews, training and supports to be provided. It is expected that SNA allocations for 2020/21 will be made shortly afterwards.</p></reply>

The outcome of this initial tendering process, which was completed late last year, has been disappointing and has not provided NABMSE with options for the establishment of a group scheme, which at a minimum, would provide for a stabilisation of premium rates for individual schools.</p><p>My Department was updated on the outcome of this tendering process at a meeting last December. </p><p>In 2019, a number of special schools contacted my Department directly, advising of financial</p><p>difficulties arising from significant increases in insurance premiums, ranging between 30% to over 700% in the last 2 years. My Department has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to a small number of affected special schools, where they have made direct contact, advising of significant increases in their insurance costs.</p><p>The capitation grant is provided to schools to cater for day to day running costs.

However, this is not the method of funding that applies to the Community and Comprehensive or the ETB sectors. In the case of the Community and Comprehensive Sector the Department provides funding on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also takes into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as condition of buildings, size of school etc.</p><p>The ETB allocations are made on a budget basis in respect of head office and other costs, including those relating to schools. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets and each ETB is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. Any funding issues for an individual school have to be managed from within the relevant ETB&rsquo;s budget.  The Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools in the ETB sector.</p><p><b>TRANSLATED ANSWER:</b></p><p>Sna socruithe cisti&uacute;ch&aacute;in at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Roinn le haghaidh me&aacute;nscoileanna deonacha, scoileanna cuimsitheacha agus pobail agus le haghaidh scoileanna agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; na mBord Oideachais agus Oili&uacute;na (BOO) l&eacute;ir&iacute;tear na socruithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la bainist&iacute;ochta agus &uacute;in&eacute;ireachta a bhaineann le scoileanna an dara leibh&eacute;il.</p><p>Maoin&iacute;tear me&aacute;nscoileanna deonacha i sc&eacute;im an tSaoroideachais, at&aacute; faoi &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht agus bhainist&iacute;ocht phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach, tr&iacute; dheontais per capita.  &Iacute;octar deontas per capita breise le scoileanna in earn&aacute;il na me&aacute;nscoileanna deonacha ina m&uacute;intear tr&iacute; Ghaeilge go hioml&aacute;n n&oacute; i bp&aacute;irt.

Section 7 of the Teaching Council Act provides for the Council to establish procedures in relation to the induction of teachers into the teaching profession. Those procedures are now in place through the Droichead Framework. The Droichead Framework, as established by the Teaching Council, sets out the requirement for newly qualified teachers (NQTs), which includes both school-based and additional professional learning activities, to address the needs of NQTs as they begin their careers.</p>  <p>  Following a review, the Teaching Council approved a revised Droichead Policy in December 2016. The Council approved the implementation of the Policy in May 2017. Under the revised Policy;</p>  <p>  - The Department has committed to providing in-school release time and a range of other supports via the National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) to support schools as they engage in the process.</p>  <p>  - There is more flexibility around the way the Droichead model can operate in different schools and the size of the Professional Support Team (PST). In addition there is flexibility where there is the usage of an external PST member to act as a mentor where necessary.</p>  <p>  - There is an extended 5 year growth phase whereby Droichead will now be the sole route of induction for all NQTs by 2020/21. The growth phase is in year 4 with all primary schools that have administrative principals and post primary schools with 200+ students in Droichead for the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  - In February 2020, there were 928 primary schools and 607 post primary schools offering Droichead.</p>  <p>  - In 2020 the approved budget for NIPT is over &euro;1.5m. Secondment costs and substitution costs contribute to a further c&euro;2.6m.</p>  <p>  The requirements of this framework, including the teaching time requirements, are a matter for the Teaching Council in line with its statutory remit for the induction of NQTs into the teaching profession and the registration of teachers.</p></reply>

This list is not exhaustive.</p>  <p>  A central purpose underlying the provision of this additional time is to provide for these essential activities to take place without reducing class contact/tuition time.</p>  <p>  The additional time amounts to 36 hours per year for primary teachers and 33 hours per year for post-primary teachers. The operational arrangements for these hours are set out in Circular 0008/2011 (primary teachers) and Circular 0025/2011 (post-primary teachers).</p>  <p>  Greater flexibility for the usage of the additional hours was subsequently introduced.

In 2018 and 2019 Letterkenny Institute of Technology received a total of &euro;0.75 million in Exchequer funding under the Higher Education Authority calls for proposals for higher education landscape restructuring projects. The projects funded were aimed at strengthening collaborative cross-border strategic alliance building and co-operation between higher education and further education and training institutions such as  Letterkenny IT, Donegal ETB, North West Regional College and Ulster University, including in the wider context of strengthening the reach of any future TU if established in the region.</p>  <p>  As stated in the &ldquo;New Decade, New Approach&rdquo; agreement in relation to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland, the Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry. This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government and looks forward to early discussion at the North  South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes, Wexford town is located in the Wexford school planning area. </p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four year period 2019 to 2022. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Wexford school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

This compares with a processing date of 27 February 2019 at a similar time last year.</p><p>More generally, the processing time for visas in each location will vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, seasonal pressures, the complexity of the applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available. While every effort is made to process such applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary during the year and from one location to another.</p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria. Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted.  The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction.  Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the 1986 Act on 2 October 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act. </p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation).  This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.  Under the Regulation, divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation.  Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation. </p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 provided for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the United Kingdom, in the event of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union occurring without an agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union setting out the arrangements for such withdrawal.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 with such an agreement in place. Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 will therefore not be commenced. Issues relating to the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK after the end of the transition period are currently under consideration in my Department. </p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to their optimum use.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.</p><p>The Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is based on agreed Garda priorities.  It continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by significant Exchequer funding across the Garda and OPW Votes.</p><p>I understand from the supplementary information provided by the Deputy that he refers in particular to Laytown.  The programme does not include building works at Laytown Garda Station and I am informed by the Garda authorities that no works are ongoing or are planned for that station at this time.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  We now have approximately 14,300 Garda members nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff and these numbers continue to grow.</p><p>Extensive information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website in relation to the numbers of Garda members and their assignment nationwide at the following link: .  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Details in relation to the number of Garda staff nationwide are also available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i></p><p>The Garda authorities have pointed out that ratios such as the number of Garda members per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources, as they do not take account of other factors including, for example, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size.  </p><p>Nonetheless I can confirm that there has been a significant increase in Garda resources in Meath in recent years.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of the end of January 2020, a total of 324 Garda members were assigned to the Meath Division, in addition to 41 Garda staff.  By contrast, in December 2015 there were a total of 277 Garda members and 26 Garda staff in the Division.  I understand that further resources were most recently allocated to Meath Division on 24 February 2020, when 14 trainee Garda members were allocated to Meath Division.  Six of these were allocated to Ashbourne District, in which Laytown is located.  </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout by the Garda Commissioner of the new Garda Operating Model meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future</i>, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This model has been long recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and while new to Ireland, it is the standard in other countries.  The new Operating Model is designed to provide a more responsive, localised policing service to communities and it streamlines Garda administration and re-organises resources in order to do so. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Meath Division is one of four Divisions earmarked for the introduction of the new Operating Model during the current year.  I am confident that adoption by the Commissioner of this new structure will lead to an improved policing service in Meath as well as in other communities nationwide.</p></reply>

The new Operating Model is designed to provide a more responsive, localised policing service to communities and it streamlines Garda administration and re-organises resources in order to do so. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Meath Division is one of four Divisions earmarked for the introduction of the new Operating Model during the current year.  I am confident that adoption by the Commissioner of this new structure will lead to an improved policing service in Meath as well as in other communities nationwide.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's query in relation to allocation of additional Garda&iacute;, it is important to note that in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and as set out above, the Commissioner is responsible for management of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and as such, decisions on assignment of Garda&iacute; nationwide throughout 2020 are entirely a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>At present the Stamullen area is located within the Laytown Sub-District, which in turn is part of Ashbourne District.</p><p>The Garda authorities have pointed out that ratios such as the number of Garda members per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources, as they do not take account of other factors including, for example, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size.  </p><p>I have nonetheless been informed that additional resources are being assigned to the Division and that, most recently on 24 February 2020, 14 trainee Garda members were allocated to Meath Division, six of whom were allocated to Ashbourne District.  I am further informed that an additional five members had been allocated to Laytown Sub-District on 7 January 2020.  </p><p>I am also informed that Laytown operates on a &lsquo;paired&rsquo; system with Duleek, which enables a 24/7 service to be provided between the two Sub-Districts.  Additional support is provided as required from Ashbourne Garda Station, which is operational 24/7.  Further, the area is patrolled by Divisional Units such as the Divisional Roads Policing Unit and the Divisional Drugs Unit as required. </p><p>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the number of Garda&iacute; allocated nationwide, including in Meath, is kept under regular review by the Commissioner and that the Garda authorities have indicated to me that it is intended to allocate further resources as they become available under the new Operating Model.</p></reply>

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  </p><p>There are now approximately 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.  It may be noted that the increasing number of Garda staff is allowing the Commissioner to redeploy Garda&iacute; from administrative to mainstream policing duties, where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.  Taken together, this increase in the number of both Garda members and staff is delivering a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide. </p><p>Details in relation to the number of Garda members assigned to the Cork Garda Divisions are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>http://justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Garda_Workforce  </p><p>Details in relation to the number of Garda staff assigned to the Cork Garda Divisions are also available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and as noted above, the Commissioner is responsible for management of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and as such, decisions on assignment of Garda&iacute; nationwide throughout 2020 as requested by the Deputy are entirely a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p></reply>

The most significant reforming measure has been the introduction of a single application procedure under the International Protection Act 2015.  Under the single procedure, all elements of a person's protection claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are considered together rather than sequentially as heretofore. </p><p>A person who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation/decision on their application within approximately 15 months, provided no complications arise. Prioritised cases are currently being processed in just over 9 months. Prioritised applications include those from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors and applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria and Eritrea. The International Protection Office (IPO) is working hard to try to achieve a target of 9 months in the vast majority of cases while acknowledging that the processing of applications is complex and that each application deserves and receives an individual assessment.</p><p>In addition, the IPO commenced interviews by video conference in November 2019, with applicants from the south of Ireland attending their interview in Cork. The IPO then embarked on the next stage of the project and engaged with the Courts Service to conduct interviews from video suites in courthouses, commencing with Sligo in early 2020.  The first video conference interviews from Sligo courthouse took place in January 2020 and further interviews are scheduled for early March.  This provides greater flexibility to meet the needs of international protection applicants who reside outside of Dublin.  </p><p>In addition, I sought and achieved an additional &euro;1m in Budget 2020 under the Justice and Equality vote which will allow for extra staffing resources to further improve processing times.</p><p>Annual statistics in respect of applications for international protection made in 2018 and 2017 (under the International Protection Act 2015) are available online from the International Protection Office at <i>www.ipo.gov.ie</i></p><p>Annual statistics in respect of applications for asylum made in 2016 (under the Refugee Act 1996) are available online on the website for the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at <i>www.orac.ie</i></p><p>However, I set out in the following table the number of persons who have applied for International Protection under the International Protection Act 2015 and the number who were successful and unsuccessful in those years. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number Applied</th>       <th>Successful</th>       <th>Unsuccessful</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>4,782 (*provisional) </td>       <td>1,115 </td>       <td>1,779</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>3,673 </td>       <td>1,041</td>       <td>545</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>2,926 </td>       <td>767</td>       <td>401</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>2,244 </td>       <td>728</td>       <td>1,432 </td>    </tr> </table> * The figures provided for 2019 are provisional and are subject to change due to data cleansing. </p><p>Final decisions made by my Department relate only to decisions made in the year, not when the application was made. </p><p>The Deputy will note that there was an increase in applications in 2019 of just over 30% on applications in 2018 and an increase over the four year period of 113%.  </p><p>The Department completed decisions in  82.5% more cases in 2019 over the figure in 2018.</p></reply>

The Policing Authority assumed responsibility for undertaking these competitions on 1 January 2017 and, coinciding with that date, the eligibility criteria were extended to include any member of the PSNI not below the rank of inspector who has served not less than 2 years in that rank. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that arrangements are in place to allow for the secondment of officers from the PSNI to certain ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a period not exceeding 3 years. The Inter-Governmental Agreement on Police Co-operation obliged both Governments to introduce the necessary administrative and legislative measures to provide for exchanges, secondments and appointments between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  Sections 52 - 54 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 gives effect to these obligations.  Protocols are in place between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI which provide for the implementation of a programme of personnel exchanges and secondments between the two police services. </p>  <p>  Perhaps most importantly in this context, as the Deputy will be aware, in December 2018 the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the report is now being implemented in accordance with the targets and timelines set out in the 4-year plan "A Policing Service for the Future".</p>  <p>  Among the issues highlighted in the report was that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society and should therefore develop recruitment strategies to achieve a more diverse intake.  These recommendations echoed those of the Garda Inspectorate following their examination of entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, published in July 2018.  That review recommended the extension of reciprocal arrangements to allow access to the sergeant and inspector promotion processes in both jurisdictions (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PSNI).</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation plan a broad review of entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be carried out, which I expect will consider this and other issues.</p></reply>

It is underpinned by key principles which include using detention as a last resort and diverting children away from involvement in criminal activity.</p><p>The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, which focuses on preventing criminal behaviour as well as diversion from the criminal justice system and rehabilitation of children between 10 and 18 years of age. The Garda Youth Diversion Programme is supported by a network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).  These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. </p><p>The second main filter provided in the Children Act is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts. Part 9 of the Children Act 2001 provides for a suite of community sanctions including Probation Order, Mentoring Order and Detention and Supervision Order. The Probation Order with specified conditions is used most frequently, as it provides flexibility in tailoring the intervention to meet the individual needs of the young person concerned.</p><p>Young Persons Probation (YPP) is a division of the Probation Service which was established in 2006. YPP supervise the community sanctions contained in the Children Act 2001. I am assured that the Probation Service at all times works to support each young person to comply with their court order. Non-compliance with a community sanction can however result in the young person being returned to court, at which time they may be afforded a further opportunity to comply, the order may be varied by the presiding judge, or a period of detention may be imposed. </p><p>I have consulted with the Probation Service with regard to the data requested by the Deputy.

I expect a draft of the Strategy to be published before too long for a further round of consultations, with a view to it being finalised and brought to Government for approval as soon as possible thereafter. </p><p>The new Strategy will include consideration of how youth justice policy might be more closely aligned to other child and youth policies, including targeted policies to support children and families who experience multiple disadvantage and links between schools and other services  and programmes. A particular challenge is how to ensure an effective response to the needs of the harder-to-engage cohort of children and young people, and ensuring that the Strategy focuses on this as a priority.  The Strategy will include measures to address fragmentation within current services and programme delivery at local and national level so as to support a holistic response to the needs of particular children at risk, in the specific family and community context, rather than separate responses to different aspects of need at different ages and stages of the family cycle. </p></reply>

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. </p>  <p>  There are currently 105 GYDPs in place nationwide with a budget of approximately &euro;15.5 million in 2019 funded by my Department.  This supports approximately 265 FTE youth justice worker posts - the number can vary throughout the year. In relation to Ballymun, the specific area referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that my Department currently funds one GYDP, with funding supporting 4 FTE posts.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in the last two years to extend the Garda Youth Diversion Project network to ensure that the service is available throughout the State.  This has been achieved by extending existing project catchment areas and allocation of additional staff.  There are a small number of areas where this approach would not be suitable and these are being considered for the establishment of new projects instead.  </p>  <p>  Catchment areas for projects are determined in consultation with local community groups, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders on a case-by-case basis. As the GYDPs have evolved organically since their inception, catchment areas vary depending on the project&rsquo;s background and local needs.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the GYDP model has been developed and extended, with a renewed emphasis on family support and early intervention/preventative work, as well as on working with harder-to-engage young people, including those not suitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Where any new projects are being established, the minimum core of the project will now include 2 youth justice workers, a family support worker, an early intervention support worker and an outreach worker to engage with harder-to-reach young people.</p>  <p>  In relation to future policy in this area, I have chaired an expert steering group over the past twelve months to lead my Department's work developing a new Youth Justice Strategy and I expect a draft of the Strategy to be published in the near future for a further round of consultations, with a view to it being finalised and published thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The new Strategy will include a focus on how youth justice policy can more closely align to other child and youth policies, including targeted policies to support children and families who experience multiple disadvantage and links between schools and other services and programmes. A particular priority is responding effectively to the needs of the harder-to-engage cohort of children and young people.  The Strategy will include measures to address fragmentation within current services and programme delivery at local and national level so as to support a holistic response to the needs of particular children at risk, in the specific family and community context, rather than separate responses to different aspects of need at different ages and stages of the family cycle. </p></reply>

Such persons ordinarily do not make themselves known to officials of the Immigration Service. As the Deputy will appreciate, irregular migration, by its very nature, is clandestine. It is not uncommon for people who are here illegally to go to extreme lengths to avoid contact with the authorities. Consequently, it is inherently difficult to quantify the extent of irregular migration.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise, that when it comes to people living here illegally, the only option for regularisation is on a case-by-case basis. Ireland along with other Member States of the EU, has committed, under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (2008), to a case-by-case approach as opposed to mass regularisation.</p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their status.</p></reply>

Every effort is being made to re-accommodate applicants from these temporary locations to a dedicated accommodation centre as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that residents who have been granted an international protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) or a permission to remain have the same access to housing supports and services as Irish and EEA nationals.  However, due to a difficulty in accessing other accommodation, there are 1,018* residents in accommodation centres with a protection status or humanitarian permission to remain in the State. These form part of the overall figure of 5,645 in such centres.</p>  <p>  Considerable work is being undertaken to support these residents to move out of accommodation centres and into secure permanent accommodation.  My Department has a specific team who work in collaboration with Depaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Peter McVerry Trust, officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association to collectively support residents with status or permission to remain to access housing options.  A total of 837 persons with status moved into the community during 2019 and a further 191* people have, to date, moved to community-based accommodation this year.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that there are also 390 people accommodated in the Balseskin Reception Centre in Co. Dublin as of 1 March, 2020.  During their stay in Balseskin, protection applicants are offered health screening and are processed for PPS numbers and medical cards.  The purpose of Balseskin is to provide a short orientation period before residents are accommodated in centres around the country.</p>  <p>  Balseskin plays a pivotal role in the direct provision process as it allows for the delivery of necessary supports and services to persons newly arrived in the state. The issuing of PPS numbers and medical cards allows those seeking international protection in Ireland to access direct provision allowances and medical supports once accommodated in a centre.</p>  <p>  *These figures are provisional and may be subject to change.</p></reply>

I am further informed that individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may note that the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 provides that a person is not obliged to disclose certain convictions which are over seven years old, subject to certain specified limitations.</p>  <p>  The 2016 Act also made a series of amendments to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 in respect of the arrangements for the disclosure or otherwise of past convictions in the context of the vetting process. In particular, it inserted a new section 14A providing for non-disclosure of certain offences after a period of seven years. These provisions are applied by the National Vetting Bureau in its work.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a conviction may be a spent conviction does not mean it ceases to be part of the person's criminal record.  Rather, if the conviction is eligible to be spent, a person will not be penalised in law or incur any liability for failing to disclose a spent conviction.  Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that if a person applies for a position in certain specified bodies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Courts Service, they must disclose spent convictions. The list of bodies that a person must disclose spent convictions to is set out in Schedule 2 of the Act.</p>  <p>  The person referred to by the Deputy may wish to contact the Garda National Vetting Bureau directly at Locall 1890 488488 or by email at vetting@garda.ie.</p></reply>

This Impact Assessment is designed to assist Government in formulating its position on future ratification of the Agreement, once the EU Commission presents the final legal texts and it is anticipated that the Impact Assessment will be concluded in advance of the November 2020 meeting of the Trade Council where it is expected that the EU-Mercosur Agreement will be submitted for consideration by Ministers. </p></reply>

Located in the 31 Local Authorities Offices nationwide, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (up to 10 employees) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories:</p><p>-  Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea)</p><p>-  Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up) </p><p>-  Business Development grants for existing businesses that want to expand. </p><p>It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. For further information on eligibility criteria see the LEOs Website www.localenterprise.ie.</p><p>I am informed that there has been engagement with Mr. McGregor by his local LEO in Limerick in respect to his query.</p><p>The LEO in Limerick has recommended the Start Your Own Business Programmes/Courses to Mr. McGregor together with advice on a number of training and mentoring programmes.</p><p><b>Start Your Own Business Programmes/Courses</b></p><p>The programme will guide an entrepreneur through the various aspects of business and business planning.  The objective is to assist people in assessing their idea, its viability and to decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The following is the typical content and breakdown of a Start your own Business training programme.</p><p>-  Identifying, understanding and researching your target market</p><p>-  Tax, law and insurance</p><p>-  Financial planning (pricing, costing)</p><p>-  Sources of funding</p><p>-  Promoting your business</p><p>-  Sales and service</p><p>-  Basic bookkeeping</p><p>-  Developing your Business Plan.</p><p>All LEOs also offer a number of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training or mentoring such as:</p><p><b>-  The Mentor Programme</b>which is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.</p><p><b>-  The LEO Management Development programmes</b>which provide the owner-manager with the management, leadership, business skills and knowledge to achieve sustainability and growth in their business. </p><p><b>-  LEAN for Micro</b>which is a targeted programme for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well as building resilience within their companies.</p><p>Further to this, if a potential business is not eligible for direct grant aid, an entrepreneur with a viable business proposal can also use their LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favorable interest rate from MFI of 6.8% if they make their application through the LEOs.</p><p>I would also suggest the <b>&lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool</b>which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible. The tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie. By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p><p>- find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p><p>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p><p>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further; and,</p><p>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use. </p><p>Further information on all the services available from the LEOs can be accessed at www.localenterprise.ie or at Local Enterprise Office Limerick</p></reply>

Similarly, LEO Meath provides the same business supports throughout the County including the Laytown/Bettystown Municipal District having engaged in numerous mentor assignments and training programmes for LEO clients based in East Meath. </p><p>I note that you have inquired about funding for a new LEO to cover the Drogheda and East Meath region. You will be aware that when the LEO network was instituted under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014, a LEO was established on the basis of the functional area of the 31 County and City Councils in Ireland.  This model, in operation for over 5 years, has been the platform for ongoing and incremental success in terms of client engagement and strong local jobs growth. </p><p>There are a wide range of Brexit supports available to further strengthen the capacity of our microenterprise sector such as:</p><p><b>- The Brexit Mentor Programme</b>was developed for businesses to work with an experienced mentor on a one-to-one basis to identify key areas of exposure within their business and to maximise potential opportunities arising from Brexit.</p><p><b>- Prepare Your Business for Customs</b>is a one-day interactive workshop, run regionally by Local Enterprise Offices, which provides all businesses with a better understanding of the potential impacts, formalities and procedures to be adopted when trading with a country which is outside the Single Market and Custom Unions.</p><p><b>- LEAN for Micro</b>is a targeted programme for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well as building resilience within their companies.</p><p><b>- Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME)</b>Grant supports clients to explore and develop new export market opportunities, such as participation in international trade fairs and development of export related marketing and websites. With a focus on helping companies to diversify, this scheme is a match-funding opportunity with up to &euro;2,500 available.</p><p><b>- Research and Development Tax credit</b>aimed at small and micro firms, who will be able to claim a higher rate of credit of 30% and will have improved options with regards to claiming the payable credit. These firms will also be able to claim the credit for expenditure incurred in advance of commencing to trade.</p><p>Finally, in addition, as part of the &euro;28 million Border Enterprise Development Fund which I announced on the 3rd January last, I have provided an additional &euro;3 million for the six Local Enterprise Offices in the border Counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim for capability development programmes for micro and small firms with ambition.  This will enable them to pilot a series of mentoring programmes for businesses focused on boosting exports, embracing innovation and improving management and financial skills capability.</p></reply>

The IDA also owns additional sites across County Louth with almost 3 hectares of marketable land in the IDA Business and Technology Park at Finnabair, Dundalk and approximately 30 hectares of marketable land at the IDA strategic site in the Dundalk Science and Technology Park at Mullagharlin. In addition, the Agency continues to engage with local stakeholders in Drogheda and maintains an updated inventory of private sector greenfield sites zoned for development, available office accommodation and flexible working spaces.  </p>  <p>  This combination of private sector property offerings, along with the IDA&rsquo;s land holdings, places Drogheda and County Louth in a competitive position to compete for mobile foreign direct investment (FDI). The Agency continues to draw the attention of existing and prospective investors to the County through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. The IDA will also continue to actively monitor and review the commercial property offering in Drogheda.</p>  <p>  More broadly, County Louth continues to maintain a strong base of FDI with 29 IDA client companies in the County employing 4,428 people. In 2019, Louth witnessed a 12% increase in employment in overseas companies with 486 net new jobs added last year. While progress has been made in helping to generating new investment in County Louth, the Government remains determined to attract more FDI there.</p></reply>

In addition, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has published a guidance note for employers and employees in relation to COVID-19 on its website. </p>  <p>  The agencies under the remit of my Department have also been taking a proactive approach to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to support SMEs in the event of an outbreak here. Over the past number of weeks, Enterprise Ireland (EI) has undertaken internal work to determine how companies may be impacted, the potential scale of the impact on companies, and the responses that may be required to support companies.  </p>  <p>  This has involved engaging directly with clients to gather information on potential impact, and has also included providing information and advice to clients through the EI website.  Comprehensive client guidance is currently being developed to provide EI staff with information to enable them to respond and communicate effectively with clients. A steering group has been established in EI to manage its response to COVID-19, with the work of the group covering both client need identification and engagement and internal business continuity planning.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Centre of Excellence has circulated Department of Health public notices to their 31 LEOs located in the Local Authorities. Furthermore, the public notices and checklist for business continuity planning have been distributed to LEO clients. </p>  <p>  As a result of the onset of COVID-19, it is possible that a number of businesses could experience working capital pressure due to supply chain and other impacts. There are several financing supports available that may be appropriate to provide liquidity support to impacted businesses:</p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme provides a State guarantee to accredited lenders (Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland) of 80% on eligible loans or Performance Bonds to viable micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.  Facilities from &euro;10,000 up to &euro;1,000,000 are offered.  To access the Scheme, businesses can approach one of the participating providers.  The Scheme is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI);</p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme is administered by Microfinance Ireland with the purpose of providing unsecured loans of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;25,000 for terms of up to five years to microenterprises employing fewer than 10 people, with viable business propositions that cannot obtain funding through traditional sources. The scheme can be accessed through the Local Enterprise Office Network, through the Irish Local Development Network, or by applying directly using the Microfinance Ireland portal;</p>  <p>  - While the SBCI Brexit Loan Scheme supports working capital needs for businesses impacted by Brexit-related issues, it is possible that some businesses may be impacted by both Brexit and COVID-19 related working capital issues. Therefore, it may be a suitable support for some affected businesses.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department participate in various co-ordination groups relevant to managing Ireland&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, such as the Health Threats Co-Ordination Group, the Department of Health Communications Group and a Senior Officials Group convened by Department of An Taoiseach, and are kept up to date with all developments and can also raise issues that are relevant to our Department and Offices. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor evolving developments and will engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Health and other Government bodies in relation to further precautionary measures.</p></reply>

This will include the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock where relevant. In the first instance, only those small businesses and bodies which could not secure flood damage insurance are eligible. Furthermore, the scheme will not provide a contribution to loss of earnings or loss of business goodwill.</p><p>The scheme contains two stages as follows:  </p><p>1.The first stage will commence immediately and will provide a contribution of up to &euro;5,000, depending on the scale of damage incurred. It is anticipated that this will meet the needs for the majority of those affected. The intention is to process payments as fast as possible. </p><p>2.In the event that the premises have incurred significant damages above &euro;5,000, the second stage will provide a means to seek further support. However, this will be a lengthier process requiring a detailed assessment by the Irish Red Cross.  The total level of support available for both stages combined will be capped at &euro;20,000.</p><p>Further information on the Scheme including eligibility criteria and application forms for support are available on the Irish Red Cross website by accessing the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment-driven employment gains. There are now over 138,000 people employed across 724 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, which represents 57% of all IDA client-supported jobs.  </p><p>I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2020 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions.</p><p>When it comes to foreign direct investment, FDI, site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas.

I secured for my Department an additional &euro;15m Current and &euro;63 million capital funding in Budget 2019 and a further &euro;9 million in current funding and &euro;12 million in capital funding in Budget 2020. These resources have allowed me to increase allocations across the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), Enterprise Ireland (EI), and InterTradeIreland (ITI) to establish and continue to fund Brexit-related schemes and provide services. Furthermore, &euro;6.4 million of the increase to my Department&rsquo;s current budget in 2020 will allow for additional resources to be provided to the Department&rsquo;s regulatory bodies and its enterprise agencies to continue to prepare for a post-Brexit environment, in whatever form it may take, by expanding and further developing the suite of available supports.</p><p>My Department's funding allocation to the LEOs has been increased from &euro;33 million in 2018 to &euro;38.2 million in 2020. This increase is being used to support micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The LEOs are active across all counties and are working with enterprises across a broad range of sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit and have plans in place to manage new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. To date, there have been 7,040 participants at LEO Brexit Information Events and 1,381 mentoring participants focused solely on Brexit. There have also been 1,720 participants in the customs training programme that the LEOs have rolled out for all businesses, exporters and importers, in conjunction with EI. </p><p>My Department's funding allocation to EI has been increased from &euro;273 million in 2018 to &euro;282 million in 2020. Whilst these increases are not focused solely on Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by the UK's withdrawal from the EU. For example, I was pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75 million to EI in 2019 to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, which includes Brexit.  </p><p>Funding to EI also supports the organisation in the provision of Brexit-specific supports such as: the running of Brexit Advisory Clinics, at which there has been over 1,200 attendees to date; the EI Brexit Act On Programme, which is a support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise a report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience, and 359 Act On Plans have been completed to date; and the Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant, to which there has been 250 applications made to date to access financial support through the scheme.</p><p>The funding allocation to InterTradeIreland by my Department increased by &euro;1 million in 2019 and by a further &euro;1m in 2020 to enable the organisation to engage with more of the companies seeking its support through the Brexit Advisory Service. 5,416 SMEs directly engaged with the ITI Brexit Advisory Service in 2019 and this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018. </p><p>ITI also supports businesses through Brexit Planning Vouchers, worth up to &euro;2,250. These vouchers enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the EU and on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  To date 1,837 of such vouchers have been approved. Furthermore, in March 2019, ITI launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. To date 44 such vouchers have been approved.</p><p>To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I also introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by EI. The Scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two Calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 per cent match fund basis. This scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. The Pilot Online Retail Scheme concluded in 2019 and my Department and EI will review its effectiveness.  </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched at the end of March 2018, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million &ndash; &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. To date 889 applications have been approved for eligibility and 236 loans have been progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;49.57 million. To date there have been 173 repeat eligibility applications. </p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the SBCI in April of 2019. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, and using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300 million to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.

The fund forms a key part of the delivery of the pillar 1 goal of Future Jobs Ireland to embrace innovation and technological change. Funding is available for collaborative projects seeking investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges.</p><p>In February 2018, the Government committed an initial tranche of &euro;180 million (of the total &euro;500 million) to the DTIF, with funding to be allocated each year from 2019 to 2022, as follows:   <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>DTIF</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;20m* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;30m* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>&euro;40m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>&euro;90m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Some funds will carry over from 2019 to 2020 based on sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The DTIF was launched in 2018 and under the first call, my Department received over 300 applications. Following a competitive selection process involving international experts, 27 successful projects were approved for funding in December 2018.  The second call in 2019 resulted in a further 16 projects approved for funding. All of these projects are collaborative with multiple partners including SMEs, large companies, multinationals and research performing organisations (RPOs) such as our colleges and universities. In total, 159 organisations are involved in these collaborative projects.</p><p>As each project funded is a multi-year project of up to three years, the capital allocated to projects to date is reflective of this. A total of &euro;140 million has been allocated to 43 projects under the first two calls (27 projects with a commitment of &euro;75 million under call 1 and 16 projects with a commitment of &euro;65 million under call 2).</p><p>As of end February 2020, Enterprise Ireland, who administer the Fund on my behalf, had issued payments of just over &euro;15.4 million to project partners. A number of additional payments are in train, awaiting documentation from project partners before the funds can be released. Payments relating to both call 1 and call 2 projects will continue to issue throughout 2020 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

To date, there have been 7,040 participants at LEO Brexit Information Events and 1,381 mentoring participants focused solely on Brexit. There have also been 1,720 participants in the customs training programme that the LEOs have rolled out for all businesses, exporters and importers, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) is also providing Brexit-specific supports such as: the running of Brexit advisory clinics, at which there has been over 1,200 attendees to date; the EI Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; which is a support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise a report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience, and 359 &quot;Act on&quot; Plans have been completed to date; and the Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant, to which there has been 250 applications made to date to access financial support through the scheme.</p><p>InterTradeIreland (ITI) has a focus on cross border trade in Ireland and provides a number of Brexit supports, including a Brexit advisory service. 5,416 SMEs directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019 and this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018. </p><p>ITI also supports businesses through Brexit planning vouchers, worth up to &euro;2,250. These vouchers enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  To date 1,837 of such vouchers have been approved. Furthermore, in March 2019, ITI launched a Brexit implementation voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. To date 44 such vouchers have been approved.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched at the end of March 2018, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million &ndash; &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. To date 889 applications have been approved for eligibility and 236 loans have been progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;49.57 million. To date there have been 173 repeat eligibility applications. </p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in April of 2019. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, and using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, it leverages up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates.

Where a Department of state body fails to comply with these regulations, they must automatically pay compensation and late payment interest to suppliers. </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of each Government Department and state body to ensure its internal systems and processes are in order to meet obligations under the above Regulations.  I can confirm that my Department and its agencies have systems and processes in place to ensure that obligations under the 15-day prompt payment rules and the 30-day limit under the Regulations are met. Prompt payments is an integral part of the processes in this Department and its agencies and is constantly monitored. </p>  <p>  All Departments must publish, on a quarterly basis their compliance figures. All Departments must also publish the compliance levels of the bodies under their aegis on their respective websites.  In 2018 and 2019 respectively, 98% and 98% of all invoices received by Government Departments were paid within 30 days and did not incur late payment interest or compensation. In 2018 and 2019, 99% and 98% of all invoices received by the agencies of this Department were paid within 30 days and therefore did not incur late payment interest or compensation payments. </p>  <p>  In addition, 84% an 83% of invoices received by Government Departments were paid within 15-days and 92% and 89% of invoices received by the agencies of this Department were paid within 15-days.</p>  <p>  The compliance level among Government Departments and the agencies of my Department with the regulations have been consistently very strong which demonstrates that robust systems are in place to ensure compliance with the regulations.</p></reply>

Failure to do so incurs late payment interest. </p>  <p>  Compliance levels of Government Departments and public bodies with the Regulation are excellent.  In the latest reporting period, Q4 of 2019, 98% of invoices received by Departments were paid within 30 days.  For the state bodies under the aegis of my Department, 99% of invoices were paid within 30 days.  Individual Departments are responsible for reporting on the compliance levels of bodies under their aegis.</p>  <p>  In line with its commitment to address the issue of late payments the Irish Government has gone a step further than the strict requirement of the Regulation by requiring public authorities to pay for goods and services within 15 days.  Compliance with the 15-day requirement has also been strong among Government Departments with 83% paying within 15 days (in the latest reporting period) and 92% of invoices received by agencies under the remit of my Department paying within 15 days. </p>  <p>  To further encourage compliance, each Department is required to compile and publish their own quarterly payment performance reports as well as those of the bodies under their remit on their websites.</p>  <p>  In addition, in 2017 a commitment was made that public sector bodies would pay late payment interest and compensation costs (minimum of &euro;40) automatically after 30 days without an obligation on the provider to request such a payment. </p>  <p>  The various measures undertaken by my Department and across Government to ensure the terms of the Regulation have been observed have gone beyond mere transposition of the Directive and are proving very successful as is evident from the high level of compliance reported.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time.  However, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is proposed that the LTI Scheme would be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, complemented by the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are currently separate regional management structures in place within the HSE for hospital and community services - 6 Hospital Groups and 9 Community Healthcare Organisations. These structures are not aligned geographically and result in separate management and resourcing of acute and community services. This is a clear impediment to moving towards population based planning and integrated care as called for under Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>Under Sl&aacute;intecare proposals, Hospital Groups and CHOs will be replaced with regional bodies which will be responsible for the full spectrum of health and social care services in their region. This will allow care to be planned and delivered at a more local level, based on the needs of local populations.</p><p>In July 2019, the Government approved and announced the six geographical areas which proposed regional bodies will serve. The details of these geographical areas are available on the Department's website. Additionally, the Government approved the development by the Department of a detailed policy proposal for the reconfiguration of the HSE supported by a business case, for further consideration by<b></b>Government in 2020.</p><p>The detailed proposal will set out the high level organisational design for the system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional bodies; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct for the health service. This will provide the framework for system<b></b>change and guide development of legislative proposals and detailed operational planning.</p><p>The development of the detailed policy proposals and business case will involve significant engagement with key stakeholders across the health and social care sector, including current CHO and HG management structures, to ensure that any structural changes do not unduly cause disruption and loss of focus on service delivery and the roll-out of the broader reform programme.  I would also like to reassure you that the new policy proposals will not have any immediate impact on services.  Hospital Groups and CHOs currently provide important oversight of services and it is vital that they continue in this role to maintain the provision of safe services across our health and social care services while the design process for the new regions progresses.</p><p>This will include continuing to implement service improvements at both Group level and hospital level, as well as important strategies such as, for example, the Cancer and Maternity strategies.</p></reply>

The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to. All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities. </p>  <p>  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events relating to vaccination. Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and/or swelling at the point of injection and fever. Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. Mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination are not unusual. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product. Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks. The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.</p>  <p>  I would also like to reassure any persons who are suffering ill health that they are eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. </p>  <p>  I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website: hpv.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-03-05a.1539.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020030500076#WRBB02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 and 537 together.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019, the HSE approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has received an application for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. In October 2018, the NCPE recommended that ocrelizumab not be reimbursed for this indication.  The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission. On 10 February 2020, the NCPE sent a preliminary review to the applicant and are currently awaiting their response.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has received an application for reimbursement of siponimod (Mayzent) as indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity. On 13 January 2020, the NCPE completed a rapid review and recommended a full HTA with respect to this indication.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.</p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that, as Minister for Health, I met with Multiple Sclerosis Ireland in October 2018 in order to discuss new potential medicines for treatment of MS in the public healthcare system.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  There are three main steps to the application process:</p>  <p>- Step 1 is an application for a Care Needs Assessment. The Care Needs Assessment identifies whether or not the person needs long-term nursing home care. This is a key criteria and the HSE cannot make a determination on an application for State support under the Scheme unless a determination has been made that the person needs the relevant care services.</p>  <p>- Step 2 is an application for State Support. This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his/her corresponding level of financial assistance. The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care.</p>  <p>- Step 3 is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  Where a participant has assets that are included in the financial assessment, such as a principle private residence, the HSE will seek to establish the estimated market value of this asset. This can be done through valuation provided or through authorising a suitable person to carry out a valuation. The HSE is not bound by any valuation accompanying an application for State support.</p>  <p>  Applicants to the Scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's particular need. The HSE's Nursing Homes Support Offices can advise an applicant on the options available to them.</p></reply>

An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. On 17 October 2016 the Minister for Health established a multidisciplinary working group to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS), in relation to the code of practice under section 91(2) of the Act. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 [S.I. No. 527 of 2018]. This enabled the Director of the DSS to progress the preparation of the code of practice on the AHD provisions, based on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, and in accordance with the specific process outlined in the Act. The multidisciplinary working group submitted its recommendations on the code of practice to the Director of the DSS on 21 December 2018.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the commencement of Part 8 of the Act, my Department is fully committed to commencing these provisions as soon as possible. The development of the code of practice to accompany the AHR provisions is a key piece of work in facilitating commencement. The AHD Multidisciplinary Working Group developed a code of practice for Part 8 of the Act and submitted it to the Director of the Decision Support Service in December 2018 for consideration. When the Director finalises the Code of Practice it will be submitted to the Minister for approval before publication.</p></reply>

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research.  The General Scheme also provides for an independent regulatory authority for AHR.  The provisions outlined within the General Scheme will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the query as to whether a report will be provided on this issue, I wish to state that the focus of officials in my Department at this juncture is on ensuring that the legislation is published as soon as possible and thereafter assisting its progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access AHR treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. </p>  <p>  Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

HPV vaccine is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products around. The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.

In recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. </p>  <p>  As a result, since 2018 there have been continued improvements in paediatric scoliosis services, with increased activity and a reduction in waiting times to access appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p></reply>

These plans have developed from Ireland&rsquo;s response to similar incidents such as pandemic influenza, SARS and MERS in the past. </p>  <p>  Prior to the declaration by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020 that the outbreak of Coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in accordance with the provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005), Ireland has been monitoring the situation since it originally arose in December, 2019. We have been preparing for the potential consequences since then.  </p>  <p>  To the greatest extent possible, in matters relating to emerging international public health incidents, Ireland follows the advice and guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and continues to do so as the situation evolves.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is the forum for managing the interface between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency. The NPHET is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer and held its first meeting in relation to Covid-19 on Monday 27 January and has continued to meet regularly since then.</p>  <p>  In addition, an Expert Advisory Group provides scientific advice and assistance to the NPHET in carrying out its work.</p>  <p>  We are very conscious of the impacts on other sectors outside of health. Issues such as port health, travel advice, contingency planning, communications as well as advice and guidance to various sectors, including the public, are being kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  The Government has also agreed to establish a Cabinet Committee (chaired by the Taoiseach), to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of COVID-19. The work of the Cabinet Committee will include advice on downstream impacts, mitigations and contingencies for cross-sectoral issues and builds on the effective public health work undertaken to date. The cross-government approach to the coronavirus response will be based around cohesive decision-making, partnership, expert public health advice and clarity of communications.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health signed the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 53 of 2020) on Thursday 20th February 2020. These Regulations made provision for Covid-19 to be added to the list of notifiable diseases so that doctors will be obliged to notify the HSE when a case is suspected or diagnosed. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is closely monitoring the emerging situation and is collaborating with the Department, other Departments and various agencies in relation to preparedness measures. </p>  <p>  We have six cases in Ireland and three in Northern Ireland. The six cases in Ireland include two in the East and four in the West. All cases were identified and tested in line with established protocols for the investigation of suspect cases of Covid-19 and all are associated with travel from an affected area in Northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case. The HSE is working to identify contacts the patients may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread. None of the patients have been named publicly by the Department of Health or the HSE in order to protect patient confidentiality. We have also been working closely with the public health authorities in Northern Ireland and public health authorities have activated all appropriate contact tracing protocols. </p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team, at its meeting on 3 March 2020, has recommended the following:</p>  <p>  - Ireland&rsquo;s case definition remains the same. It will continue to be reviewed by the National Public Health Emergency Team as the global situation evolves;</p>  <p>  - On public health grounds, the travel advice for Italy is updated to advise against all non-essential travel to the following four regions: Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont;</p>  <p>  - Mass Gatherings Guidelines to be published in the coming days, following cross Government review;</p>  <p>  - The HSE now moves to a community testing model for assessment and investigation of suspect cases;</p>  <p>  - Four sub-groups have been established to review arrangements for vulnerable people, Health &amp;amp; Social Care Workers Protection, Acute Hospital Preparedness, Continuity of supply of Medicines and Medical Devices.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains in containment phase, where the focus is on identifying and isolating any possible cases and ensuring rigorous infection prevention and control and contact tracing procedures are in place. </p>  <p>  Due to circumstances constantly evolving the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET will continue to communicate key public health messages to the public to keep them informed and up to date in relation to all matters concerning Covid-19. All relevant information will continue to be published on the websites of the HSE, the HPSC and Gov.ie.</p></reply>

As a result, private outpatient clinics may be held on public hospital campuses but these clinics must be held outside contracted hours.  Private clinics are currently located on the grounds of each the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The new children's hospital is obliged to provide such facilities for consultants holding such contracts.  Accordingly, while the vast majority of services in the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be public services, within the new hospital an area has been planned which carries the designation of "private clinic".  The private outpatient clinic at the new children&rsquo;s hospital represents circa 0.25% of the clinical space within the new children&rsquo;s hospital. There are a total of 129 outpatient clinical exam rooms primarily accessed off the main concourse on the ground and lower ground floor of the new children&rsquo;s hospital, each of which are identical in design and fit out. There are 8 clinical exam rooms in the private outpatient clinic.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proposal is for consultants to pay a fee for use of private rooms and other operational costs. The proposed level of fee has not been determined yet.</p></reply>

There is no stroke unit in OLHN nor does the hospital have a consultant specialist in stroke.  The Mater Hospital, who will accept the majority of these patients, will provide stroke care to patients from the Navan catchment area.  </p><p>Under the stroke bypass protocol, it will be possible to ensure that patients from Meath return to OLHN, closer to their families, as soon as possible.  Once assessed at the stroke unit in the Mater, the patients who do not require thrombolysis will return to Navan to complete their care.  Those patients who do require thrombolysis treatment will be repatriated to Navan within a 48/72-hour period to complete their care. </p><p>Navan will continue to provide rehabilitation care for stroke patients in the catchment area.<b></b>This new protocol will improve patient safety and outcomes for the people of Meath who have a stroke. </p></reply>

The Framework identified the activities that can be performed in smaller Model 2 hospitals, like Roscommon Hospital, in a safe and sustainable manner. In developing our smaller hospitals, the first and over-riding concern is the safety of patients. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in the establishment and development of Hospital Groups over the last few years.  Our hospitals are now working together and supporting each other in Groups.  This new way of working provides a stronger role for smaller hospitals, like Roscommon Hospital, in delivering a higher volume of less complex care in many cases closer to patients&rsquo; homes.  It also ensures that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in a larger hospital environment.</p>  <p>  Through reconfiguration and consolidation of services, demonstrably better outcomes can be achieved for patients, as has already been shown in the case of cancer treatment.</p>  <p>  Minor Injuries Clinics and similar units provide valuable services to local communities and alleviate the pressures on Emergency Departments.  The Roscommon Injuries Unit is located in the urgent care centre in Roscommon Hospital,  is open 7 days a week from 8am to 8pm, and can treat both adults and children aged 5 and over with non-life-threatening or limb-threatening injuries.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the recorded number of patients attending the Roscommon Injuries Unit have continued to rise, from approximately 5,000 in 2016, to 6,100 in 2017, up to 6,600 in 2018.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to reopen the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon Hospital at this time.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018, I approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across all hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists. </p><p>The NCVU advises that in 2019, they completed 269 validation cycles, across 37 hospitals, resulting in 7,651 patients being removed from the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list and 45,270 from the Outpatient waiting lists.</p><p>In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the NCVU provided the attached document which outlines outpatient validation figures by hospital.</p><p>  ">OPD Validation Removals</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year. In 2019, the number of patients over the age of 75 attending hospital EDs increased by 5% compared to 2018. For the month of December 2019, the number of patients over the age of 75 attending hospital EDs was 15,409 which represents a 12.4% increase from the same month in 2018. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group.</p>  <p>  The National Service Plan 2019 included an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department be discharged or admitted within 24 hours and any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  There are a number of factors which may affect the waiting times for older patients. In particular, people in the older age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and be admitted then the population generally. Consequently, a higher number of these patients may have to be cared for on trolleys, pending their admission to a ward. There are also issues around delayed discharges of care which can cause congestion within hospital emergency departments.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for data collection and data management expertise.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the documents attached, which set out waiting list data for Quarter 4 2019 for CT, MRI and Ultrasound. The HSE advises that, at present, the further diagnostic scans requested by the Deputy (including cholangiopancreatography, electroencephalogram, angiogram, and bone scan), are not yet captured as part of this project. </p><p>The information that is currently being collected is presently being tested and validated at hospital, hospital group and national level and as such should not be used/reported without the context of the caveats set out below:</p><p>- Data is subject to inclusions and exclusions which are documented in the Data Profile Document. This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.</p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.</p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.</p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).</p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number ofpatients waiting for modalities of CT, MR and Ultrasound.</p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnosticswaiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.</p><p>In Q4 there were a total of 184,293 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals).</p><p>  ">MRI Scan</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019. 217 training places are available for 2020, and the number of doctors applying to the training scheme commencing in 2020 is the highest on record at 461. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors, to the benefit of doctors and patients across the country.</p>  <p>  Regarding the number of GPs providing care to medical card and GP visit card holders, the number of GPs contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme has risen from 2,098 in 2008 to 2,509 at the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the details of general practice services available in Kells, as this is an operational issue I have asked the HSE to reply to the directly to the Deputy in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting lists - local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the NTPF is unable to identify whether patients on the Diagnostics waiting list are over or under 18 years of age.</p></reply>

There is a strong overlap between the day supports now provided as part of the New Directions approach and the programmes being offered by Rehabilitative Training. </p>  <p>  The clear policy rationale of not making the Rehabilitative Training bonus payment to new entrants is to ensure access to high quality services to those who need them, on an equitable basis.  Since September 2019, new entrants no longer receive the bonus payment, in line with those attending similar training programmes. </p>  <p>  Individuals already in receipt of the bonus payment  will continue to receive it for the duration of their course. The savings made are ring fenced to facilitate  provision of additional full and part time day placements nationally, based on priority need. </p>  <p>The HSE has advised the Department that in the period from September to 31st  December 2019, 22 additional full-time placements and 19 additional part time placements were funded by the redirected monies. Each of these places has enhanced the lives of people, and their families.  Enhanced service hours are enabling service users to be part of their local communities and enjoy greater choices about how they spend their time, while providing valuable social opportunities for families. In addition, adults who were heretofore not in receipt of any service are now engaging with their communities and experiencing new opportunities, having previously been socially isolated.</p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the allowance would be c. &euro;4m over 4 years, and in addition to this an alternative funding stream would be required for the day service placements already funded, and for those identified for a place in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to confirm the exact figure saved since September 2019, and to contact the Deputy directly in this regard.</p></reply>

It must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p>  <p>  The OPAP prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 and a progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the OPIOG.</p>  <p>  On establishment the OPIOG identified key early areas for action and established two sub-groups:</p>  <p>  - The sub-group on Healthy Eating has as a priority output the development of Healthy Eating Guidelines for 1-5 year olds.  This work is well advanced and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020.</p>  <p>  - The sub-group on Reformulation has as its priority the setting of targets for food and drink reformulation and a &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; for reformulation action to achieve those targets.  The submission of a report with the targets and roadmap is expected in the first half of 2020.</p>  <p>  Achievements under the policy to date include:</p>  <p>  - The Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May 2018.  The tax is charged at a rate of &euro;16.26 per hectolitre for drinks with a sugar content of between 5 and 8 grams per 100ml and &euro;24.39 per hectolitre for drinks with in excess of 8 grams per 100ml.</p>  <p>  - A National Clinical Lead for Obesity was appointed in the HSE in 2017, with a focus on developing a clinical programme and model of care for treatment and management of obesity for children and adults, as well as on prevention by building into the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, through the Making Every Contact Count brief intervention programme and chronic disease management.</p>  <p>  - A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme is in place. The programme supports work in the education sector and works with parents, families and communities in delivering a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity.  </p>  <p>  - The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years provides for &ldquo;health and wellness&rdquo; checks at ages 2 and 5 which include weight and height monitoring.</p>  <p>  - New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources were published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  - New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, were developed. Recently, additional standards for the meals provided under the hot school meals pilot have been developed and agreed.</p>  <p>  - A Code of Practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has been developed.

This will operate through a hub and spoke model, utilising the MDT approach, to provide equitable patient access&rsquo;. </p><p>In reality, this means that the establishment of multi-disciplinary psycho-oncology teams in each of the cancer centres is required. These teams will deliver a comprehensive hospital-based clinical service and will also provide a community support function into community cancer support groups. The strategy emphasises the prioritisation of Psycho-Oncology and survivorship programmes as a core part of cancer care. It also recognises the vital importance of community cancer support.</p><p>The NCCP has submitted an application for funding for psychosocial community support and cancer survivorship programmes as part of the National Service Plan for 2020. The outcome of this application is imminent and has been prioritised by the Department of Health in their correspondence with the HSE. We are hopeful that we will receive funding towards this very important service. To date applications for funding have been received from 28 community cancer support centres and groups. </p><p>The NCCP has had on-going communication with community cancer support centres and groups who are key stakeholders in our endeavours to provide a comprehensive integrated hospital and community psychosocial support service for patients and their families. The NCCP are currently devising a set of standards for community cancer support centres and groups and an association will be created. If funding is available all applications will be considered on a co-funding model prioritising core services; information, psychological support and counselling and survivorship programmes. </p></reply>

A network of 11 clinical nurse co-ordinators is in place, with responsibility for ensuring that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services. A second consultant took up a position at Temple Street Children's Hospital in February 2019. The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has agreed that both posts will be located in the new national children&rsquo;s hospital when it opens. These services are available to children across the country, includng the south-east. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient/daycase treatment and with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services. In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals this year. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure the accuracy of waiting lists, good practice around the management of hospital waiting lists recommends periodic validation of waiting lists. Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018, I approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across all hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Furthermore,  the National Scheduled Care Audit and Quality Assurance Review Programme was established in the NTPF in 2014 in conjunction with the National Director of Acute Hospitals, Health Service Executive. The main role of the AQA Team is to audit hospital waiting lists, ensuring that waiting list data returned by public hospitals is in compliance with national data reporting requirements and hospital practices are in compliance with national waiting list protocols and that the waiting list data returned by public hospitals is accurate. </p>  <p>  More broadly, my Department has placed a particular priority on performance improvement in scheduled and unscheduled care in order to improve access for patients. At the end of 2017, a Unit was established in my Department with a remit to work with Departmental colleagues, the HSE and NTPF to provide strategic direction and drive a joint approach to performance oversight and innovation in this area. The monitoring of waiting lists is a key activity of this Unit. This includes weekly analysis of waiting list figures provided by the NTPF and regular governance meetings with the HSE and the NTPF.</p></reply>

Mental health services, including those for young people, have benefited from significant additional investment over recent years. This has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;1.026 billion for HSE Mental Health services in 2020, reflecting an increase of &euro;315m since 2012 and an increase of &euro;39m over 2019.</p>  <p>  This additional funding has helped to increase the number of community-based CAMHS teams from 49 in 2008 to 71 today. The number of acute CAMHS beds has also increased, from 16 in 2008 to 74 in 2020. 30 additional beds are planned in the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital and at the new National Forensic Mental Health Service at Portrane. This will bring the total CAMHS beds nationally to 104. The new complex at Portrane is scheduled to open on a phased basis from September 2020, with the new forensic CAMHS Unit, the first of its kind nationally, due to come on-stream in 2021.</p>  <p>  There are acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, particularly Consultant Psychiatrists.  Intensive recruitment efforts are ongoing but there is currently a shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS Consultants both at national and European level.  Steady progress is being made by the HSE, however, in filling approved posts for mental health. </p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2019, demand for services increased substantially, with an increase of 24% in CAMHs referrals accepted. Despite this, the CAMHs waiting list increased by only 4% over this period. Reducing the CAMHS Waiting List is a priority for the HSE.  The CAMHS Waiting List nationally reduced from around 2,500 in December 2018 to around 2,300 in December 2019. This decrease has occurred, in part, due to new funding for 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists posts in Primary Care since 2018. </p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2020 prioritises further CAMHS improvements, including increased integration with Primary Care; developing a 7-day-a-week service to ensure improved supports; enhancing early intervention and day hospital care; improving in-patient and community based services; ensuring greater promotion and use of talk therapies; and developing Eating Disorder and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services. Mental Health service delivery to young people will also improve through the use of such e-mental health initiatives as the recently introduced phone helpline, a new text line, and digital supports including online counselling.</p>  <p>  Further improvements for the planning and delivery of mental health services to young people are being progressed in the context of the refresh of A Vision For Change which has been completed and will be launched in the near future, along with updating the Mental Health Act 2001 which is now well advanced.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

It is being delivered through participating finance providers nationally to make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p><p>The loans are competitively priced (an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000), are for terms of 8-10 years and support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. However, considering the needs of Irish farmers, I negotiated a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 for them.</p><p>This is a financial product that was previously unavailable in Ireland, hence the involvement of the various public bodies to bring it to market. The unique characteristic of the Scheme is that loans up to &euro;500,000 are unsecured, making it a viable source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It also serves smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p><p>Food companies have identified long-term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am happy that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor.</p><p>The Scheme has been open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since 17th April 2019.  At close of business on 28th February, 3,132 applications had been received, of which 3,001 are approved, 2 are ineligible and 129 are in progress.  A breakdown, including details of farmers and agri-food businesses, is in the table.  </p><p>Future Growth Loan Scheme at 28.02.2020 <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Applied </th>       <th>Approved</th>       <th>Sanctioned</th>       <th>Value of Sanctioned Loans </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No of Farmers</td>       <td>1,079</td>       <td>1,021</td>       <td>420</td>       <td>&euro;51.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Food Businesses </td>       <td>350</td>       <td>335</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>&euro;24.3m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>3,132</td>       <td>3,001</td>       <td>1,020</td>       <td>&euro;213.6m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Scheme has been popular among businesses and farmers and there has been very strong demand for this longer term, lower cost finance. This demand has resulted in a rapid take-up of the Scheme and consequently SBCI have advised that there is limited remaining capacity.</p></reply>

More forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020. </p>  <p>  - two new  ecologists are joining the Department ecology team shortly.  </p>  <p>  - We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files. Four local ecologists  have also been contracted in this week to provide extra support. This will be complemented by a tender to outsource ecological expertise, which has been published with a closing date of 13 March, 2020.</p>  <p>  - Additional administrative staff have  been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  </p>  <p>  - 3 planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p>  <p>  - A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.</p>  <p>  The first appeals on licences, which have been determined under the new Appropriate Assessment procedure (where appeals have been submitted) were fast-tracked with decisions received, the majority of which were in the Department&rsquo;s favour. </p>  <p>  On 7 February, Minister Eoghan Murphy and I signed orders and regulations making provision for the introduction of the single consent system.  This enables the Department to be the sole consenting authority for forest roads including an entrance from a public road, or material widening of an existing entrance.  Applications for forest road works licences, that include such an entrance have been accepted since 14 February.  I understand that applications are being progressed by forestry companies.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, let me assure you that our long-term commitment to forestry is unwavering and that every effort is being made to resolve current issues. I acknowledge that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that no political representations were made in relation to the correspondence. </p>  <p>  The decision not to proceed further with prosecution in this case was taken having regard to the full and individual circumstances of this case.  Department officials had worked closely with the family of the individual concerned during 2018 and 2019 to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the animal welfare and related issues on this farm, and this positive and constructive engagement led to progressive resolution of the issues.  The final resolution of all welfare and related issues was concluded to the full satisfaction of my Department in October 2019 and a further inspection in December 2019 confirmed the ongoing satisfactory situation on the farm.</p>  <p>  Having reviewed all aspects of the case in consultation with relevant divisions within my Department, including legal services and local office management, a decision was taken by senior management not to proceed with the prosecution in this case.  Animal welfare cases can be complex and difficult, with a range of human as well as animal factors to be considered, and I am grateful to all those who contributed to the successful resolution of this case.   </p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that Prosecutors are not legally compelled to pursue all prosecution cases to a final conclusion in the courts. Occasionally, there will be instances where the facts of a case are such that proceeding with a prosecution may not be considered desirable, appropriate or justifiable. Prosecution cases can be withdrawn for a variety of reasons. For example, decisions can be made to withdraw prosecutions based on legal advice, or as a result of a changes in circumstances or personnel of a business or the operator of a business, or because of a satisfactory resolution of the original issues that were the subject of the prosecution or, where appropriate, on humanitarian or compassionate grounds.    </p>  <p>  It is entirely a matter for the Department to decide when it is and when it is not appropriate to proceed with a prosecution against an individual.  My Department takes its prosecutorial functions very seriously and exercises prudent and careful judgement in deciding how best to manage prosecutions brought in the name of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

My Department has allocated funding to the Connemara Pony Breeders Society under the Equine Infrastructures Scheme since 2015 to facilitate this project.</p>  <p>  The results from this project will enable the Society to plan for the future and implement a strategy to manage this genetic defect identifying potential carriers.  This should decrease the incidence of the disease with a view to eliminating it for the Connemara pony population.</p>  <p>  The CPBS has informed me that it will be accepting HWSD results from recognised organisations other than Weatherby&rsquo;s Scientific in 2020.  They are currently finalising procedures to implement this system.  This was approved by the CPBS council in late 2019. The results will be recorded as a private test on the pony profile on the CPBS online database. Information, once available, will be posted on the CPBS website.</p></reply>

Occasionally, there will be instances where the facts of a case are such that proceeding with a prosecution may not be considered desirable, appropriate or justifiable. Prosecution cases can be withdrawn for a variety of reasons. For example, decisions can be made to withdraw prosecutions based on legal advice, or as a result of a changes in circumstances or personnel of a business or the operator of a business, or because of a satisfactory resolution of the original issues that were the subject of the prosecution or, where appropriate, on humanitarian or compassionate grounds. </p>  <p>  It is entirely a matter for the Department to decide when it is and when it is not appropriate to proceed with a prosecution against an individual.  My Department takes its prosecutorial functions very seriously and exercises prudent and careful judgement in deciding how best to manage prosecutions brought in the name of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

In December 2019, I announced the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m to 106 animal welfare organisations, a number of which undertake work with equines.</p><p>Regarding the urban horse issue, my Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas. As an example, in the context of breeding, the DSPCA with financial assistance from my Department, continues to facilitate castration clinics and education programs in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues. </p><p>Officials from my Department also sit on the Dublin Region Horse Welfare Working Group with local authorities and relevant NGOs.  </p><p>In 2018 and 2019, my Department also funded an equine welfare course aimed at horse owners, in particular those who have involvement with trotting/harness type animals. Four of these courses were run including one in Garristown, Co Dublin.  </p><p>Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, local authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The local authorities may also prosecute offenders.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect for investigation. If the Deputy wishes to pass on details of any cases of alleged neglect or cruelty that he is aware of, they will be fully investigated by my Department and appropriate actions, up to and including prosecution, may be taken. </p><p>The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline in place for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:  </p><p>Helpline Phone No: Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379.  </p><p>Email address -  animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Furthermore, my Department has published a tender to contract external ecological expertise.  The closing date for this tender is 13th March, 2020. My Department has already engaged environmental consultants, who continue to work on the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists are being deployed on contract this week, to provide extra support.</p>  <p>  The steps being taken are taking effect with the number of felling  licences issued in February showing a marked improvement on previous months, with a doubling of output in all three categories of felling, afforestation and roads. </p></reply>

Government is providing a cross-agency response to the issue, co-ordinated by the National Emergency Co-ordination Group, under the guidance of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are active participants in the work of the Group. I have also tasked my officials with monitoring the situation in parallel with their ongoing involvement with other Departments and State Agencies in the affected areas. In addition, I have asked Teagasc to monitor the situation on the ground and I understand that they have established support in locally affected areas (Shannon basin) through farm visits where necessary and the availability of advisors to support any farmers seeking information or guidance. </p>  <p>  While there has been significant levels of flooding on farmland, the majority of bovine animals are still currently housed. The potential for animal welfare to be compromised is a key concern. My Department is operating a helpline (Callsave number 0761 064408 or 01-6072379) to which affected farmers or anyone with a concern regarding the welfare of animals can report details.  My officials remain ready to respond to any such reports.</p>  <p>  Positive weather last year resulted in significant levels of fodder being saved throughout the country and there have been no reports to date of shortages or supply issues in the affected areas.  </p>  <p>  In terms of support to the agricultural sector, my Department has issued payments of just over &euro;1.7 billion in direct support payments to the farming community in respect of their activities for 2019.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I, my officials and those Agencies under my remit will continue to closely monitor the situation in the weeks ahead and will work with those most impacted by this extended wet period.</p></reply>

The timeline for negotiations is challenging, and it is likely that they will be demanding and difficult, as Brexit negotiations have been to date.</p><p>The Department is working within a whole-of-Government effort, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to ensure the best possible outcome for the agri-food and fisheries sectors. It is also in ongoing consultation with stakeholders to consolidate and improve our preparations.</p></reply>

A significant number of Working Group meetings have been held under the Austrian, Romanian and Finnish Presidencies, and work is continuing apace under the Croatian Presidency. The proposals have also been discussed extensively at the Special Committee for Agriculture and have been a standing agenda item at every Council of EU Agriculture Ministers meeting.</p>  <p>  While significant progress has been made, decisions on many key issues have still to be agreed. These include the proposed new green architecture, which is aimed at achieving a higher level of climate ambition, and the New Delivery Model, which is aimed at measuring Member States' performance in achieving the objectives of the CAP. Before the new proposals can be implemented, it will be necessary to reach overall agreement within the Council, and then with the European Parliament and Commission.  The new Parliament has yet to reach a position in plenary on the proposals. </p>  <p>  Under the MFF draft proposals, the European Commission has proposed that funding for the CAP should be set at &euro;365 billion, which equates to a cut of approximately 5%.  I have consistently stated that this is unacceptable for Ireland, and I have worked hard with my European counterparts, and with Commissioners Hogan and Wojciechowski, to build consensus around the need to maintain a strong CAP budget post-2020. </p>  <p>  There are divergent views among Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  Some, including Ireland, have indicated their willingness to increase their national contributions, once they contribute towards areas of added European value, while others feel equally strongly that the current proposals would be too costly. </p>  <p>  There is still some way to go before agreement can be achieved, but I can assure the Deputy that my Department and I will continue to ensure that protecting the CAP budget remains a key priority for Ireland in these negotiations.</p>  <p>  Agreement on the next MFF is a matter for Heads of State and Government, and requires unanimity by all Member States at the European Council.  The proposed budget must also be agreed by the European Parliament. </p></reply>

The scheme was closed for new applications in July 2019 in line with the published Application Guidelines. Successful projects that were not completed in 2019 will be funded this year.</p><p>A range of other grants for energy efficiency upgrades continue to be available from the SEAI. The Budget 2020 allocation of &euro;146 million (capital and current) is the highest ever budget for these schemes. More information is available from . A record level of funding (&euro;45 million) for retrofitting social housing is also being made available to Local Authorities by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This investment is an important step towards realising the Government's Climate Action Plan targets. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing and redesigning the existing grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government climate objectives and value for money. The Plan also sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.</p><p>To deliver our Climate Action Plan target, a Retrofit Taskforce has been established which will develop a new retrofitting delivery model. Our plan will:</p><p>- Group homes in the same area together to drive down cost</p><p>- Start with social homes owned by the local authorities, but will embrace privately owned homes in the wider community</p><p>- Develop smart finance options (e.g. loan guarantee models)</p><p>- Introduce easy pay back models (e.g. through your utility bill)</p><p>Budget 2020 provided &euro;20 million to commence this process, starting with groups of social homes in the Midlands to be upgraded at the same time. Private homeowners will be encouraged to participate through the provision of SEAI grants. </p><p>The selection of the Midlands to start rolling out this plan is ideal because of the structural changes occurring there. </p></reply>

However, there are complex issues at play in this area, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question.</p>  <p>  Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. ​A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The priority of the Government, at this time, is to target supports where they can have the most effect in aiding Ireland's transition to a low carbon economy.</p>  <p>  With regards to the electric vehicle purchase grant the objective of the policy is to increase the number of electric vehicles on Ireland&rsquo;s roads as quickly and as efficiently as possible. As such, it is envisioned that the grant being provided for the vehicle, as opposed to just the battery, will increase initial purchases but also support the development of a second hand market for electric vehicles; an important consideration in terms of meeting demand but also in sustaining and continuing to promote electric vehicle prevalence in the Irish market. It is important in this regard for consumers to know that the market practices of buying and selling an electric vehicle are similar to those that are in place for vehicles which are non electric. </p>  <p>  In line with EU and international ambition, the Government will continue to promote this important technological shift for our transport sector and one of the key ways to do this is for consumers to see, in their everyday lives, as many electric vehicles as possible. </p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of large scale scrapping of electric vehicles early in the period of their useful life. While there are differences in electric vehicle life cycles I am confident that as Ireland and the EU continue to grow the market we will see electric vehicles have increasing useful life periods.</p>  <p>  Developing and increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road is a key priority for this government and in promoting this policy the Government is also committed to monitoring the electric vehicle market as it matures so as to continue to support those schemes which have the most impact in meeting our objectives. </p></reply>

The measures that have been put in place are significantly supporting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s charging network, both public and private. The network will increase very significantly in the years to come and this will alleviate access issues and ensure that everyone has good access to a well-developed and modern charging network. Already &euro;10 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged another &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: </p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers (150kW chargers), each capable of charging two vehicles </p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers (50kW charger), which may replace existing 22 kW chargers </p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW chargers) to more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points.</p>  <p>  There are also commitments in the Climate Action Plan to develop more analysis and plan ahead accordingly for the period up to 2030 to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s electric vehicle charging infrastructure can keep pace with expected increases in demand. This work is already underway and will be supported by a number of Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The current policy has already identified that home charging should be the most cost-effective method of charging, followed by on-street public charging and then destination charging. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. Combined with a public charging network, Ireland&rsquo;s home charging network will help sustain and service the growth in electric vehicle numbers. Many elements of charging are already being supported by the Government, from generous grants for families and their homes to supports for local authorities and public chargers.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s interventions are also spurring private investment and I expect over the coming years that Irish and international companies will very significantly expand their charging networks nationwide.</p></reply>

The Plan also sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.</p><p>To deliver our Climate Action Plan target of 500,000 housing upgrades by 2030, we will develop a new retrofitting delivery model. Our plan will:</p><p>- Group homes in the same area together to drive down cost</p><p>- Start with social homes owned by the local authorities, but will embrace privately owned homes in the wider community</p><p>- Develop smart finance options (e.g. loan guarantee models)</p><p>- Introduce easy pay back models (e.g. through your utility bill)</p><p>Budget 2020 provided &euro;20 million to commence this process, starting with groups of social homes in the Midlands to be upgraded at the same time. Private homeowners will be encouraged to participate through the provision of SEAI grants. The selection of the Midlands to start rolling out this plan is ideal because of the structural changes occurring there. </p><p>A cross-Departmental Taskforce that will drive the achievement of the Climate Action Plan target has been established. Development of the new model is being informed by the experience from existing schemes in Ireland including the Warmth and Wellbeing and Deep Retrofit Pilot schemes as well as best practice in other jurisdictions and extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement.</p><p>Government currently funds a number of grants and support schemes that are helping homeowners and businesses to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. The budget for these schemes in 2020 is &euro;146 million (capital and current), which is a record level of funding.</p><p>The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides fixed grants covering approximately 30% of the cost of works being carried out by a homeowner. Grants are provided for a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heat pumps, heating controls, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER). Grants range from &euro;300 for attic insulation up to &euro;6,000 for external insulation of a detached home. Full details of the amounts available towards each measure are available on SEAI&rsquo;s website: . In 2019, 18,531 homes received energy efficiency grants through this scheme with an average grant amount per home of &euro;1,238.</p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme is aiming to objectively measure and validate the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the living conditions of vulnerable people living in energy poverty with chronic respiratory conditions. Since 2016 1,244 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed. According to SEAI, the average cost per home completed to date is &euro;22,800. An independent analysis is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.</p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme was launched in 2017 as a time bound pilot to investigate the challenges and opportunities of deep retrofit in Ireland. The scheme closed for applications in July 2019. To date 325 homes have all been upgraded to an A3 Building Energy Rating. According to SEAI, the average capital cost of works per home completed to date is &euro;54,047. Government funding of 50% of the cost (including project management and consultancy costs) was made available (with uplift to 95% of the cost for those at risk of energy poverty). The average grant paid was therefore &euro;31,778 per home completed. Initial findings from the pilot are available on SEAI's website: <i></i></p></reply>

The enterprise sector will play a pivotal role in our ability to meet these targets. The Climate Action Plan establishes ambitious targets for the enterprise sector and commits to a range of actions which will reduce the sector&rsquo;s emissions.</p><p>A strong carbon price will drive decarbonisation, with the EU Emissions Trading System providing this for the majority of the enterprise sector&rsquo;s emissions (c. 68%), with carbon tax providing a price signal for the sector's non-ETS emissions. </p><p>Actions and measures in the Climate Action Plan which develop our energy system will directly impact the decarbonisation of our enterprise sector, including the target for 70% renewable electricity by 2030. These actions will also present new areas of opportunity for industry, such as the development of offshore renewables and introduction of new technologies. The plan includes a set of actions to ensure our enterprise agencies prioritise decarbonisation as part of their strategies. It includes actions to ensure the agencies play a key role in the development of sectoral networks in key industry sectors needed to drive the decarbonisation of our society and economy. </p><p>A key role is identified in the Climate Action Plan for my Department, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s support to drive decarbonisation through measures to enable businesses reduce their energy use and emissions. Measures currently in place include: </p><p>- The Excellence in Energy Efficient Design programme; </p><p>- The SME Programme; </p><p>- The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat; </p><p>- A range of supports to companies in the Large Industry Energy Network; </p><p>- The Community Grant Scheme. </p><p>The Climate Action Fund will support initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland's climate and energy targets and a call for expressions of interest from the fund was made on 31 December 2019.</p></reply>

A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases.   </p>  <p>  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop providing dedicated funding to local authorities in respect of LIS (2011 was the last year dedicated funding was provided by this Department).  From 2013 to 2017 local authorities could use a proportion of this Department's Discretionary Grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  The reason this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme for non-public roads.</p>  <p>  Section 81 of the 2001 Local Government Act also provides that another Minister may make a grant to a road authority in relation to non-public roads in accordance with a Scheme made by that other Minister.  In September 2017 the Minister for Rural and Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for LIS.  In light of this and the pressing need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of the Discretionary Grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018.</p>  <p>  Currently my Department has no plans to make any amendments to Section 81 of the Local Government Act 2001.  The Deputy should note that section 81 enables me to fund works related to non-public roads, from the funding I grant to road authorities for road works generally.  In so far as the question concerns maintenance of drainage in other circumstances, this is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and I, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, have no function in the matter.</p></reply>

The safe operation of drones in Ireland is currently regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority Small Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) and Rockets Order 2015, S.I. 563 of 2015.  The 2015 Order prohibits operating of a drone in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life or cause damage to the property of others.  In addition the IAA has published guidance material to encourage safe and responsible drone operation.</p>  <p>  In light of new EU drone Regulations, the IAA is currently reviewing S.I. 563 of 2015. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 were published to ensure harmonised, safe and secure drone production and use across Europe.  These Regulations cover essential requirements to mitigate risks pertaining to the safety of the flight, privacy, and protection of personal data, security or the environment, arising from the operation of drones.</p></reply>

This discretion does not extend, however, to allowing all cyclists free rein to mount and dismount footpaths as they please.  As the Deputy may recall, my predecessor as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Paschal Donohoe T.D., introduced fixed charge notices for a number of cycling offences, including that of cycling without reasonable consideration, in August 2015.  The offence of cycling without reasonable consideration was in fact worded in such a way that it would include those caught cycling on a footpath and my Department does not consider any further legislative provision necessary at this time.</p>  <p>  While I entirely agree with the Deputy's view that cycling on the footpath poses a threat to public safety, particularly when it comes to the very young, the elderly, and the disabled, I must stress that the enforcement of cycling regulations, as with all aspects of Road Traffic law, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I must further clarify that the use of electric scooters in public places is strictly prohibited in Ireland, irrespective of whether the vehicle is driven on a footpath, cycle track, bus lane or open road.</p></reply>

This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.   </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to liaise with Meath County Council in relation to the further analysis required to underpin the assessment and costing of various options for managing traffic in the Julianstown area and in this context the Department met with the Council this week.</p>  <p>  As also explained previously the project assessment process can be expected to take time and all proposed projects must now comply with the revised Public Spending Code published in December 2019.  </p>  <p>  Meath County Council has confirmed that it is committed to implementing traffic management measures in the vicinity of Julianstown in the shorter term.</p></reply>

Their goal is to make bus transport faster and more reliable, thereby encouraging more people to switch from private cars to public transport.  This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.</p>  <p>  In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic.  The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services.  Finally, after the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow taxis to use them.  This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire.</p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes.  These have included requests on behalf of motorcyclists, multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, hired limousines, hackneys, and animal ambulances, among others.  My predecessors and I have always rejected these requests.  Any addition to the categories of vehicle permitted to use the lanes would inevitably reduce their efficiency for performing their original purpose of prioritising bus-based public transport as well as making them less safe and available for cyclists.</p></reply>

I note that the Navan Corridor Study refers to 2011 as being the base year for the purposes of establishing travel demand with 2035 the forecast year. </p><p>While the Strategy stated that based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre was insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link at that current time, it proposed an enhanced bus service along the corridor and the development of a bus hub in Navan.  Importantly, the Transport Strategy clearly states that the issue of a rail link to Navan should be kept under review and that the corridor previously identified for a Navan rail link should be protected from development.</p><p>This issue remains under review and will be specifically considered again as part of the statutory review of the current Strategy which must be reviewed every 6 years following publication.

Some important governance reforms have already taken place, most notably the appointment of a new Independent Chairman and Independent Directors to the Board of the organisation. In our discussions with the new Chairman, Minister of State Brendan Griffin and I have emphasised the need for a culture change in the association and to implement structural reforms to safeguard the changes made so far. </p></reply>

In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, AIM Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting.  </p>  <p>  AIM level 7 funding is allocated in response to need, reflecting both the needs of the child and the needs of the specific pre-school setting that the child attends, and is not allocated on the basis of diagnosis. Assessments of a child's needs in the context of the pre-school setting are made by Better Start early years specialists.</p>  <p>  In the case to which the Deputy's question refers, a Better Start early years specialist carried out both a telephone review and an observation visit to the setting. It was found that AIM Level 7 funding was not critical to the child's meaningful participation in the pre-school setting. In this case the ratio of staff to children in the room was deemed sufficient to support the child's needs. AIM Level 4 supports, which involve the provision of expert educational advice and mentoring by Better Start to the setting, were recommended to be sufficient in this case.</p></reply>

I am aware of potential challenges that some School-Age Childcare (SAC) services may face as legacy childcare schemes are phased out in favour of the National Childcare Scheme. As explained below, the policy intent of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) followed much consideration and aims to better serve children and families in the short, medium and long term. A number of mitigations were however also put in place to help services in this transitional phase to address these challenges.</p>  <p>  The Childcare Support Act, from which the NCS stems, includes a number of policy objectives related to combatting poverty and avoiding poverty traps which were inherent in the old schemes. The NCS provides that children will have access to development or education every day for a minimum of three hours, whether it is provided through school or subsidised Early Learning and Care (ELC). This is referred to as &lsquo;Standard Hours&rsquo;, and children are eligible if at least one parent or guardian is not in work, education or training.  Where both of a child&rsquo;s parents or guardians are in work, education or training, or their single parent in lone parent circumstances, the child may be eligible for up to eight hours of subsidised ELC per day. This level of eligibility is referred to as &lsquo;Enhanced Hours.&rsquo; Under Budget 2020, these will increase to four hours per day (20 per week) and nine hours per day (45 per week) respectively in September.</p>  <p>  Enhanced Hours includes additional &lsquo;wrap-around&rsquo; hours on top of time spent in school or accessing ECCE; time spent in school or an ECCE service is subtracted from the total. Standard Hours do not &lsquo;wrap around&rsquo; school hours, however. Children eligible for Standard Hours will not be eligible for subsidised hours of care outside of school during term time, given that a parent/guardian is at home and the child will have already received the development or education NCS is intended to provide to all children while at school. </p>  <p>  While there is a potential challenge for some School-Age Childcare services currently reliant on CCSP for their income, services have a number of options to consider. If a high proportion of their client-base will be eligible for Standard Hours only, they may no longer have enough children attending to be viable. Some of the parents may be incentivised to take up a training programme or some part-time work in which instance they will have access to 40/45 hours per week for a younger child or 17/22 hours for a school age child. Some geographical areas have a shortage of school-age childcare places. Services in these areas may be able to offer a service to new children. The School-Age Childcare Action Plan published in 2017 set out a range of actions to develop school-age childcare services. Subsidies available under the National Childcare Scheme are expected to create greater demand for these services and hence may compensate many services for loss of income from legacy schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, under Budget 2020, the existing &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangement was extended, to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. In this Budget, additional funding was secured to extend the savers beyond August 2020. This means that persons who are registered on the CCS or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them indefinitely, for example, until they no longer require early learning and care or school age childcare.  Officials in my Department have been made aware of some confusion on this point in the sector, so it bears emphasis that the &lsquo;savers&rsquo; arrangement allows children registered for CCSP in November 2019 to continue accessing those subsidies for as long as they are eligible. This means that numbers of children accessing CCSP will gradually taper off rather than ceasing abruptly, giving services time to adapt. </p>  <p>  A new funding model for all services, and with a specific focus on catering to disadvantaged children, is also under development as part of First Five. My Department is currently supporting an international Expert Group and will begin a series of consultations with national stakeholders later this month. SAC services that experience challenges arising from the phasing out of CCSP, and which find that the wider benefits of the National Childcare Scheme have not compensated for this, may well be eligible for other funding supports under this new funding model when it is launched.</p>  <p>  Any SAC services that currently faces challenges &ndash; arising from any cause &ndash; are encouraged to access Case Management support. My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to services in difficulty.  All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p></reply>

A paper based application process will be available very shortly. The Scheme aims to:</p><p>- improve outcomes for children,</p><p>- reduce poverty,</p><p>- facilitate labour activation, and,</p><p>- tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families.</p><p>I am delighted with the very high volume of applications received so far. Over 29,700 applications, relating to over 38,800 children, have already been successfully submitted and over 33,600 awards have been communicated to parents. These cover both universal and income based subsidies. Parents must bring this award to their childcare provider and once their provider has registered the details, payments begin to flow. </p><p>The Scheme provides the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare.  To date, 3,646 childcare services have contracted to provide the NCS. Over 4,000 providers availed of training in advance of the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.</p><p>&quot;Sponsored&quot; applications are now being processed under the Scheme, with over 100 completed sponsor applications received to date. The Childcare Support Act 2018 makes provision for referrals from sponsor bodies for children in certain disadvantaged or challenging circumstances. Where such a referral is made by a sponsor body, the child will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, without their family having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements.  </p><p>Arrangements are in place to monitor the success of the National Childcare Scheme in meeting its objectives, and the Scheme has been designed to be flexible and responsive. Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 provides for a review of the operation of the scheme to commence 12 months after the first payment of subsidies under the scheme. A report of this review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The stated policy intention of section 26 of the legislation was to ensure an early review of the Scheme to identify, in a timely way, any key issues or challenges which need to be addressed rapidly. A longer-term review will also be carried out after three years. </p><p>The Scheme also has a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework in place to support both ongoing and periodic assessment of the Scheme&rsquo;s success in meeting its objectives, including its objectives in supporting labour market activation and female labour market activation. It sets out the measures which policy-makers will use to monitor the Scheme on a continual basis, as well as to evaluate the Scheme at regular intervals, through a system of regular reporting by Pobal to the Department. </p><p>Information on the scheme for parents and providers is available at ncs.gov.ie </p></reply>

The Draft Childminding Action Plan is firmly based on the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector ('Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding'), which was chaired by Childminding Ireland and included a number of representatives from the early learning and care sector.</p>  <p>  Childminding is of huge importance to children, to parents, to our economy, and to our society. Until now, however, it has not received the support it deserves in terms of public funding or our system of quality assurance or regulation. The Draft Action Plan aims to recognise the valuable work that childminders do and to ensure they can access the supports they need. The Draft Action Plan sets out positive reform proposals to bring childminding into the mainstream of regulation, funding and support.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the unique nature of a childminding service; that is why I established the expert group and called for the development of a bespoke plan for childminders. The Draft Childminding Action Plan makes clear that the intention is to develop regulations that are specific and appropriate to childminding, and to develop customised training and resources to support the quality of childminding provision, including through the development of staffed local networks to provide professional development and peer support. The new regulation and inspection process for childminders is yet to be developed, but the Draft Childminding Action Plan stresses the importance of regulation and inspection being proportionate and appropriate to the home and family setting in which childminders work.</p>  <p>  The public consultation process on the Draft Action Plan took place between August and November 2019. It was widely publicised on social media, through National Voluntary Organisations (including Childminding Ireland) and City/County Childcare Committees. The consultation process was carefully designed to ensure strong participation by childminders. In particular, a series of 32 focus groups were organised around the country by the local City and County Childcare Committees, with the help of the new team of regional Childminding Development Officers that I have put in place. The focus groups were organised in evenings to make it easier for childminders to take part. </p>  <p>  In addition to the focus groups in the evenings, an Open Policy Debate took place in the daytime to facilitate participation by other stakeholders. There was also an online survey and a call for submissions. The online survey had 467 respondents, of whom 57% were childminders.</p>  <p>  A report on the consultation process is being finalised for publication. Revisions to the Draft Plan are currently being made in response to the consultation findings.</p></reply>

Along with this the Oireachtas has also recognised the need for a separate register of stillbirths. This register was established to record the stillbirth of a child who had reached a gestational term of 24 weeks or weighs no less than 500 grammes and shows no signs of life at birth. This approach is in line with international practice.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to the register would require consideration and approval from the Government.</p></reply>

This means that a person over 65 years and in receipt of jobseekers benefit will generally continue to receive benefit (even if it was due to exhaust after 9 or 6 months dependant on the PRSI contributions paid) until they reach State pension age if they continue to satisfy the rules of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme.  Similarly, people who retire on or after 1 January 2021 before reaching the State pension age of 67  who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and have at least 156 PRSI contribution weeks paid may continue to receive a jobseekers payment until pension age.</p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age in Ireland and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employer. While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65 in the context of previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment by one or more years if both parties agree.   </p>  <p>   Any changes to the above would require consideration in the overall policy and budgetary context, and would require Government approval.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Before then, payment could be made where the level of disablement went from 1% to 100%.  Disablement Benefit may be paid as a once off gratuity or in the form of a disablement pension. </p>  <p>  The maximum rate of disablement pension (for 100% loss of faculty) increased over the years from its inception in 1967 to a height of &euro;235.40 per week in 2009.  The rate was reduced to &euro;219.00 per week for the years 2011 to 2016 inclusive.  However. it has been increased again in successive Social Welfare Acts in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and it is now &euro;234 per week.</p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  Any change to the current arrangements for disablement pension would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-03-05a.3355.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020030500109#WRQQQ01600"><p>I understand the vital role local businesses play in supporting local authorities to deliver services to their communities. Commercial rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income. </p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by law to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details, entered in the valuation lists. The lists are prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates, I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 for enactment last year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.  </p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority and the Minister for Finance has no direct function in the matter.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. Interestingly, in terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.  </p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond set parameters, for example, taking account of normal inflation. RLOs have been made for each of the 23 local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in respect of the remaining local authorities where revaluations are to be concluded in the coming years. </p>  <p>  At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal and beyond that to the Courts on a point of law. </p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 further facilitates such flexible approaches, on the basis that ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned. </p>  <p>  Importantly, Section 15 the new Act also provides for a rates waiver schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and/or local policy objectives, including for example, local area plans under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and local economic and community plans under the Local Government Act 2001. </p>  <p>  Prior to local authorities deciding their 2020 budgets, my Department wrote to all local authorities highlighting the new waiver provisions, contained in the 2019 Act, indicating that the work in respect of commencing Section 15 is underway and to make a provision in their budgets if they planned to implement a waiver scheme in 2020.   </p>  <p>  Last October I, along with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, met with members of the Retail Consultation Forum and it was agreed that a separate meeting on Commercial Rates and Valuation could be beneficial in sharing experiences and working together to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commercial Rates and Valuation regimes.  </p>  <p>  My Department proposes to convene such a meeting between representatives of the Retail Consultation Forum, the Valuation office and local authorities to explore a number of thematic issues such as sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s cities, towns and villages; the experience of retail ratepayers in terms of valuation and rates at a systemic level; and the implementation of the Rates and Other Matters Act 2019.</p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department has sought initial input from the members of the Retail Consultation Forum to the development of an agenda for this engagement.</p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been recently finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. </p>  <p>  This issue is part of a significant body of work undertaken in my Department in relation to the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect that the review will be published once all the work on these reform measures are completed.</p></reply>

In general, public buildings are considered to fall within this class and, as such, may utilise the existing exemption. There also exist further exemptions relating to the installation of solar panels on industrial buildings and in agricultural holdings, again subject to certain siting and size conditions. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulations, and is actively engaging with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations - to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate the generation of energy for self-consumption. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force.</p></reply>

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now targeted to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for local authority vacant stock. During 2019, expenditure of some &euro;26.6 million was recouped by local authorities under the Voids Programme. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area. There is however a commitment under Rebuilding Ireland that local authorities will introduce a preventative maintenance approach to the management of their housing stock and it is logical that this will be significantly funded by the rental income from that same housing stock.  My Department is in discussions on this with the City &amp;amp; County Management Association on behalf of local authorities. </p>  <p>  In relation to Cavan County Council, the local authority has received &euro;1.65 million of funding from 2014 to 2019, resulting in 137 units being returned to use. While my Department will examine proposals from Cavan County Council under the voids programme in 2020, it would be of concern if there is any reduction in the local authority housing maintenance budgets and resultant capacity to maintain housing stock. The support of elected members for adequate budgetary provision for this important work will ensure quick re-letting of vacant housing and the adequate maintenance of all local authority housing stock.</p></reply>

Furthermore, whilst my Department is supporting Dublin City Council, and indeed other local authorities in their plans to provide more affordable housing on their lands, it is, ultimately, the responsibility of the each respective Council and their elected members to progress such schemes.</p><p>Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 which covers Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, was commenced in June 2018.  This now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. </p><p>Under these provisions, I signed regulations in respect of the making of a Scheme of Priority on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  I can confirm that Dublin City Council members agreed the Council's Scheme of Priority in May of 2019 and I approved this Scheme in early July 2019.</p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters.</p><p>In order to support local authorities in their delivery of discounted homes, Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  The Fund is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable homes, either to buy or rent, can be delivered.  At a maximum amount of &euro;50,000 per home, it is anticipated at least 6,200 more affordable homes can be provided. The SSF is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and a viability to deliver such housing on their sites.</p><p>Full details of the projects approved under the 1st and 2nd SSF call for proposals, including those in Dublin City and County Council areas, is available at the following links: </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It is intended to issue a further SSF call for proposals to local authorities later this year.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Dublin City Council is progressing with its plans for the delivery of affordable housing on its lands. Documentation available on the Council website, which was published in advance of the Council meeting of 2 March 2020, indicates a potential for 1,989 more affordable homes across 10 schemes.  In addition to this, there is a potential 1,275 cost rental units across 4 schemes.

However, it has always been the case that such an approach needs to be used carefully, focusing on priority situations, with local authorities seeking to ensure that they do not interfere unduly with the local private market.  Local authorities should also be mindful of their construction programmes and those of AHBs; where these programmes are delivering new build social housing, this should be a priority rather than undertaking significant programmes of acquisitions.</p>  <p>  This approach will continue into 2020 under Rebuilding Ireland and, in the case of Galway City and County Councils, it is particularly notable that their construction programmes for new social housing, are significantly higher for 2020 and 2021, compared with previous years.  It's important therefore, that the efforts and resources of the local authorities are focused more significantly on their construction programmes and that they continue to use acquisitions in line with the above approach, where appropriate for priority situations.</p>  <p>  In locations where, for example, a new build approach is not envisaged for social housing delivery, I would encourage local authorities to acquire and refurbish properties that may be derelict or in need of upgrade. Programmes such as 'Repair &amp;amp; Lease' and 'Buy &amp;amp; Renew' support such work or local authorities may undertake a construction project to remediate older properties.</p></reply>

The consultation closed on 19 February 2020.</p><p>Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020.</p><p>The regulations came into operation on 31 January 2020, and my Department is currently in the process of finalising guidelines, which will be available in the coming weeks, to promote and support a consistent approach to the operation and administration of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme by Donegal and Mayo County Councils. The aim now is to commence the receipt of applications without delay.</p><p>The defective concrete blocks grant scheme is primarily a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved  costs per dwelling under the scheme range from &euro;275,000 to &euro;55,000 depending on the remedial option. A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.</p><p>The scheme is targeted at assisting a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress. It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.</p><p>Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process and additional funding can be provided should it be required. Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective outcomes.</p><p>Separately, the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency. The pyrite remediation scheme was first adopted in February 2014. </p><p>While the Act provides that the scheme can be amended, replaced or revoked, this can only be done in accordance with the scope of the Act. The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite or mica in concrete blocks. </p><p>The Pyrite Remediation Scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie.</p><p>In regard to planning permission and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme,  the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended), provide that &ldquo;development&rdquo; includes any associated demolition works. Consequently, the demolition and rebuild of affected dwellings will require planning permission. However, requirements regarding planning permission and contributions are ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.</p><p>Finally, the Building Regulations (as amended), apply to the construction of new buildings, extensions and material alterations to existing buildings. The five remedial options provided for under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme constitute a material alteration to an existing building. </p><p>Any works that are beyond the requirements of the current building regulations for existing dwellings, or any works that are not required for or ancillary to the remediation of damage to the dwelling arising out of, or in connection with, the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction, while not prohibited, do not qualify for grant assistance under the scheme. In this context, energy upgrades beyond the requirements of the current building regulations for  existing dwellings, do not qualify for grant assistance under this scheme.</p><p>Similarly, in line with Government policy on waste prevention and value for money considerations, the reuse, recovery and recycling of materials, is encouraged where possible. The costs associated with the unnecessary replacement of items such as windows, doors and kitchen units, do not qualify for grant assistance under this scheme.<b></b></p><p>The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. </p></reply>

The HAP limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  In reviewing rent limits, my Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly in July 2016, in the order of 60% in some cases.</p><p>Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p><p>Taking account of the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, and up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness, I am satisfied that the HAP scheme is operating effectively. </p><p>I am also conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in TGD B, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. </p>  <p>  The design of apartments, in Ireland, has been evolving over recent years, as design teams learn from best practice around the world. In particular, open plan apartments are becoming increasingly popular. TGD B 2006 did not provide specific guidance on open plan apartment arrangements. In 2018, following liaison with Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), a working group of experts from DFB and my Department was set up to examine the issue of open plan apartments in Ireland and develop appropriate guidance.</p>  <p>  In developing the additional guidance, standards, tests, engineering approaches were considered and fire safety requirements in a number of jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, America, Australia, Denmark and Hong Kong were reviewed.   </p>  <p>  The aim of the additional national guidance is to provide both local authorities and industry with greater clarity on how to achieve and demonstrate compliance with Part B for open plan apartments and to promote consistency across the country. </p>  <p>  The additional guidance amending TGD B 2006 published in February 2020 has a number of provisions for buildings containing apartments and includes a new section specifying provisions for open plan apartments. </p>  <p>  In relation to internal layouts and provisions for open plan apartments with travel distances exceeding 9m, the guidance provides for  </p>  <p>  - sprinkler protection within the apartment to control fire development; </p>  <p>  - maximum travel distances within the apartment of 20m;  </p>  <p>  - single storey apartments only;</p>  <p>  - an enhanced fire detection and alarm systems within the apartment; interconnected alarms in circulation areas, bedrooms and high risk areas to ensure early detection and warning of a fire; and </p>  <p>  - enclosed kitchens or a distance of 1.8m from the main kitchen cooking appliances to the escape route, which is in line with international research and testing.</p>  <p>  For smaller apartments, with travel distances less than or equal to 9m, the guidance in TGD B has not changed. TGD B has referenced BS 5588 Part 1: 1990 since the introduction of Building Regulations in 1991, and this continues to be applicable. In these apartments, the travel distances from the flat entrance door to any point in any habitable room cannot exceed 9 m, no habitable room can be an inner room, the position of any cooking facilities should be remote from the dwelling entrance door and not prejudice the escape route from any point in the apartment. This typically applies to small studio type flats with open internal layouts. </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the additional guidance to TGD B published in February 2020 does not permit a distance of 1.8 metres from the escape route to the main kitchen cooking appliance in non-sprinklered apartments.  It should also be noted that an escape route from a bedroom cannot be through a kitchen in a non-sprinklered apartment, as no habitable room can be an inner room in accordance with BS 5588 Part 1: 1990, as currently referenced in TGDB. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the additional guidance to TGD B published in February 2020 provides guidance on other aspects of fire safety for buildings containing apartments and these are set out at the beginning of reprint TGD B 2020.  All of the guidance in TGD B (Reprint 2020) should be considered collectively, as fire safety must be addressed in a holistic manner, considering building resilience and ensuring a building is safe for occupant egress and firefighter operations simultaneously.</p></reply>

Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings, to which the local authorities are not party. </p><p>My Department does not hold the loan agreements under CALF, as the loan agreement, is between the local authority and the relevant AHB.  Accordingly, information on the number and value of CALF loans, including the balance owning and associated due date, is held by the relevant local authorities.  The value and the term of each CALF loan varies by project.</p><p>While my Department does not hold the loan agreements, the following is a table of CALF-related monies drawn down from my Department since 2016 by the various local authorities.</p><p>  ">Tables</p></reply>

This includes the ongoing transformation process to position Irish Water as the single, publicly owned national water services authority, accountable to the Oireachtas.  Related to this process, the Government decided in July 2018 that Irish Water would be separated from the Ervia Group during 2023.</p>  <p>  In this context, Irish Water has proposed fully integrating its operations and ending the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through service level agreements with local authorities.  As this proposal will give rise to significant organisational change for local authorities and their staff, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has been tasked with facilitating engagement between the key stakeholders, namely, Irish Water / Ervia; ICTU and relevant affiliated unions (Forsa, SIPTU, Connect and UNITE); and the County and City Management Association / Local Government Management Agency.   </p>  <p>  Three interlinked elements have been identified which the new arrangements must address: </p>  <p>  (a) To provide Irish Water with the necessary control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk and communicate and negotiate with all water services workers on the change agenda and provide a single identity for customer facing services;</p>  <p>  (b) To ensure that Irish Water is not left without an appropriate skilled workforce to carry out its statutory functions and local authorities are not left with stranded costs; and,</p>  <p>  (c) To address the concerns of workers in relation to the future deployment of the current local authority water staff.  </p>  <p>  The formal engagement under the WRC commenced in February 2019 and three formal meetings and a number of bilateral meetings have been held to date. </p>  <p>  There are also constitutional and governance issues that are of interest and relevant to the future provision of water services in Ireland.  These matters have been discussed with relevant stakeholders in different strands of dialogue outside of the WRC process and will be a matter for a new Government and Oireachtas to progress.</p></reply>

Due to the quasi-judicial and independent role of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in specific disputes. </p><p>Security of tenure for tenants is provided for under the Residential Tenancies Acts. Section 34 provides for a landlord to state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the allowable grounds for terminations. </p><p>The  Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish/renovate the property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant who provides their contact details, upon completion of the works. Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment/renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such a risk would be likely to exist for at least 3 weeks.  </p><p>The 2019 Act also provides additional powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions. My Department will continue to keep the effectiveness and enforcement of the security of tenure provisions in the Acts under review.  </p><p>With regard to planning policy guidance, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines (available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.housing.gov.ie</i>) under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (the 2000 Act), to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities. </p><p>Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission are not being met.  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the 2000 Act in this regard. </p><p>Under section 30 of the 2000 Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. Accordingly, I cannot comment in relation to any particular case.</p><p>Planning permission is required for any development of land or property unless it is specifically exempted under the 2000 Act  or the associated Planning and Development Regulations 2001. </p><p>Under section 5 of the 2000 Act, where any question arises as to, what in any particular case, is or is not development or is or is not exempted development within the meaning of the Act, any person may on payment of the prescribed fee, request in writing from the relevant planning authority a declaration on that question. Any person seeking such a declaration has to provide the planning authority with any information considered necessary by the planning authority to make its decision.</p></reply>

When the RIHL was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. The RIHL proved to be more successful than initially anticipated and following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform an increase in funding of &euro;363.6 million for 2018-2019 was communicated to all 31 local authorities on 15 August 2019. </p><p>When the RIHL was introduced on 1 February 2018 three interest rate products were offered:</p><p>1.  variable interest rate priced at 2.3%; </p><p>2. A 25 year fixed rate priced at 2%</p><p>3. A 30 year fixed rate priced at 2.25%</p><p>From August 2019 the variable interest rate was no longer offered as part of the scheme.</p><p>Loans issued under the RIHL must be on a prudential basis so as to protect the financial interests of both borrowers and local authorities, and I have highlighted in the past that this could, for future tranches of funding, result in changes to the operation of the scheme, including inter alia interest rates, depending on the performance of the loan.</p><p>An independent review of the RIHL was undertaken in 2019 by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). This review strongly endorsed the RIHL as a positive affordability measure. However, it recommended that the cost of the RIHL should be comparable to that of the longest fixed rate mortgage available in Ireland, which is typically 10 years.</p><p>Accordingly, following engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the interest rate on RIHL mortgages increased by 0.745%. This increase will not apply to loans issued on applications received before 15 January 2020. Similarly the cost of existing RIHL loans is unchanged because the RIHL rate is fixed for the lifetime of the loan unlike any other mortgage currently in Irish market. </p><p>This interest rate increase is appropriate because;</p><p>&Oslash; The additional revenue will fund an increase in the contribution to the Local Authority Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (LA MARP) Premium Fund from 0.25% to 0.995% which will increase the funding available to support the resolution of unsustainable arrears.  The LA MARP Premium Fund was established in 2012 to support local authorities in dealing with the shortfalls that arise in resolving unsustainable arrears. </p><p>&Oslash; As RIHL loans are targeted at higher risk borrowers it is important that credit risk is adequately priced into the cost of the loan to ensure that this product remains viable and sustainable.</p><p>&Oslash; It is important to ensure that those borrowers who can get credit in the commercial market do so, and are not incentivised to attempt to gain access to this scheme to avail of cheaper interest rates. It is essential that limited state resources remain focused on maximising the benefit to those who are most in need of the support which this product offers.  </p><p>Further additional funding for lending of up to &euro;210 million has now been secured to ensure the continuation of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans scheme (RIHL) into 2020.</p></reply>
