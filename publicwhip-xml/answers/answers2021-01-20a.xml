CETA is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures that flow from CETA all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market with more than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.</p><p>Diversifying trade is an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in our recovery post-pandemic.  To this end, the best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving market access and reducing costs of entering those markets which is what CETA is designed to achieve.  Given our historic ties with Canada, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to benefit from CETA.</p><p>The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include:</p><p>- the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing;</p><p>- unlimited tariff-free access for most of our important food exports;</p><p>- a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area; and</p><p>- the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Furthermore, the benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  Indeed, CETA contains an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at ensuring they can take full advantage of the improved market access.</p><p>In services and investment, CETA is the most far-reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded.  Almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector where CETA makes it easier for EU individuals and companies to provide services to Canadian customers and vice versa.  It covers services such as legal, accountancy, transport and telecoms and there are significant opportunities for Ireland given its strengths in services, with services exports accounting for approximately 60% of all exports in 2019.</p><p>Provisional application is a standard mechanism provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement has been voted for by Council and the European Parliament.  It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years. The provisions in force since 21st September 2017 include: </p><p>- the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, </p><p>- access to the Canadian procurement market, </p><p>- the easing of regulatory barriers and</p><p>- more transparent rules for market access. </p><p>The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.  </p><p>All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  </p><p>ISDS, which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest.  ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA.</p><p>ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:</p><p>- Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;</p><p>- Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;</p><p>- Provisions for the swift dismissal of frivolous claims should they arise;</p><p>- The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;</p><p>- The avoidance of multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and national courts, and;</p><p>- The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.</p><p>The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve:</p><p>- a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;</p><p>- the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases; and  </p><p>- precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.</p><p>It is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts whether CETA exists or not.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative.  That alternative, unlike a challenge in the courts, cannot find any act by Government to be <i>ultra vires</i>or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm.</p><p>Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe they have been discriminated against.  In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions.  The Investment Court System provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.  </p><p>It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced.  Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government.  Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment.</p><p>Additionally, as one of the first &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; EU Free Trade Agreements, CETA contains a dedicated chapter on Trade and the Environment.  The Agreement has some of the strongest commitments ever included in a trade deal to promote labour rights, environmental protection and sustainable development.  CETA integrates the EU's and Canada's commitments to apply international rules on workers' rights, environmental protection and climate action.  These obligations, which came into force at the time of provisional application are binding, with the same legal value as any other provision. Furthermore, the Agreement includes commitments towards the sustainable management of forests, fisheries and aquaculture.  It also reinforces the Parties' commitments to multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party, including the Paris Agreement, which is an important shared responsibility for the EU and Canada.  Both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.</p><p>The EU Commission published a Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment relating to the negotiation of CETA in June 2011.  This study provided a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of trade liberalisation under CETA.  The impact analysis assessed the economic, social and environmental impacts in Canada and the European Union, in three main sectors, sixteen sub-sectors and seven cross-cutting issues.  In addition to examining potential gains from removing factors affecting the free flow of goods, services and capital, consideration was given to areas such as labour mobility, government procurement, intellectual property rights, telecommunications services and electronic commerce. Overall the impact assessment found that the sustainability impacts to Canada and the European Union would not be significant.  </p><p>At a national level, my Department has commissioned econometric modelling on the impacts of CETA. Analysis to date estimates that Ireland&rsquo;s GDP will be 0.2 percent higher in 2030 than would have been the case in a baseline scenario without CETA.  It also finds total global exports from Ireland will be 0.7 percent higher in 2030 as a result of CETA.  In addition, the current modelling estimates that, given that existing average tariffs on exports to Canada are relatively low (0.3% weighted average), the main benefits for Irish exporters stemming from CETA arise from a 10 percent reduction in non-tariff barrier costs on Ireland&rsquo;s exports to Canada.</p><p>The combination of export-led growth and foreign direct investment has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s economy over recent decades.  As a small, open, economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we fully support balanced international trade and the collection of EU Free Trade Agreements that seek to underpin this.  This Agreement and the EU's other Trade Agreements are key instruments to assist the work of Enterprise Ireland in supporting Irish Enterprise in global markets.  Moreover, the Investment Protection elements of CETA make the EU - and Ireland - a more attractive location for mobile Canadian FDI and also affords protections for Irish-based enterprises investing in Canada as part of their internationalisation. </p><p>In September 2017, Belgium requested the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the compatibility of the ICS with EU law.  The Opinion of the Court in Case 1/17 was issued on 30th April 2019 and held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with (i) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, (ii) the principle of equal treatment and of the requirement of effectiveness of EU law, and (iii) the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter. </p><p>In conclusion, I believe that the foregoing assessments have already made a strong case as to the benefits for the EU and Ireland deriving from CETA.  Furthermore, the EU produces an FTA Annual Implementation Report  which identifies progress with FTA deliverables and which can inform further actions if required.  Finally, the European Commission has recently appointed a Chief Trade Enforcement Officer who is tasked with overseeing effective implementation and observance of commitments in our list of EU FTAs, including CETA. </p></reply>

These requirements can be complex, but it is essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect public health, food safety and product standards as well as the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new rules and procedures that are now in place, including the Ready for Customs Grant scheme and the Clear Customs training programme.  Officials and State Agencies have also been providing support and assistance on a 24/7 basis when practical difficulties with the new rules and procedures arise.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that some businesses have found that it has taken longer to move goods through our ports, but it is important to note that a significant number of businesses have successfully made the transition to the new trading environment. These businesses are successfully submitting Customs declarations and receiving the associated Master Reference Numbers (MRNs) and are using these MRNs to create and populate the Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN). In recent days, more than 70% of goods being imported through Dublin Port, for example, are being green routed on arrival meaning they can leave the port without the need for additional interaction with Customs or other State agencies.  </p>  <p>  As regards the performance of Revenue&rsquo;s Customs IT systems, I am advised by Revenue that in most cases, further investigation of specific issues raised with them has revealed that the actual error has been as a result of incorrect data rather than a systems issue. However, there have also been some systems issues and, in such cases, Revenue issued clear and timely communications that enabled affected businesses to continue to move their goods. These notifications are available on the Revenue website but are also automatically issued to businesses that have signed up to receive Revenue eCustoms Notifications. I am assured by Revenue that it was not a systems issue that led to the introduction of a temporary easement measure provided to trade and business in regard to the import safety and security declaration (ENS) declaration.  PBNs are being successfully filed on a daily basis by trade and business. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied based on the examination of the issues undertaken by Revenue and the assurance provided to me by Revenue that the customs IT systems are functioning well and are robust and resilient. I do, of course, fully appreciate the difficulties that arise for business when even short-term issues impact on business and the efficiency with which they can move goods. I fully support the Revenue approach of working with individual businesses and with the relevant trade representative bodies to assist them in building the understanding and knowledge of customs formalities and ensuring compliance with same so that goods movements between Ireland and Great Britain can be as efficient as possible, mindful of the fact that the trading environment changed irrevocably following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. </p></reply>

These include the Department of Finance, the Central Statistics Office, and the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In terms of my Department, the Economic the Social Research Institute undertook research at the request of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) in 2018 on the impact of Brexit on consumers in Ireland to help inform a wider understanding of the potential impact of Brexit and assist in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s preparations. The study found that there was likely to be an increase in the cost of living depending on the scenario that would apply after the Brexit process had concluded. </p>  <p>  The CSO's most recent data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2020 was published on 14 January last and contains detailed information about changes in the average prices of food &amp;amp; non-alcoholic beverages. Prices on average for food &amp;amp; non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.1% in the month to December 2020 with food prices rising 0.1% and prices for non-alcoholic beverages falling by 1.6%. Over the previous 12-months, the price of food &amp;amp; non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.6% with food prices falling by 1.1% and non-alcoholic beverages prices falling by 4.4%. The CPI statistics for food and non-alcoholic beverages for January 2021 will be published on 18 February next.</p>  <p>  Clearly, it is too early to tell how Brexit is affecting retail food prices. It is likely that there will be some changes in pricing by retailers arising from disruptions caused by Brexit and as supply chains are re-configured to deal with Brexit realities. My Department is in regular contact with retailers to identify if there are any vulnerabilities apparent in their supply chains. This engagement will continue and challenges to supply logistics are actively monitored by my officials. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s 2021 budget allocation of &euro;1.13bn represents an increase of &euro;154 million or 15.9% on the 2020 allocation. This is in addition to &euro;100 million earmarked from the Recovery Fund for Brexit. This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the value of goods and services imported from the UK to Ireland was &euro;31 bn, which represented 14% of Ireland's total imports that year.  In 2019, while the value of goods and services imported from the UK to Ireland had increased to &euro;41 bn, this represented the lower percentage of 11% of Ireland&rsquo;s total imports in that year. The total value of goods and services imported into Ireland increased from &euro;223 bn in 2015 to &euro;388 bn in 2019.</p>  <p>  Similarly, for exports, in 2015 the value of goods and services exported to the UK was &euro;37.2 bn which accounted for 16% of total exports from Ireland.  In 2019 the value of exports to the UK had increased to &euro;51.6 bn but this represented the lower percentage of 14% of Ireland&rsquo;s total exports that year. In the period 2015 to 2019, the value of total exports from Ireland increased by &euro;135 bn or 57%, to a record level of &euro;374bn.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2019 of &euro;25.6bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2019, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 15% to &euro;5.65bn, while exports to North America increased from &euro;4.08bn in 2018 to &euro;4.72bn, an increase of 16%. In the same period exports to the UK increased by 2%.</p>  <p>  2020 export performance and the outlook for exports to the UK, Eurozone and rest of the world continues to be significantly impacted by both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for 2021 is to sustain Irish jobs and exports and increase the resilience of the enterprise base with a view to ensuring global exports retain their pre-pandemic, pre-Brexit value of &euro;25.6 bn. The agency&rsquo;s focus will be on supporting clients to adapt and succeed in a post-Brexit environment, sustaining existing export sales and accelerating the diversification of Irish exports. While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority. </p>  <p>  In recent years the majority of Ministerial-led Trade Missions have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These Trade Missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences. In 2020,  due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, promotion of our companies abroad continued through the work of our State agencies, and, in particular, their offices located on the ground internationally.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in contact with Enterprise Ireland with a view to developing a Ministerial led Trade Mission Programme for 2021. At this stage, it is envisaged that such a programme will contain a mix of virtual and actual trade missions. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies to sustain their existing export sales and to increasingly diversify their export markets. This will include strengthening sales and marketing capability of companies, with a particular focus on remote/virtual channels and providing targeted financial and advisory supports to companies adversely impacted upon by COVID-19 and Brexit to support their adaptation to the challenging market environment. </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

Using the latest quarterly national accounts data from the CSO, the Arts and Entertainment sector was identified as the sector most affected by COVID-19 related disruption, followed by the Professional, Admin and Support Services Sector and the Construction Sector. The areas of the economy that fared best included the Information and Communications Sector and the Manufacturing Sector, which tend to be dominated by foreign owned multinational enterprises.</p>  <p>  The resilience of the multinational sector and its importance to the Irish economy is highlighted by the fact employment in IDA Ireland client companies actually increased by almost 9,000 in the year to September 2020, highlighting the resilience of these multinational enterprises and the important role these firms play in the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Many sectors of the domestic economy have been particularly hard hit with widespread job losses. In January 2021, the sector with the highest levels of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment was Accommodation and Food Service Activities, followed by Wholesale and Retail Trade. </p>  <p>  The domestic sector, and employment within the sector, has been most impacted by COVID-19 disruption. The Government has introduced the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Support Scheme (EWSS) to aid employees. </p>  <p>  To help businesses to adjust to the challenges of the pandemic and ensure they are in a position to benefit once the economy re-opens, several schemes have been introduced, including loans, grants, vouchers, training and mentoring programmes. Small and medium firms are the biggest source of employment in the Irish economy and the Government will continue to support these businesses as they will be a crucial element of Ireland's recovery. </p></reply>

Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers and that care is often expressed in the form of negotiation, compromise and flexibility. Some of the options to be considered for workers with caring responsibilities that preclude them from working their normal hours in the normal, pre-Covid way include - </p><p>- Offering paid compassionate leave,</p><p>- Allowing employees to work from home,</p><p>- Altering shifts, so that employees can coordinate caring between themselves and partners, or another person,</p><p>- Allowing employees to rearrange holidays,</p><p>- Allowing employees to rearrange parental leave, </p><p>- Allowing employees to take paid time off that can be worked back at a later time etc.</p><p>- Allowing employees to take unpaid leave until they can return to work full or part-time.</p><p>I would encourage any employees affected by the lack of childcare to engage with their employer in the first instance to explore all options available to enable them to continue working.  I would encourage employers to be as flexible and supportive as possible with a view to maintaining good employment relationships over the long term.</p><p>In circumstances where employers fail to consider any reasonable accommodations, employees may have recourse to pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) under the relevant legislation such as Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 or the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015. </p><p>If the employee has availed of an arrangement with their employer then that agreement should have regard to the issue of service. </p><p>If however they have left employment temporarily, then service would not accrue. </p></reply>

When this emergency provision ceases to have effect, eligible employees will be able to make a claim for redundancy from their employer. The employer can then agree to the redundancy payment if they do not have work to offer the employee, or they can give counter notice by offering the employee not less than 13 weeks unbroken employment.</p>  <p>  Under existing provisions, in situations where an employer cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments due to financial difficulties, the Department of Social Protection provides a safety net for both employers and employees and can make the statutory redundancy payment to eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund on behalf of the employer. When such a redundancy payment is made, a debt is raised against the employer.</p>  <p>  That Department will engage with employers to establish their financial situation on a case by case basis and will seek to recover the debt on a mutually agreed basis. Since the start of the pandemic, the Government has been very mindful of the difficulties that employers are facing. Where appropriate an agreed repayment plan can be put in place to minimise financial hardship on an employer. For example, the debt can be recovered by way of instalments over a period of time.</p>  <p>  There has been ongoing dialogue with both employee and employer representative groups on the continued operation of the emergency provision, Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.</p>  <p>  The Government has also put in place unprecedented levels of financial supports for businesses in response to the Covid-19 crisis which provides employers with the security of continued assistance, thereby sustaining jobs.</p></reply>

These  lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and other issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.</p>  <p>  With effect from 2017, the occupation of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver has been eligible for a General Employment Permit, subject to a quota initially of 120 employment permits.

Secondly, the EIB EASI counter guarantee, which MFI has access to, only covers individual loans to a maximum of &euro;25,000.

However, in situations where an employer cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments due to financial difficulties, the Department of Social Protection provides a safety net for both employers and employees and can make the statutory redundancy payment to eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund on behalf of the employer. When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is raised against the employer. The Department of Social Protection is legally obliged to make every effort to recover the debt owed to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  That Department engages directly with the employer to ascertain their financial situation and their capacity to repay the debt. Each case is assessed on its own merits and where appropriate, an agreed repayment plan can be put in place to minimise financial hardship; for example, the debt can be recovered by way of instalments over a period of time. Since the start of the pandemic, the Government have been very mindful of the difficulties that employers are facing. For a time, debt reminder letters did not issue and in some circumstances debt repayments were suspended until the business is in a better financial position. If a closure situation arises, the existing debt recovery mechanisms are flexible enough to adjust the repayment arrangements, thus easing the pressures on employers. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s debt management policy is kept under review but any change to the policy must ensure that employer debt is recovered in full wherever possible. As a safety net already exists as explained above, there are no plans to change legislation in this regard.</p></reply>

In addition, Ministers will have to account annually for their performance in reducing emissions to an Oireachtas Committee. The annual revision to the Climate Action Plan, as well as enhanced ministerial accountability, will combine to act as a further review mechanism and opportunity to re-adjust or refocus actions, if required. </p>  <p>  The Bill has undergone extensive pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Committee on Climate Action. I am currently considering the Committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report and recommendations (published on 18 December 2020) with a view to updating the draft Bill and bringing it to Government as soon as possible for approval to publish it and initiate the legislative process in the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  The scheme has evolved significantly since it was first established in 2000. The scheme was initially based on community referrals and provided simple energy improvements such as lagging jackets and draught proofing. The scheme now provides significant and complex whole home upgrades including external wall insulation and has a current work programme of over 7,000 homes. </p>  <p>  &euro;109 million in capital funding has been provided this year through my Department's Vote to support lower income households to retrofit their homes. &euro;100 million of this funding is allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This represents a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation and is the highest ever budget for this scheme. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is delivered through a panel of suitably trained contractors, appointed following a competitive tendering process. The most recent tender process was held last year.  The tender process was designed to reflect the need to deliver greater numbers of deeper upgrades to households in energy poverty, in line with Government policy. The new contract requires all contractors to be able to deliver all measures, deep and shallow. The process also included a new social considerations criterion. This criterion provided tenderers with the opportunity to demonstrate any relevant social considerations that they employ or use in the delivery of the services they provide. This could include employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access and promoting social inclusion.     </p>  <p>  The process resulted in a new, broader contractor panel with increased capacity to deliver more activity under the Scheme.  A total of five social enterprises/community based organisations were successfully appointed to the panel.  There are no plans to re-open the tender process at this time. </p></reply>

A report prepared by Eunomia for my Department concluded that the introduction of a deposit and return scheme (DRS) is essential if we are to reach these targets. </p>  <p>  The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, launched last September, sets out a clear roadmap for the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme (DRS) for plastic bottles and aluminium cans in the third quarter of 2022. This process began with the launch of a public consultation on the design of a DRS for Ireland in October last. My officials are currently engaged in bi-lateral discussions with a range of stakeholders to progress the design of the system, including waste collectors, drinks producers and retailers and environmental NGOs. While the external report estimated that the introduction of a DRS might result in a small increase in the costs of collecting domestic waste this issue will be considered in detail during these discussions and in the detailed design of the scheme itself. </p></reply>

This allocation will kick-start the first phase of our national retrofit plan. </p>  <p>  It is essential that appropriate structures and governance arrangements are put in place to help us meet our retrofit targets.  For that reason, a further key aspect of phase one of the retrofit plan was the designation, in quarter 4 last year, of the SEAI as the National Retrofit Delivery Office.  Significant additional resources were provided as part of Budget 2021 to increase the capacity of the organisation to drive delivery of our retrofit targets.

This represents a cumulative 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the decade compared to the 30% baseline under the NECP and is consistent with the approach set out at EU level which also aims to be climate neutral by 2050. The European Council has agreed, at its meeting in December 2020, to increase the EU's 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% relative to 1990 levels.

Last year, the European Commission adopted Shaping Europe's Digital Future, which includes an objective to foster an open, democratic and sustainable society. Key actions include initiatives to achieve climate-neutral, highly energy efficient and sustainable data centres by no later than 2030.</p>  <p>  EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029, up from 2% in 2018.     </p>  <p>  Significant increases in volumes of generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s electrification objectives including demand from heat pumps, electric vehicles and data centres.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets out a number of actions to ensure that data centres are accommodated in a sustainable manner including implementing flexible demand and other innovative solutions for data centres. This has been implemented by EirGrid for new data centres seeking to connect in Dublin.The Climate Action Plan also provides that the IDA will use its new strategy to fully integrate decarbonisation objectives across its portfolio of clients. This strategy will seek to ensure new large-scale enterprise investments in Ireland, including factors such as location and power purchase agreement opportunities, are aligned with the build-out of the grid to maximise renewable sources.</p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing by the Renewable Electricity Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) Steering Group, led by the SEAI in order to deliver on the step up in ambition in the Climate Action Plan of meeting 15% of electricity demand from CPPAs by 2030. A set of policy options have been developed in order to increase the take up of CPPAs with an expected consultation on these policy proposals in Q1 2021.</p></reply>

They were replaced by  requirement from 9 of January for passengers originating from Great Britain or South Africa and arriving into Ireland have been required to have evidence of a negative or &ldquo;not detected&rdquo; result of a Covid-19 PCR test obtained within 72 hours of arrival into Ireland. </p>  <p>  Arising from the deteriorating epidemiological situation and the concern at the implications of increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 via the emergence of new variants, the Government extended this requirement to all regions with effect from 16 January. The test must be taken within 72 hours of arrival to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Exemptions include international transport workers- including hauliers, pilots and aviation crew, masters and maritime crew; passengers in transit, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Children aged six and under.</p>  <p>  Passengers will be asked to present evidence of their negative/&lsquo;not detected&rsquo; RT-PCR test result before boarding, and will be denied boarding if they cannot produce such evidence, unless they claim to be among the exempt categories. </p>  <p>  Passengers who arrive in an Irish Airport or Sea Port without the required evidence will commit an offence and may be subject to prosecution resulting potentially in a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. </p>  <p>  In line with the EU Traffic Light system on arrival, passengers from ECDC red/grey locations and other locations are advised to restrict their movements for 14 days, but may release themselves from the advice to restrict their movements if they have a second negative result from a RT-PCR test taken no less than 5 days post arrival.  This approach to post-arrival testing does not apply to travel from Great Britain, South Africa or South America who are advised to complete the entire 14 day period of self-isolation.</p>  <p>  Arrivals from green and orange countries (as defined by the EU traffic light system) will not be required to restrict their movements on arrival but are to adhere to the local public health guidance.  </p>  <p>  The Government is keeping all measures relating to international travel under review. </p></reply>

The Deputy can access the documents through this link:</p><p>The first report is a financial and economic appraisal (sometimes referred to as a preliminary appraisal) of the proposal which was commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in line with a decision of the previous Government. Following a competitive procurement process, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann selected EY economic consultants to undertake the work and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted a final report to my Department in July 2020. </p><p>Secondly I have also published an independent review of the proposal which was commissioned by my Department. This review was conducted by JASPERS, an agency of the European Union / European Investment Bank, which provides advisory services to Member States (and other public authorities in the EU) and has extensive experience in relation to transport infrastructure proposals in European regions. This independent review noted a number of shortcomings in relation to the proposed re-opening of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3 as presented, in particular around issues such as the need to demonstrate the strategic role of the proposal and how it sat within the broader proposed development of the network.</p><p>In light of the analyses conducted thus far, and in particular with regard to the findings of the independent review conducted by JASPERS as commissioned by my Department, I have requested my Department to prepare terms of reference for a Strategic Rail Review. This Review will consider all relevant issues in relation to inter-urban rail, inter/intra-regional rail and rail connectivity to our international gateways, with the latter considering the role of rail freight.  Interestingly this Strategic Review will be conducted on an-island basis in co-operation with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister Nichola Mallon, MLA, and officials from both our Departments are now developing terms of reference for the Review. </p><p>I understand this may be the first such Review to be conducted on an all-island basis and this will, I believe, allow for a fuller consideration of the potential role of rail and the network required to support that potential than perhaps has been allowed before.</p><p>I am hopeful that the terms of reference will be agreed and the procurement process launched by the end of Q1. The ultimate duration of the Review will be determined by the work programmes submitted in response to that process; this will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.</p></reply>

These requirements can be complex, but it is essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect public health, food safety and product standards as well as the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.</p>  <p>  As regards the performance of Revenue&rsquo;s Customs IT systems, I am advised by Revenue that in most cases, further investigation of specific issues raised with them has revealed that the actual error has been as a result of incorrect data rather than a systems issue. However, there have also been some systems issues and, in such cases, Revenue issued clear and timely communications that enabled affected businesses to continue to move their goods. These notifications are available on the Revenue website but are also automatically issued to businesses that have signed up to receive Revenue eCustoms Notifications. I am assured by Revenue that it was not a systems issue that led to the introduction of a temporary easement measure provided to trade and business in regard to the import safety and security declaration (ENS) declaration.  PBNs are being successfully filed on a daily basis by trade and business.</p>  <p>  While recognising the frustration currently being experienced by business due to these new regulatory requirements, I fully support the Revenue approach of working with individual businesses and with the relevant trade representative bodies to assist them in building the understanding and knowledge of customs formalities and ensuring compliance with same. The aim of which is to ensure that goods movements between Ireland and Great Britain can be as efficient as possible, mindful of the fact that the trading environment changed irrevocably following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.</p></reply>

As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  While I regret the inconvenience caused, I think you will agree with me that this decision was necessary for public health reasons. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when servicers are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.   </p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test service has launched a pilot phase of a new initiative, which offers a Remote Testing service for specific categories of Theory Test (C, D, CD, BMT, TMT, ADI, CPCB, CPCT). Following a review of the pilot phase, I understand the RSA expect the initiative to be extended for car and motorcycles in the future.  As remote testing facilitates additional capacity whilst also enabling the service to continue in the event of further lockdowns, it would be expected this would greatly help in returning the service to normal waiting times.</p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time.

RocDoc provide services at Shannon Airport also. These testing service providers have advised daa and the Shannon Airport Authority concerning headline figures for testing to date, including pre-departures, post-arrivals tests and other non-travel tests.</p>  <p>  There have been a total of 38,400 bookings for Covid-19 tests up to January 3rd across both service providers since testing facilities opened in November at Cork Airport and Dublin Airport. These figures relate to bookings for pre-departures, post-arrivals tests and other non-travel tests. In the region of 2,600 Covid-19 tests have been carried out by the private testing provider located at Shannon Airport up to 12 January 2021. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the estimated figures I have provided do not reflect the full extent of Covid-19 testing for prospective arriving (or departing) passengers, given that many other commercial providers outside of the airport&rsquo;s testing facilities also provide such service.</p></reply>

This temporary 'flight ban' on flights from the UK and South Africa ended 9 of January.

The test must be taken within 72 hours prior to arrival.

Accordingly, no additional extensions to NCT test due dates are under consideration at present.</p>  <p>  Measures have been in place to allow elderly or vulnerable customers have someone else present the car for testing and where this is not possible customers are asked to contact the NCT directly on 01 4135992 to discuss their specific situation.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 health emergency has had a significant impact on the public transport sector. We have been advised by the National Transport Authority (NTA) that since the most recent move to Level 5, they are working closely with transport operators on contingency plans to temporarily reduce public transport services. The decision of the NTA and Dublin Bus to temporarily reduce services was due to three factors:</p>  <p>  1. There has been an increase in staff absences due to Covid-19, thereby reducing the capability to operate the full timetable;</p>  <p>  2. The need to preserve key resources by reducing demand on essential support teams; and</p>  <p>  3. The large reduction in passenger demand since the move to Level 5.</p>  <p>  On Monday 18th of January, with the agreement of the NTA, Dublin Bus implemented these temporary changes and moved to a "Saturday plus" timetable.  This timetable is based on the existing Saturday timetable, with some additional services offered, particularly during the morning peak hours. These changes are similar to the schedule changes that were introduced last Summer. The NTA will continue to engage with Dublin Bus and other operators over the coming weeks to ensure sufficient capacity is in place while current Level 5 restrictions remain in place. </p></reply>

Air services around the world have been reduced significantly, and thousands of aircraft remain grounded. As an island nation, this drop in connectivity has hit Ireland especially hard. While the loss of air services is a concern it is, unfortunately, an unavoidable consequence of the public health measures that are necessary to reduce transmission of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  I am aware of Aer Lingus's plan to begin operating air services from Manchester to the United States through a subsidiary.

A PSC can be used, under legislation, by a number of public bodies including the Road Safety Authority (who provides the National Driver Licence Service). The Department of Social Protection subsequently developed the online identity verification portal known as MyGovID, to enable people who have authenticated their identity and have been issued with a PSC, to verify their identity securely online.  This is the tool that the State has provided to allow individuals to verify their identity in order to services online in a secure and safe manner.</p>  <p>  To renew your driving licence you are required to present photographic ID, evidence of PPSN, evidence of address and evidence of residency entitlement. An applicant must present in person at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) office where the required documentation can be examined and a face to face verification can be made. </p>  <p>  When applying online, the same information is required and  the challenge of verifying a person&rsquo;s identity is more difficult than when someone presents in person at an NDLS office. A verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Service Card (PSC), satisfies this requirement.</p>  <p>  The PSC is a way to streamline the identification process across all public services, making application for all services easier for everyone, and taking away unnecessary burdens from the citizen and the State. The intention is that people will need to go through the cumbersome process of providing documents to prove their identity only once - for the PSC - and then be able to use that card as an ID for a wide range of public services.  More particularly, if people are to have confidence in using public services online, they need to have an verified and authenticated online identity and MyGovID, building on the Public Services Card, gives people that confidence and the means to access services online.</p></reply>

My Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) have taken action throughout the pandemic and none of the measures are restricted in any way by the age of the driver or licence holder. Operators of all ages have benefited from the NTA's waiver of late renewal fees, extension of vehicle age limits and facilitation of insurance suspensions for any operators who decided to temporarily stop working.</p>  <p>  The recent Budget contained a waiver of vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021, a measure which all licence-holders of all ages can benefit from. The Budget also contained a &euro;15 million scrappage scheme for all SPSV operators with older vehicles.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many SPSV operators have benefitted from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), which I understand is not open to individuals over the age of 66.  The PUP and its age criterion, and any other social protection payments to individuals over the age of 66, or any schemes for individuals going into retirement, are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys T.D.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSVs), also known as the Taxi Advisory Committee, has been established under legislation to provide both the Minister and the NTA with an informed view on relevant policy and regulatory matters that represents the balance of interests across the industry and related stakeholders.  As such, it is the appropriate forum for dealing with issues affecting the sector, including the issues identified in the question, and I do not believe that it is either necessary or appropriate to establish another group as suggested by the Deputy.   </p></reply>

As public transport is responsible for less than 5% of our transport emissions, in absolute terms, converting public transport fleets to low carbon alternatives will have a limited impact on national emission reductions. However, greening the public fleet does fulfil a strong leadership and demonstration role as we shift towards a low-carbon economy. To this end, I am committed to continuing to green the public transport fleet, and to making each public transport journey less carbon-intensive. A comprehensive programme of work is already underway, and there is a clear vision to move towards zero emitting vehicles.</p><p>The national bus fleet, which carries the majority of public transport passengers, is already moving to lower emission alternatives. During 2020, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses were ordered, which are plug-in hybrids allowing overnight charging and which have capability of over 2.5 km continuous running in zero emission mode, allowing sections of the routes to operate in this mode.  A number of these vehicles were delivered during December and will enter into service over the coming weeks.  A total of 100 such vehicles should be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2021, with the remaining 180 vehicles to be delivered during quarter 3 and quarter 4 of this year. </p><p>The NTA is currently tendering for the supply of single deck fully electric buses, the first of which will be introduced into town fleets in 2021. In addition, further such vehicles will be assigned to other urban city routes that are capable of being operated with single deck buses. </p><p>In relation to double deck fleet, the number of manufacturers of right-hand drive double deck buses is very limited, which has impacted the level of development of such vehicles.  However, the NTA is satisfied that the available product is now mature enough, and capable of a sufficient range, to allow the purchase of double deck fully electric fleet for some urban city routes.  Accordingly, a tender process has commenced for the purchase of double deck fully electric buses, with the first order expected to be placed later this year, and the first vehicles under that order arriving towards the end of next year.</p><p>In terms of heavy rail, we are expanding electrification through the DART+ programme which will ultimately mean around 70% of journeys in any given year on the rail network will be on electrified services, while in the interim we&rsquo;re continuing to expand rail capacity through the ongoing construction of the National Train Control Centre and the ongoing manufacture of 41 additional carriages for the Greater Dublin Area commuter rail fleet. I also intend to commission a review of the rail network which will consider the potential for high-/higher- speed rail, including of course the potential electrification of the inter-urban network.</p><p>As regards our light rail network,<b></b>we are currently expanding capacity of the Luas Green Line with the ongoing arrival of 26 tram extensions and 8 new additional trams which I expect will have entered service by Q2 2021. We will also look at route options for Luas Cork, Luas Lucan and the preliminary design for Luas Finglas. This year, I also intend to seek Government approval in relation to MetroLink, a new largely underground electrified metro service in Dublin, and likely the largest public investment project in the history of the State. </p><p>Furthermore, in the most recent Budget, I was delighted to announce an EV scrappage scheme to enhance the supports available for taxi and hackney drivers switching to electric vehicles. I hope to see a steady greening of our SPSV fleet over the coming years.<b></b></p><p>Collectively, these measures will see us progressively modernise and lower the emission profile of our public transport fleets, as well as creating an attractive alternative to the private car. As the Deputy is aware, I am fully committed to a shift to public transport and active travel as a means of decreasing transport emissions. We&rsquo;ve seen some great additions to active travel infrastructure and our public realm in recent months, as Local Authorities across the country have put in place emergency measures to support local communities and businesses through our current difficulties. We want to build on these types of initiatives and support them through our commitment of &euro;1.8bn over the lifetime of Government for active travel. This level of investment along with our significant investment in greening public transport will help improve quality of life and reduce emissions and air pollutants from the transport sector.</p></reply>

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness continues to be kept under close review especially in light of the introduction of the Level 5 public health restrictions, and under the legislation there is provision that the scheme may be kept in place until the end of June 2021.  Beyond that, I have always been clear that there would be no cliff-end to the scheme and any further decisions in that regard will be made closer to that time.</p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the provision of mortgage credit, there are certain consumer protection requirements.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on 31 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner.  </p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home. </p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions Revenue confirmed in eBrief 004/2021, which issued on 14<sup>th</sup>January 2021, that the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place. This means that, for the time being: </p><p>- Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period.</p><p>- Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use. </p><p>Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer, etc. </p><p>Where an employee has a car provided by his or her employer and </p><p>1. the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply,</p><p>2. limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken due to the COVID-19 crisis, and</p><p>3. personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the current period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p>Guidance on the above and other COVID-19 related matters can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website*. </p><p>Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic it is not known how long any COVID-19 restrictions will ultimately remain in place. Revenue will however continue to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters (including the provisions relating to BIK on employer-provided vehicles) and if any further measures are considered necessary in the future, updated guidance will be made available by Revenue in relation to same as soon as possible.  </p><p>*https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/covid19/compliance-with-certain-reporting-and-filing-obligations.aspx </p></reply>

Details of the scheme are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed guidelines on the operation of the scheme are available on the Revenue website at: </p><p>  .</p><p>To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, a business must, under the specific terms of the public health regulations, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing its business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that, during the period of restrictions, turnover does not exceed an amount based on 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business).  Where all the eligibility criteria are met, a business will be able to claim support under the scheme based on a percentage of the average weekly turnover in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business).  The support assists eligible businesses in meeting the costs associated with their business premises at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions, they cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as a camping or caravan site or a boat charter business, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS.</p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19 such as a dry cleaning business.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or restrict access to its business premises.</p><p>For seasonal business, as with all other businesses, it is the average weekly turnover in 2019 (or in 2020 in certain cases) that must be considered for the purpose of determining whether the reduction in turnover requirement is met.  Similarly, as for all businesses, it is the average weekly turnover of a seasonal business in 2019 (or 2020 in certain cases) which will determine the amount of support available to the business under the scheme where it meets the eligibility criteria.</p><p>One of the eligibility requirements for CRSS is that a business would carry on its trading activities during the period of restrictions but for the public health regulations requiring the business to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.  Any reduction in turnover of the business during the period of restrictions must relate to those restrictions.  Where a seasonal business would not ordinarily operate during a period of restrictions, for example it operates during summer months only and the restrictions occur in winter months, it will not be able to demonstrate that any reduction in turnover during the period of restrictions relates to the public health restrictions or that it would have operated but for those restrictions.  Therefore, the business would not be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p><p>There may be circumstances, however, where a seasonal business intended to trade outside of its historical trading patterns in order to compensate for reduced trade during its normal season.  If a seasonal business can demonstrate to Revenue, from bookings that had to be cancelled for example, that it intended to trade during a period for which public health restrictions apply, and it meets all of the eligibility criteria, it will be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p><p>Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-20a.374.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012000075#WRJ04700"><p>There is a wide diversity in national mortgage markets, and such mortgage markets have evolved and developed over time having regard to their particular social, economic and other characteristics.  Fixed rate mortgages of long duration are popular in Denmark and in some other countries, but other countries tend to have markets where variable or short term fixed interest rates are more prominent.  Also individual economic and other circumstances will influence the prevailing level of mortgage and interest rates in a country; for example, Denmark is not in the eurozone but it seeks to link the value of its currency with the euro and this will have a particular impact on the official and market interest rates for borrowings in the Danish currency.  On the other hand in relation to Ireland and other eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB) currently engages in a bank funding model which aims to stimulate lending to businesses: i.e. the TLTRO. This scheme operates over a three-year horizon, and offers beneficial borrowing costs to banks who use the ECB funding to issue loans to businesses. This type of scheme is not designed to offer targeting funding over long durations such as in the Danish model.  More generally of course, the ECB is independent in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy for the eurozone area.  Nevertheless, it can be noted that mortgage markets will change and evolve over time and in Ireland there has been an increase in the market for 1-5 year mortgage interest rate fixations over the past number of years. </p>  <p>  In relation to the relative merits of fixed versus variable rate mortgage types, the Central Bank of Ireland has undertaken some research on this issue and it suggests that a move towards longer-dated fixation periods, such as those seen in Denmark or the USA, would require careful consideration.  The Government is aware of this and, as the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government is committed to looking at the issue of long term fixed rate mortgages. </p>  <p>  There are benefits to long-duration fixed-rate mortgages. They provide borrowers with mortgage repayment certainty which aids financial planning. In a low-interest rate environment, they also increase borrower resilience by locking in cheaper borrowing costs, insulating borrowers from future rate increases. </p>  <p>  On the other hand long-term fixed rate mortgages also come with significant risks, the most important of which as suggested by the Central Bank relates to bank profitability. When banks issue long-term fixed rate loans, they leave themselves exposed to interest rate risk: if their funding costs rise during the duration of the loan&rsquo;s lifetime, their profitability will decrease. There are a number of strategies available to manage this interest rate risk. Currently, it appears that Irish banks are using private market solutions (hedging, swap markets) to manage the interest rate risk on their shorter-duration interest rate fixations.</p>  <p>  However, it is also not clear that one type of mortgage market (or mortgage interest rate type) will automatically deliver lower interest rates than another type; rather it is likely that more fundamental market factors, such as the performance of the market, mortgage funding costs, level of mortgage default, the ease and cost of access to the security if necessary consequent upon default, regulatory requirements, competition and profitability etc. will also have a significant influence on prevailing mortgage variable and fixed interest rates.  In this context the Central Bank has suggested that, while acknowledging that the setting of their mortgage and other lending rates are commercial matters for individual lenders, there are a range of factors and costs which must be covered by the mortgage interest rate which would imply that a zero per cent interest rate as seen in Denmark would not be likely or appropriate in the Irish setting.  Some of these factors are: </p>  <p>  - Higher Capital Requirements: The more risky a bank&rsquo;s assets are, the higher a bank&rsquo;s capital requirement. This is to ensure that banks can sustain losses, when they occur, without risking the bank&rsquo;s survival.  Irish retail banks&rsquo; mortgage modelled Risk Weighted Assets are 1.5-2.5 times the EU average.  This results primarily from the relatively high historic credit risk experience in Ireland, the longer workout process and uncertainty in relation to collateral realisation and the relatively elevated levels of NPLs and restructured loans in Irish banks. These higher capital requirements increase the cost of lending for banks, but now leave them in a more resilient position. </p>  <p>  - NPL&rsquo;s and restructured loans: are higher for Irish banks than most other European peers. Provisions/losses and capital requirements are higher for these loans, reflecting their higher risk. This results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks.</p>  <p>  - Higher cost-to-income: growing cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years. Since 2017, the Irish banking sector, on average, is now performing worse on a cost-to-income basis relative to its European counterparts. </p>  <p>  - Competition: In comparison to other jurisdictions such as the UK, there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market. Resulting from limited competition and low levels of switching, pricing will tend to be higher. Nevertheless, even within the current Irish market, consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. A recent study by the Central Bank estimates that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Irish mortgages can have different characteristics from those offered by other EU banks making direct comparison of headline mortgage rates inconsistent. For example, many Irish banks include cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. In addition, Irish mortgages are not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, which can result in lower EU headline rates.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p>  <p>  Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming he or she meets various conditions specified in the section, including that he or she is a first-time purchaser and that he or she has completed a tax return form and paid any outstanding balance for each of the four tax years prior to making the application. </p>  <p>  In relation to the tax due (if any) on amounts received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) or Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), employees will be given the opportunity to fully or partially pay any income tax liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount. Otherwise, Revenue will collect the liability, interest free, by reducing the employees tax credits over 4 years to minimise any hardship. The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p>  <p>  Where an underpayment of tax arises for the year 2020 as a result of amounts received under the TWSS or PUP, Revenue advise me that they will allow a claim for HTB relief for the amount of income tax paid for 2020 and will not require the outstanding tax liability to be paid in advance where the underpayment of tax is due to be collected from 2022 by reducing the claimant&rsquo;s tax credits. This will only apply where all other conditions of the HTB scheme are satisfied.</p></reply>

These requirements can be complex, but it is essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect public health, food safety and product standards as well as the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new rules and procedures that are now in place, including the Ready for Customs Grant scheme and the Clear Customs training programme.  Officials and State Agencies have also been providing support and assistance on a 24/7 basis when practical difficulties with the new rules and procedures arise.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that some businesses have found that it has taken longer to move goods through our ports, but it is important to note that a significant number of businesses have successfully made the transition to the new trading environment. These businesses are successfully submitting Customs declarations and receiving the associated Master Reference Numbers (MRNs) and are using these MRNs to create and populate the Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN). In recent days, more than 70% of goods being imported through Dublin Port, for example, are being green routed on arrival meaning they can leave the port without the need for additional interaction with Customs or other State agencies.  </p>  <p>  As regards the performance of Revenue&rsquo;s Customs IT systems, I am advised by Revenue that in most cases, further investigation of specific issues raised with them has revealed that the actual error has been as a result of incorrect data rather than a systems issue. However, there have also been some systems issues and, in such cases, Revenue issued clear and timely communications that enabled affected businesses to continue to move their goods. These notifications are available on the Revenue website but are also automatically issued to businesses that have signed up to receive Revenue eCustoms Notifications. I am assured by Revenue that it was not a systems issue that led to the introduction of a temporary easement measure provided to trade and business in regard to the import safety and security declaration (ENS) declaration.  PBNs are being successfully filed on a daily basis by trade and business. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied based on the examination of the issues undertaken by Revenue and the assurance provided to me by Revenue that the customs IT systems are functioning well and are robust and resilient. I do, of course, fully appreciate the difficulties that arise for business when even short-term issues impact on business and the efficiency with which they can move goods. I fully support the Revenue approach of working with individual businesses and with the relevant trade representative bodies to assist them in building the understanding and knowledge of customs formalities and ensuring compliance with same so that goods movements between Ireland and Great Britain can be as efficient as possible, mindful of the fact that the trading environment changed irrevocably following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.</p></reply>

Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The main objective being that impacted borrowers are provided with the appropriate supports by their lenders.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers &ndash; in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code &ndash; to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to repaying their debt.  In particular, the CCMA sets out the process that entities must follow when a borrower is in or facing difficulties on a primary home mortgage.  </p>  <p>  This Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the CCMA comprises four steps which are:-</p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution.</p>  <p>  The CCMA must be complied with as a matter of law and the Central Bank has the power to take enforcement action against any regulated entity who does not act in compliance with the CCMA. Under Provision 38 of the CCMA, it is acceptable to put in place temporary alternative repayment arrangements prior to completion of the full assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s Standard Financial Statement (SFS), where a delay will further exacerbate borrower&rsquo;s arrears or pre-arrears situation.</p>  <p>  It is in the best long term interest of borrowers and lenders that the most appropriate and suitable arrangement is put in place in context of a particular situation, and this can only be done where there is engagement between the borrower and lender. Payment breaks continue to be available as part of a suite of measures lenders offer to customers facing difficulties and the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders providing payment breaks so long as they are appropriate in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.  However, if following engagement it is concluded that another solution is better, then it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to adopt that better option as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As indicated, the Central Bank is continuing to engage on this matter and it recently indicated that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. </p></reply>

In section 208, the term &ldquo;charity&rdquo; means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only. Essentially, therefore, any such body that qualifies for exemption from income tax under section 208 also qualifies for exemption from capital gains tax. Consequently, this means that, in general, gains on disposals of land by religious orders will be exempt from capital gains tax. </p>  <p>  As with all taxes, CGT is subject to ongoing review, which involves the consideration and assessment of the rate of CGT and the relevant reliefs and exemptions from CGT. CGT policy and legislation is reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process, and is considered in the wider tax policy context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-20a.416.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012000077#WRL00500"><p>The Living City Initiative (LCI) was provided for in Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5th May 2015. In my Budget 2020 speech, I announced that the LCI would be extended from 5 May 2020 to 31 December 2022. LCI is designed as a tax-based scheme which is demand led. As such, it is not subject to an annual cost ceiling and the question of increasing its funding annually by 50% does not arise.</p><p>LCI is specifically aimed at the regeneration of the historic inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. The scheme provides income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in refurbishing/converting qualifying buildings which are located within pre-determined 'Special Regeneration Areas' (SRAs). </p><p>There are three types of relief available:</p><p>- Owner-occupier residential relief;</p><p>- Rented residential relief; and</p><p>- Commercial/Retail relief. </p><p>In 2016 officials from my Department reviewed the measure in consultation with the relevant councils and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective.</p><p>The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who may now claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes.  In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative has been removed. The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, has also been amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000.</p><p>The aim of the above changes is to improve the effectiveness of the scheme. Once it is clear that this have been achieved, it will then be possible to consider if and how the initiative might be extended further, for example to other locations. Unless the underpinning scheme is made more effective, extension of eligibility for it to other locations is likely to be largely ineffective.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the available information in respect of the cost of the Living City Initiative is published on the Revenue website at link; </p><p>for all years up to 2018. The relevant row in the table is titled &lsquo;Living City&rsquo;. The following table outlines the cost/uptake for all 3 elements combined of the scheme nationally  between 2013 and 2018 (the most recent year for which data are available). <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of claimants</th>       <th>Max Tax Cost (&euro;M)*</th>       <th>Amount claimed (&euro;M)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>0.1</td>       <td>0.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>N/A</td>       <td>0.1</td>       <td>0.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>N/A</td>       <td>0.05</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr> </table> *assumed at 40% for IT and 12.5% for CT.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition to the conditions laid down in section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA), including that the property is occupied as the sole or main residence of a first time purchaser, section 477C(1) defines a &lsquo;qualifying residence&rsquo;.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling.  Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for HTB. The previous dwelling must have been demolished and replaced as opposed to being extended/refurbished. In the circumstances where a house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, based on the information outlined by the Deputy, it appears that, in this case, the applicants are renovating an old house, which would not be considered as &ldquo;new&rdquo; for the purposes of the HTB scheme and, accordingly, does not qualify for HTB.</p>  <p>  The availability of direct expenditure measures, including grants, for first time buyers is not a matter that would fall within my direct remit.</p></reply>

All credit institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a shareholding, are independent commercial entities. Interest rates on deposit accounts are a commercial matter for the boards and management of individual banks. Notwithstanding this, I am not aware of any Irish retail banks charging retail depositors negative interest rates.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), through State Savings products, offers a wide range of savings products to the general public, including prize bonds and fixed rate savings bonds/certificates. Both short term and long term fixed rate products are offered, with maturities from 3 to 10 years.</p>  <p>  The interest rates on offer are competitive and provide good value for the holders of State Savings products. The return for the saver rewards those who hold products to maturity. However, early redemption is also possible. The NTMA keeps these products under review and have recently informed me that they continue to see strong flows into these products.</p>  <p>  Credit unions have experienced savings inflows over recent years, which have outpaced loan demand from their members. The savings which a credit union does not lend to its members must be invested while ensuring that such investments do not result in undue risk. At the same time, due to low/negative investment returns, reflective of the current low interest rate environment, credit unions may decide to limit the amount of savings to be invested or in some cases, consider the introduction of fees.</p>  <p>  This is a commercial decision for individual credit unions where they are of the view that this will best support the ongoing prudent operation of their credit union for their members.</p></reply>

However, I can advise that it is a condition of the majority of public service occupational pension schemes, including the HSE scheme, that the member make a pension contribution towards the cost of retirement benefits for the full period of his or her scheme membership. That continues to be the case even if the member serves in excess of 40 years, which in the standard pre-existing pension schemes (i.e. all the standard schemes excluding the Single Public Service Pension Scheme), is the maximum period of pensionable service that is allowed in the calculation of pension benefits. </p>  <p>  I should point out that the public service pre-existing pension schemes are defined benefit schemes, which means that benefits are based on a defined calculation formula (e.g. 1/80th and 3/80ths of final pensionable remuneration for retirement pension and lump sum, respectively, for public servants in modified PRSI class) rather than on the contributions made by or on behalf of the individual.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the value of superannuation benefits for the individual continues to increase beyond the 40 year threshold as increments, promotion or pay increases (occurring after 40 years&rsquo; service) are reflected in the pension and superannuation lump sum ultimately payable on retirement.</p>  <p>  In respect of public service spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s contributory pension schemes, which provide dependants&rsquo; benefits in case of the death of the member either during service or following retirement, there is provision for a refund of member contributions where reckonable service is given in excess of 40 years &ndash; such refunds relate to contributions made in the earlier part of one&rsquo;s career.</p></reply>

The intention of these reforms is to increase transparency around the budgetary process and to facilitate meaningful dialogue around key elements of the Budget and on what is being achieved with public funds.</p><p>Central to these reforms is the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework. This refers to an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities throughout the year, rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day. An important element of this is the publication of a range of documents at key points in the year to enhance engagement on relevant budgetary issues.  </p><p>Improving and supporting the evaluation capacity within Government Departments has also formed an important part of the reform programme. Supported by the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, this has led to the development of a number of additional processes and reports to support the budgetary framework. This includes:</p><p><b>Performance Budgeting</b>- A key objective of the Performance Budgeting Initiative is to shift the focus away from the quantum of spend and towards outputs and impacts. The Public Service Performance Report presents performance information in an accessible manner and aims to facilitate discussion around what is being delivered with public funds and how this impacts the citizen. </p><p><b>Equality Budgeting</b>&ndash; Equality budgeting involves providing greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and/or ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process. An OECD &quot;Policy Scan&quot; Report on Equality Budgeting was completed and published in 2019, setting out a number of ambitious objectives to progress this aspect of the budgetary reform agenda, with work being progressed in implementing the recommendations set out in the Report.</p><p><b>Spending Review</b>- This process aims to place evidence at the heart of policy making, by systematically examining existing spending programmes with a view to assessing their efficiency and effectiveness, as well as overall quality in programme design and delivery. This approach can support the targeting and considered allocation of funding in line with policy priorities. </p><p>A key objective of these reforms is to support sustainable growth in public expenditure while delivering improvements in public services. Pre-Covid, the average annual growth rate in spending on day-to-day services over the five year period 2015 to 2020 was projected at 4%, with the emphasis over this period being on catch-up growth in capital spending and sustainable growth in current spending targeted at key frontline services. This approach delivered a positive fiscal position as we entered the crisis caused by the pandemic, with a General Government surplus of 0.5% of GDP being recorded in 2019.</p><p>Looking forward, the overall Budgetary Strategy for 2021 focuses on prioritising crisis management measures to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit while continuing to provide for sustainable increases in day-to-day spending on core expenditure programmes and increased levels of capital investment. My Department will continue to engage with other Departments over the course of the year in respect of the management of expenditure within the agreed expenditure allocations set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021 published in December last year. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process, including an enhanced focus across Government on issues of performance and contributing to national well-being. In implementing further reforms, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed. Adopting this approach will support stronger dialogue on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.</p></reply>

Recent OPS2020 developments that will support enhanced service delivery include development of a procurement framework for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to enable all public service bodies to draw down RPA services from an agreed supplier, saving significant time and money; establishment of a Public Service Innovation Fund to encourage innovation in public bodies and promote collaboration as well as new and better approaches to service delivery; publication of Making Innovation Real, the Public Service Innovation Strategy ; and publication of OPS2020 Excellence in Customer Service Case Studies  , 25 case studies on customer service best practice - see ops2020.gov.ie </p><p>My Department is currently preparing the next Public Service Reform and Innovation Programme - Our Public Service 2030 (OPS2030)- and will be consulting with PSOs, Government stakeholders and citizens on the draft proposal in the coming months. The vision and strategy underpinning OPS2030 will focus on large-scale ambitious transformation to support the delivery of better public services - embedding the key gains that have already been made in digitalisation, citizen engagement, programme management, and a growing culture of innovation. OPS2030 will incorporate key Programme for Government commitments, including the remote working commitment and relevant national policy strategies, such as the forthcoming <i>Public Service Digital Strategy</i>. </p><p>My Department is committed to exploring the possibility of including service provision and assisted digital functionality for the public in regional hubs, through the Public Service Innovation Strategy. This will require stakeholder engagement with officials from appropriate Departments and PSOs and will need to align with the ambitions articulated in the <i>Making Remote Work</i>strategy, recently published by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.</p><p>An important focus on OPS2030 will continue to be on enhanced service delivery and better outcomes for our public. The Deputy should note that the Programme Management and Innovation office of the Local Government Management Agency supports the delivery of innovation and continuous improvement across the local government sector.</p><p>Let me assure the Deputy that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention that citizens in Kildare, along with those throughout Ireland, will continue to see significant benefits in the delivery of public services from the next stage of its public service reform programme.  </p></reply>

Responsibility for the management and delivery of the individual investment projects, within the allocations agreed under the NDP, rests with the individual sponsoring Department in each case. </p>  <p>  Under the umbrella of Project Ireland 2040, the Government has allocated capital funding behind the national priorities set out in the National Planning Framework (NPF). The three Regional Assemblies are responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, by formulating Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The key role in leading development at county level rests with the relevant local authority in the first instance.</p>  <p>  A series of regional reports have been published on the Project Ireland 2040 website, outlining the country-wide reach and impact of the public infrastructural investments under the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework. The report on the Mid-East region, which will be of particular interest to the Deputy, details the specific regional projects and programmes now being planned and delivered in that area. </p>  <p>  I might also add that my Department publishes a major capital projects tracker, which sets out details of the key projects and programmes being implemented under the NDP, including the location of the projects where possible.  The Tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to Kildare.  While it does not provide an exhaustive list of all capital expenditure, the list of projects serves to highlight the diverse range of infrastructural demands competing for the resources of the State.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the NDP. The review being conducted will not be considering the merit of individual projects or sectoral policy strategies as this is a matter for individual Departments and Agencies. As part of the NDP review process, my Department is also running a stakeholder engagement process and would invite stakeholders such as County Councils to submit their views on what infrastructure projects should be prioritised in the coming 10 years.  Details of the consultation process are set out on the website www.gov.ie/2040. </p></reply>

Governance arrangements have been established to  foster collaboration and cooperation across the OGP and the main sectors of Health, Local Government, Education and Defence. Through the development of a suite of centralised arrangements, the Government&rsquo;s purchasing power has been leveraged by speaking to the market with &lsquo;one voice&rsquo;. Procurement Reform has delivered a programme of policy supports for SMEs, and has built an awareness in industry regarding the opportunities arising from public procurement.</p>  <p>  The OGP has been developing proposals on the refinement of the procurement reform programme following consultation with our colleagues across Government and industry.  These will enhance public procurement, building on the progress to date, with a more strategic focus and increase emphasis on sustainability, social responsibility, SME access, innovation, digitalisation and professionalisation.</p>  <p>  The Government has set out a number of commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to public procurement including evaluating and managing the environmental, economic and social impacts of procurement strategies within the state, developing and implementing a sustainable procurement policy and tasking the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to update all procurement frameworks in line with green procurement practice.</p>  <p>  These commitments enhance work already underway by the OGP to promote wider policy considerations including environmental and social in public procurement. Strategic spending can play a key role in responding to societal, environmental and economic challenges. The range of policies is broad and includes SME access, green public procurement and environmental sustainability, disability access, training for young or disadvantaged people. </p>  <p>  Implementation of these policies will ensure strong value-for-money for the taxpayer, minimise the environmental impact and optimise the community benefit of products and services procured, support innovation in supply markets to increase the availability and effectiveness of sustainable solutions and encourage suppliers to adopt practices that minimise their environmental impact and deliver community benefit.</p></reply>

The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to manage this expenditure at a sustainable level, which allows for the recruitment and retention of appropriately skilled staff.</p>  <p>  Important measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Government Minister and Department. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. </p>  <p>  There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  All departments, when managing pay issues, must fully adhere to Government pay policy, which is managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Circulars issued by this Department in relation to pay policy inform Departments of any changes in respect of pay and conditions and must be implemented in full.</p>  <p>  Pay and conditions of public servants are set by collective bargaining agreements negotiated between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and union representatives. The current agreement, "Building Momentum": A New Public Service Agreement, 2021 - 2022, sets out the terms and conditions for public service pay over the next two years. This is an extension of the framework of public service agreements, including the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2018 - 2020, which expired on 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  The range of approaches set out above are key elements in ensuring that public service pay expenditure is managed in a sustainable way.</p></reply>

With this in mind, Departmental circulars relating to inter-authority movement issued in 2017 and 2019, with the aim of facilitating movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority.</p>  <p>  Given that the flexibility afforded by inter-authority movement facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and supports the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests. </p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), is currently analysing the submissions received. </p><p>Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. The Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The consultation period was completed on 21 December 2020 and gave rise to no further issues.</p><p>Further to the SEA screening process, I issued the updated <i>Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, Guidelines for Planning Authorities (December 2020)</i>, as Ministerial guidance under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) on 23 December 2020. </p><p>The updated apartment guidelines now include a Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) for a presumption against granting planning permission for co-living/shared accommodation development, and replace the previous, 2018 version of the guidelines.

Any planning applications and consequent appeals, or SHD applications made after the date of publication of the updated guidelines, will be subject to the updated guidelines.</p><p>The letter I issued to planning authorities on 23 December 2020 was accompanied by the updated technical guidance, <i>Design Standards for New Apartments: Guidelines for Planning Authorities (December 2020)</i>and are available on the website at the following link:  </p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.</p>  <p>  While my Department is not operationally responsible for the carrying out of such works, it provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). </p>  <p>  The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority RPS. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public.  </p>  <p>  Last year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country benefited from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under BHIS and HSF. An extra &euro;1m in funding was secured for built heritage projects under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020, which aims to offset some of the effects of Covid-19. This funding supplemented 28 BHIS and HSF projects and supported 12 new ones, in addition to capital works by the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust.</p>  <p>  I recently launched the BHIS and HSF for 2021, with a combined allocation of &euro;6m, an increase of nearly 40% over 2020. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of each local authority. In light of delays arising as a result of current Level 5 restrictions, I have extended the deadline for applications from Local Authorities to the Department to Friday 12 March. Individual owners should check with the relevant Local Authority regarding local deadlines. </p>  <p>  Last year I also introduced the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) under which &euro;1.4m was allocated for conservation and other works at our national monuments. A total of 69 CMF projects nationally were supported and I hope shortly to announce a continuance of the scheme for 2021.</p></reply>

This will also see the first affordable homes delivered by local authorities under the scheme delivered in 2021.</p><p>In December 2020, the Government approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 which will provide a legislative basis for both of these schemes.  Once enacted, the Bill will deliver on key commitments in the Programme for Government.  The detailed design of these schemes is currently ongoing and will be finalised following engagement with the range of key stakeholders.</p><p>It is intended that these schemes will be targeted at first-time buyers who are seeking to buy a new home, but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time.  The equity support provided will help them secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home that is suitable to meet their needs. </p><p>It is my intention to launch both of these schemes by mid-year.</p></reply>

No. 701 of 2020) which will continue in operation until 31 January 2021. These Regulations include "statutory planning system activities, insofar as they cannot be carried out remotely" as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; specified at paragraph 14, Part 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations concerning public administration, emergency services and defence.  This enables the staff of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to travel to and from their offices as may be required for the performance of their statutory functions.  It also enables such staff to perform related statutory functions including site visits and inspections as well as enforcement activity subject to public health and social distancing requirements. </p>  <p>  In addition, for the purpose of facilitating continued public participation in the planning process during the Level 5 restrictions, regulation 4(1) of the above Regulations provides that an applicable person shall not leave his or her place of residence without reasonable excuse.  Regulation 4(2) in this regard provides that such reasonable excuse includes to attend the offices of a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to engage in a statutory planning process (including making or inspecting a planning application or appeal, making an observation or submission or participating in a Development Plan process) or inspect a site notice. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should also be noted in this context that planning authorities are required under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 38) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 180 of 2020) to upload planning applications and related documentation onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt or, where exceptional circumstances exist, as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>  <p>  These measures enable members of the public to view documentation online and at planning offices and facilitate planning applications, appeals or other submissions to be made during the Level 5 restrictions. These arrangements may include provision for attendance by appointment so that public health and social distancing requirements can be observed by both staff and customers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above measures, section 5 of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 gives the Government the option, at the request of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to make &lsquo;emergency period&rsquo; orders, during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, which orders could extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts. The objective of this temporary contingency measure is to ensure that the integrity of the planning regime, especially its public participation elements, and certain decision making and enforcement systems of the building control regime, are not compromised. </p>  <p>  While it is not intended to request the Government to make such an emergency period order at this time, having regard to the other measures in place, my Department in consultation with the County and City Management Association continues to monitor the ongoing situation in planning authorities across the country and is keeping the situation under review.</p></reply>

Local authority mortgage protection insurance is charged at the rate of 0.555%, this rate does not vary between local authorities.</p>  <p>  It is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme, which is a group policy. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. </p>  <p>  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market. The level of coverage/benefits provided under the alternative MPI should be similar to that available under the Local Authority Group MPI.</p>  <p>  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure consistency of treatment for all applicants.</p>  <p>  The scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts. This is to ensure that the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured for local authority borrowers over the entire life of their mortgages.</p>  <p>  The most recent public procurement competition for the provision and administration of this MPI scheme was conducted by the Office of Government Procurement. The contract resulting from this open tender competition came into effect from 1 January 2017 and is due to expire on 31 December 2021.</p></reply>

CIRI was established on a voluntary basis in 2014 and 798 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register. The voluntary register can be viewed online at the following link:  </p><p>Government approved the General Scheme of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing on 30 May 2017 which was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The General Scheme, which was published in 2017, is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>The main objective of the proposed legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p><p>The Bill will also allow for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds and provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation.  The General Scheme of the Bill also provides that when the register is operating on a statutory basis, that the Admissions and Appeals Board shall publish information in relation to sanctions of registered members as it thinks fit and that CIRI shall also prepare an annual report of its proceedings under the Act. As the register is currently a voluntary register the publication of reports at this time is a matter for CIRI.</p><p>When established on a statutory basis it is proposed that the operation of CIRI will be vested in the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in the same way that statutory registration of Architects was vested in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), pursuant to the Building Control Act 2007. My Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in Q1 of this year, following which it will be introduced in the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes and the increased build targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land.</p>  <p>  In progressing this major construction programme it is important to pursue timely delivery while also ensuring value for money in terms of Exchequer funding. In this regard, social housing projects, like all publicly-funded construction projects, must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Public Spending Code and Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability.</p>  <p>  My Department, working with local authorities has sought to streamline the four-stage approval process for social housing and to introduce other measures to increase the pace of delivery. As a result of this work a pre-construction programme of 59 weeks was agreed, which includes design, Part 8 approval, detailed design, preparation of tender documentation, issuing tenders and tender reports. The 59-weeks includes 15 weeks for the requisite Department approvals, which occur in parallel with local authority activities where possible. Local authorities have been able to reduce this pre-construction timeline further using design and build frameworks. Off-site construction has also been used to reduce local authority construction timelines.</p>  <p>  In September 2020 I increased the threshold for the Single-Stage Approval Process for local authority Social Housing Capital Construction Projects from &euro;2m to &euro;6m, to give further autonomy to local authorities to progress projects, under that Process which reduces  the number of approvals sought from my Department from four to one. There are 21 projects (50 units) currently going through the single stage approval process. To date 35 projects (114 units) are on site or have completed having used the single stage process.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on all social housing delivery activity. This is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/.</p>  <p>  This data is complete to the end of Q3 2020. Data for Quarter 4 2020 is currently being complied and will be published when available. </p></reply>

It contains commercially sensitive information in relation to the methodology used for costing public sector projects and for the pricing of risks by public sector bodies. In accordance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines (Guidelines for the use of Public Private Partnerships), the final PSB, or any elements thereof, is not made public during the tendering process nor where it is intended to procure further similar projects in the near future (e.g. subsequent project bundles as part of an ongoing PPP programme).</p>  <p>  Construction is currently continuing on the remaining homes from Bundles 1 and 2 of the PPP programme, and the remaining homes across both bundles scheduled for completion later this year. My Department and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) are currently working with the relevant Local Authorities to progress the third bundle of sites in this PPP programme. The NDFA, in its role as procuring authority and financial advisor, and Dublin City Council, as lead local authority and Sponsoring Agency, have commenced the design phase and planning for the tender process in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  It is planned that tenders will be invited from PPP consortia towards the end of this year.</p>  <p>  As Bundle 3 will follow the same structure as Bundles 1 and 2 and given the potential impact on value for money for the State, it is not appropriate to release the PSB for Bundle 1 at this time. However, and in accordance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines, once an appropriate period of time has elapsed and the commercial sensitivity of the information on the project is no longer an issue (having regard also to any other similar PPP projects which may be in pre-procurement), the PSB should be made public. My Department will follow these guidelines in relation to the social housing PPP programme.</p></reply>

The adaptation of existing as well as the design of new buildings will, of course, be critical to meet the targets set by the Climate Action Plan. It is my intention that a new National Policy on Architecture will play an integral part in implementing our vision for the future providing policy actions that will encourage best quality in researching, understanding, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environment assets as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces.</p>  <p>  My Department, supported by a steering committee including officials from the Office of Public Works, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the City and County Architects Association, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the schools of architecture and the Irish Architecture Foundation, undertook a public consultation process in 2020 allowing the opportunity for all communities, stakeholders and citizens to have their say on the proposed new Policy. </p>  <p>  The consultation phase considered the main ways in which architecture and our built environment affect society, our health and well-being and our ability to prosper. These include climate adaptation and mitigation and sustainable development, the benefits for everyone of obtaining high quality in the built environment, the protection and reuse of our built heritage, ways we can demonstrate built environment leadership and the need to foster education about our built environment.  As well as receiving online and written submissions and engaging on social media my Department held a series of workshops and meetings, including virtual workshops in line with public health restrictions, to allow wide-ranging involvement in the drafting of the new policy, as well as consideration of the effect of Covid-19 on our built environment. </p>  <p>  The new Policy will be informed by the feedback from the consultation phase, with over 150 submissions received, as well as by a review of the previous Government Policy on Architecture and our involvement in a European Commission working group on high quality architecture and built environment. A report based on analysis of the consultation phase is to be completed this month. It is my intention that a draft policy will then be circulated to key stakeholders, including the Deputy, and Government Departments prior to finalisation.</p></reply>

The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021, with annual targets for each local authority. The Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities. A copy of the National Implementation Plan is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/b19937-housing-first-national-implementation-plan-2018-2021. Contracts for the delivery of services have been put in place in each of the nine regions responsible for the delivery of homeless services with tenancies now in place in every region.</p>  <p>  The regional targets contained in the Plan were agreed by local authorities based on a review of homelessness data and a national survey of the support needs of homeless individuals conducted with service providers. In this regard, it is important to note that the majority of individuals in emergency accommodation do not require the level of supports provided by Housing First.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to an expansion of the Housing First targets.  Research is being undertaken by the Housing Agency to carry out an assessment of need for the supports provided by Housing First which is being used to inform the expansion of the Programme.  I expect this work to be complete and to be in a position to announce an expansion of the Programme during the first half of 2021.</p></reply>

Housing Agency recommendations are then considered by the Credit Committee in each local authority, which issues loan approvals.  </p><p>I understand that the Housing Agency has assessed 7,367 valid applications from February 2018 to end December 2020.  Of these, it recommended 3,640 applications for approval and 3,727 applications be declined.</p><p>The most common reasons for a recommendation to decline are as follows &ndash;</p><p>-  Repayment Capacity Not Demonstrated </p><p>-  Net Income Ratio Outside of Policy </p><p>-  Unsatisfactory Savings Record </p><p>-  Unsatisfactory ICB Report </p><p>-  Outside Credit Policy </p><p>-  Income Sustainability Not Evident </p><p>-  Unsatisfactory Financial Management </p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the Scheme, in order to ensure consistency of treatment for all applicants.  </p><p>Loan applicants who are dissatisfied with a loan application decision of a local authority Credit Committee may appeal that decision to the local authority.  Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority. </p><p>In general terms, there is no indication that the proportion of loans recommended for decline by the Housing Agency is excessive. A review of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) noted that the decision regarding credit assessment by the Housing Agency were &quot;in line with the rejection rate data the ESRI collected as part of its Economic Sentiment Monitor for renter households who applied for a mortgage&quot;. While there are some differences in the data used in the comparison, this finding would not support the view that the rejection rate is excessive.</p><p>The ESRI report can be found at www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/RS104_4.pdf.</p></reply>

In effect, the publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 with the Commission required to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to the chairman of the D&aacute;il within three months of publication of final census results.  The next review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will commence following the publication of preliminary census results following the Census of Population proposed for April 2022.  The timing for the publication of both preliminary census results and final census results are a matter for the Central Statistics Office but typically take place within 3 months and 12 months respectively of the holding of the census.</p>  <p>  Census data also informs the preparation of terms of reference for any review of local electoral areas to be undertaken and provides a basis for the work of any Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee(s) which may be established by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage from time to time.  Section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001 empowers the Minister to divide a local authority area into local electoral areas and to amend those areas.  However, in advance of deciding to make an order under section 23 of the Act, the Minister must, in accordance with section 32(2) of the Local Government Act 1991, request a boundary committee to make a report having regard to such matters as may be specified by the Minister.  The Minister must publish the report of the boundary committee and must have regard to the report of that committee when deciding to make an order in relation to the revision of local electoral area boundaries.  Ultimately, the timeframe for the making of the report will be determined by the boundary committee's terms of reference.</p>  <p>  On 15 December 2020, the Government approved the drafting of an Electoral Reform Bill and the circulation of the Bill's general scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative consideration.  The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future relating to the establishment of a statutory Electoral Commission, the modernisation of the electoral registration process and the regulation of online political advertising during election periods.  It also includes proposals aimed at assisting with the holding of electoral events where Covid-19 restrictions are in place.  The general scheme was circulated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee last week and has been published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020/.  </p>  <p>  The Electoral Commission will be independent of Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas.  Following its establishment, which is envisaged by the end of this year, it will take on several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by Constituency Commissions and Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees.</p></reply>

This includes fulfilling Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under a range of international agreements and conventions on nature. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), underpins much of global biodiversity policy and its 15th Conference of the Parties is due to take place later this year, having been delayed due to the Covid pandemic from its original dates in November 2020.</p>  <p>  The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, launched by the European Commission in May 2020, proposes that by 2030, member states legally protect at least 30% of the EU&rsquo;s land and marine areas, and that 10% (or one-third of the protected areas) would be strictly protected. This is an overall EU target and discussions around how this will be achieved are still ongoing; fair and transparent burden-sharing among member states is a crucial consideration in discussions around implementation of the Strategy at national level. Nonetheless, the EU Strategy will form the basis of the positions to be adopted by the EU and its Member States at COP15.</p>  <p>  The High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People is an intergovernmental group co-chaired by Costa Rica and France, and the United Kingdom as Ocean co-chair to mobilise political will for nature and biodiversity. Membership of the HAC currently includes 50 governments across Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. This includes Ireland following my announcement of our intention to support the HAC last Monday, 11 January. The aim of the Coalition is to help achieve an ambitious global deal for nature and people, at COP15, that can halt the accelerating loss of biodiversity and protect vital ecosystems that safeguard human health and economic security. A key element of such a deal is to protect at least 30% of the planet&rsquo;s land and ocean by 2030, known as the "30x30 target".</p>  <p>  The increased percentage of designated land for protected areas is crucial to the EU Biodiversity Strategy but will require significant buy-in across the EU from agriculture and landowners. This will be one of the key challenges of implementing the Strategy. The Commission and member states will agree on criteria and guidance for identifying and designating additional areas, as well as further information on definition of protection, later this year. Member states will be obliged to demonstrate significant progress in designating the required new protected areas and integrating ecological corridors by end 2023; on this basis the Commission will assess in 2024 whether new EU legislation or other further actions should be proposed.</p>  <p>  Ireland is at the early stages of developing a network of marine protected areas (that will include SACs and SPAs designated under the Nature Directives). In addition, NPWS and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are cooperating on exploring the overlaps of the Biodiversity Strategy with the EU "Farm to Fork" policy in agriculture; and more generally, examining the resources and funding which will be needed for restoration, and with regard to implications for farming, forestry, fisheries and the commercial activities associated with implementation of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The EU Strategy also calls for the updating of National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plans (NBAP) in 2021. Ireland has carried out an interim review of its current NBAP and the process of developing a new NBAP will get underway this year. The outcome of the COP15 and the agreement of a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, along with the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and the existing national policy and legislative framework for biodiversity and nature, will underpin the objectives, targets and actions of an ambitious and transformative National Biodiversity Action Plan to carry on the important work that is already underway across government in implementing the current NBAP which runs from 2017 to 2021.</p></reply>

Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland was created to achieve the shared goal of further developing quality experiences at our National Parks and Nature Reserves. One major output from the Department's Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was a Masterplan for the six National Parks and Nature Reserves. This provides a high level and integrated blueprint for the NPWS to invest in and better manage the Parks for conservation, biodiversity and visitor alike. In effect, it enables the aligning of conservation objectives of the Parks with increasing visitor appeal and numbers. The Masterplan guides the phased development of these enhanced visitor facilities and improved visitor experiences based on research into international best practice. The Department intends to produce visitor and management plans for its National Parks on an on-going basis, the availability of resources permitting.</p>  <p>    As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and recreation product, it has been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. In this context, it should be noted that my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; owned re-wilding project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park.</p>  <p>  In 2019 over &euro;5m from the Rural Regeneration fund was announced for the Parks and Reserves providing infrastructure that allows sustainable access to them. Most of these projects have been initiated and some of those recently concluded include the purchase of Electric Buses for visitors of Glenveagh National Park, improved trail networks in the Sliabh Blooms and enhanced trails in Dromore and Derrycrag Nature Reserves. In the last 5 years to date over &euro;16.3m in current funding and nearly &euro;7.8m in capital funding has been spent in our National Parks and Reserves, in areas including invasive species control and infrastructure improvement.</p>  <p>  Given the resources available for investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am of course mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands; the Department focuses on conservation objectives for Natura 2000 sites. Ireland's 3rd National Biodiversity Plan runs from 2017 to 2021 and captures the objectives, targets and actions for biodiversity to be undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders in government, civil society and private sectors to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Vision for Biodiversity not just in our own National Parks but countrywide.</p></reply>

My Department is currently working to establish the structures to examine the issue of defective housing, this will include apartment buildings, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  I recently appointed Mr Seamus Neely, former Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, to the position of Chair to the independent working group to oversee the effective implementation of the group&rsquo;s terms of reference which are currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  In regard to the issues raised by the Deputy on planning matters, section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (the Act) precludes me from intervening or commenting on any particular cases either at local authority level or with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant to the operation of section 35 of the Act, which relates directly to particular developments or proposed developments which are the subject of a deliberative assessment process. It is a matter solely for a Planning Authority to invoke the operation of Section 35 subject to the requirements set out in legislation.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the regulation of builders, the Government is committed to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, or CIRI, on a statutory footing.  CIRI was established on a voluntary basis in 2014 and 798 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register. The voluntary register can be viewed online at the following link:  www.ciri.ie/register/.</p>  <p>  Government approved the General Scheme of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing on 30 May 2017, which was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The General Scheme, which was published in 2017, is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/3e711-building-control/.</p>  <p>  The main objective of the proposed legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  The Bill will also allow for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds and provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation.  </p>  <p>  This legislation is a key component of the ongoing building control reform agenda, which also includes the amendments made to the Building Control Regulations and the establishment of the National Building Control Office. This agenda provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in Q1 of this year.</p></reply>

Prior to publication, draft statistical returns are run by the relevant OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) experts for assurance that Ireland's reported spend meets the DAC's criteria to be counted as ODA.  This assurance is important to maintaining Ireland's reputation as a quality donor.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Annual Report on the Government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme was launched on 10 November 2020.  The text is available on the Irish Aid website.  To enable publication of the 2019 report during 2020, it was decided to go ahead without the full complement of statistical annexes - there were a number of annexes whose progress through the DAC assurance process was delayed, in part due to changed work arrangements arising from COVID-19.  Three of the outstanding annexes have since been published on the Irish Aid website and the final three annexes will be published on the Irish Aid website before the end of January.</p></reply>

Even with an EU-UK trade deal in place, the UK is no longer a member of the Single Market and Customs Union.  This means that businesses must engage with a range of checks and controls on their trade with the UK that did not previously apply.</p>  <p>  The Government appreciates that this presents significant challenges for many business and sectors and brings additional challenges to supply chains.  We have put in place a range of dedicated supports and are providing ongoing assistance to assist traders in adapting to the new procedures.  Where difficulties have arisen for users in specific cases, the Government has been engaging directly with them to get these difficulties resolved.  We are working 24/7 to ensure trade can flow to the greatest extent possible but industry also has to do its part to make this work.  The best way to ensure that goods pass as smoothly and efficiently as possible through our ports is to correctly complete the required paperwork in advance of moving those goods.  In recent days, we have seen that more than 70% of trucks are doing this and are being &lsquo;green-lighted&rsquo; to leave our ports directly upon disembarkation.</p>  <p>  The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners continue to be available to assist businesses and I would urge traders to make use of the available resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to note that the Revenue Commissioners issued updated guidance on the import of vehicles from Great Britain and Northern Ireland in light of the new trading arrangements that are now in place.</p></reply>

The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether the continuation of the union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held.</p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. The decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for this Government. The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island of Ireland, North and South. Should there be a vote in favour of constitutional change in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, on the constitutional future that they wish to see for Northern Ireland. These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration and the Government will continue to engage and reflect on them.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, in March, the UK Government published a Written Ministerial Statement which proposed significant changes to the Stormont House framework. I have engaged with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and others regularly since that time to make clear the serious concerns of the Government in this respect, to set out our position that the Stormont House Agreement is the path forward, and to underline the critical importance of a collective approach to legacy.</p>  <p>  With respect to a truth and reconciliation commission, within the framework of the Stormont House Agreement, it is envisioned that the role of the ICIR will be to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about the Troubles-related deaths of their next of kin.</p>  <p>  The ICIR agreement was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in October 2015 and laid before the Oireachtas in January 2016. The Independent Commission can only be formally established once the necessary legislation has been enacted and the two Governments have notified each other of completion of all other domestic legal procedures required to bring the agreement into force.</p>  <p>  The Government remains ready to engage and work with the British Government and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive in partnership on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead, with a view to reaffirming a collective approach that is consistent with the Stormont House Agreement framework, and for all victims, survivors and society as a whole.</p></reply>

The opening of the Consulate General is a clear sign of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to deepening its relationship with Germany.</p>  <p>  The Consulate currently operates in a temporary location. Work is ongoing to identify a long-term property option that will function as an Ireland House. The Consulate hopes to move into its permanent Ireland House location by the end of 2021 which would serve as the major platform for the Irish community, business and cultural activities in the region.</p>  <p>  The Consulate&rsquo;s priority objectives include:</p>  <p>- Establishing strong relationships with the Government, Parliament and Ministries in Hessen, the Rhineland Palatinate and Saarland as well as with the European Central Bank and Single Supervisory Mechanism in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>- Promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic reputation and build business links in the region.</p>  <p>- Undertaking an intensive public diplomacy programme, with a media and cultural promotion focus, to develop Ireland&rsquo;s profile and image.</p>  <p>  The Consulate General works closely with the Embassy of Ireland in Berlin, under the overall direction of the Ambassador, including on the implementation of the Germany-Ireland Joint Plan of Action for Enhanced Bilateral and EU Co-operation.</p>  <p>  The Consulate is playing an important role in developing the strong partnership between Ireland and Germany. It has built relationships at senior levels with the State Governments and their economic agencies to promote Irish interests.</p>  <p>  It also works closely with the Irish State Agencies based in Frankfurt (IDA and Tourism Ireland) and D&uuml;sseldorf (Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia) to promote Irish economic and business interests. The Consulate General is actively involved in working with Irish companies in deepening links with the region.</p>  <p>  The Consulate also provides consular assistance on an on-going basis, often on Covid-19 related-issues, particularly in view of Frankfurt&rsquo;s status as a major hub airport.  The 2,000-strong Irish community living in the region have benefited from the shorter distance when accessing consular services and in participating in the many outreach activities organised by the Consulate. The Consulate is also extensively involved in the promotion of Irish culture, including through supporting Ireland&rsquo;s presence at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair and organising regular cultural activities such as book clubs and performances of Irish music and dance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-20a.739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012000084#WRS01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264, 266 and 267 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, it has become clear that there will soon be a significant reduction in the number of Irish officials in senior roles in the EU Institutions, as many high-ranking Irish officials will soon retire. At the current rates of recruitment of Irish permanent staff, we are far below the replacement rate. This poses a serious challenge.  It is clear that more needs to be done in this area. That is why the Programme for Government commits to the development of a new strategy to increase the number of Irish people in the EU Institutions.</p>  <p>  Last October, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne T.D., launched a public consultation on Ireland&rsquo;s EU jobs strategy. In total, the consultation received 124 responses. I am grateful for the high level of public engagement with the consultation, and the thoughtful suggestions received. Submissions to the consultation identified factors contributing to the low number of Irish people entering the institutions, and suggested steps the new strategy could take to address the issues identified.</p>  <p>  Following this consultation, officials in my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working together to develop Ireland&rsquo;s overall policy approach to EU staffing.</p>  <p>  The strategy will include proposals aimed at increasing the number of Irish people securing positions within the EU Institutions. While work on the strategy is ongoing, I hope it will be published in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The new strategy will build upon existing work carried out by my Department in promoting careers in the EU through the EU Jobs campaign. The campaign publicises EU career opportunities, including traineeships, in Ireland&rsquo;s third-level institutions. The campaign also provides support to Irish citizens who have applied for permanent jobs in the EU Institutions, providing information and advice for the duration of the recruitment competition. Those interested can go to www.dfa.ie/eujobs for more information.</p>  <p>  It will also include a commitment to increase the number of Irish civil servants seconded annually to the EU Institutions. The Centrally Funded Scheme (CFS) for Seconded National Experts was established in 2014 to support the secondment of Irish Government officials to the EU. The scheme, which provides for secondments to international as well as EU institutions, had a budget of &euro;1.8 million for 2020. In 2020, it financed the secondment of twenty-six Irish officials to the EU Institutions. The CFS budget for 2021 has been increased to &euro;2 million. This means that Ireland will have the capacity to second more officials to the Institutions than in any year since the scheme was established in 2013.</p>  <p>  In addition to this scheme, the National Expert in Professional Training programme is also open to Irish civil servants, giving Irish officials the opportunity to have a short-term placement in the EU&rsquo;s Institutions.</p>  <p>  From time to time, positions within the European External Action Service (EEAS) open to Irish officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs. These placements usually take the form of secondments or temporary assignments from the Department to the EEAS. A total of 9 Irish diplomats currently work for the EEAS, either at its Headquarters in Brussels or in one of the 140 EU Delegations located around the world.</p>  <p>  In addition, Irish citizens also take part in the Junior Professionals in Delegation Programme run by the EEAS and the European Commission, and places highly-qualified junior professionals from Member States in EU Delegations around the world. The application period for this programme is open now and will close on 31 January. The EU has made two places available to Irish candidates under this year&rsquo;s programme. My Department also intends to finance an additional two places for Irish candidates this year. Those interested in applying for the programme should consult the EEAS and DFA websites for more information.</p></reply>

The approach has been to prioritise effective policy and operational measures across the Department to manage Brexit impacts, with additional staff assigned or recruited as required.</p>  <p>  In recent years my Department has established new posts in Madrid, Berlin, Paris, Rome, The Hague and Warsaw as well as at the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels in preparation for Brexit.  Ireland maintains an Embassy in each of the EU Member State capitals and, in recognition of Frankfurt's role as the financial capital of the Euro area, a new Consulate was opened there in 2019.</p>  <p>  The 'Global Ireland 2025' initiative will continue to support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism and underpin economic recovery. The strategy will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend national positions in the post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has increased staffing in the Embassy in London, opened a Consulate in Cardiff and recently announced the opening of a new Consulate in Manchester later this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government provides for further strengthening of the diplomatic and state agency network across the European Union and its neighbourhood.</p>  <p>  Further strengthening of staffing in the existing EU Mission network remains under review.</p></reply>

We are committed to being an active and constructive Council member and are engaging across the full Council agenda, which includes some 30 country and regional files and 20 thematic files.</p>  <p>  Three core principles will frame our approach: building peace, strengthening conflict prevention and ensuring accountability.</p>  <p>  In line with these principles, Ireland has identified specific priorities, including: improving peacekeeping mandates, linking peacekeeping with peacebuilding, highlighting the drivers of conflict such as climate change and grave violations of human rights, advancing inclusive approaches to peacebuilding involving women, youth and civil society, and promoting respect for international law and accountability.</p>  <p>  Elected Security Council members take on a number of leadership roles during their terms, including chairing Sanctions Committees and thematic Working Groups and acting as primary drafters (Penholders) of some Security Council Resolutions.</p>  <p>  Ireland has assumed the role of Facilitator for UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which deals with the Iran nuclear deal; chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee; co-chair, alongside Mexico, of the Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security; and co-chair, along with Niger, of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security. Ireland will also act as co-penholder, with Niger, on the UN Office in West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS); and co-penholder, with Norway, on humanitarian issues in Syria. Each of these roles reflect aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s existing foreign policy priorities and strengths.</p>  <p>  Ireland will hold the Presidency of the Security Council in September 2021, and will chair all meetings of the Council during that month.</p>  <p>  This is a Government-wide effort, and the Department of Foreign Affairs is working closely with other Departments, including through a recently established inter-departmental working group. We are engaging with academic and civil society partners, including a stakeholder forum, in conjunction with the IIEA.</p>  <p>  I look forward to keeping the Oireachtas informed of our work on the Council.</p></reply>

I met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 7 January to discuss developments in relation to Rockall.</p>  <p>  The Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the longstanding fisheries tradition in the area around Rockall, and has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities on the matter. The issue was raised in the context of my meeting with my Scottish counterpart, Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, Europe and External Affairs, Michael Russell, on 14 January 2021. We have agreed to keep in contact on the matter.</p>  <p>  Myself and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as our respective officials, are considering all options for further engagement on the issues involved and are continuing to work closely together.</p>  <p>  The new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 January 2021.  Irish officials remain in ongoing contact with the Commission on all matters relating to the Agreement, including fisheries.</p>  <p>  While engagement continues on the issue of Rockall, the Government have indicated that there is an increased risk of enforcement action being taken by Scottish fisheries control authorities against Irish vessels operating in the waters around Rockall. The skipper of the Northern Celt also contacted this Department and a response has issued to him, setting out the current position.</p>  <p>  Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall, which is a small uninhabitable granite rock located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and some 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal. Ireland has never recognised British sovereignty claims over Rockall, and accordingly has not recognised a 12 nautical mile territorial sea around it either. This remains the position of the Government.</p></reply>

It also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis including the provision of air ambulance services to the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Aeromedical Desk in its National Emergency Operations Centre is responsible for the co-ordination of all health-related air transport arrangements. In addition to the Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard and private air ambulance operators also provide air transport services for the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps&rsquo; inter-hospital service operates out of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  This service provides transport for patients and medical teams primarily between hospitals within Ireland and the UK.  In  2020, the Air Corps completed a total of 48 inter-hospital missions, 33 of which were to the UK , including one priority transfer.  5 missions were outside of the agreed Service Level Agreement whereby the Air Corps provided the requested air transport of patients to or from mainland Europe. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps also operates the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) Service.  It is a daily, day-time service based out of Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Since the commencement of this service in June 2012, the Air Corps has completed over 3,000 missions with 366 missions completed during 2020.  </p>  <p>  The EAS and inter-hospital services are good examples of the Air Corps and HSE combining their resources to deliver life-saving services for the people of Ireland.  There are no plans to change the current operation of the aeromedical services based out of Baldonnel or Custume Barracks, Athlone.  </p></reply>

Over the past year, we have all seen how vital in-person education is for children with complex needs. </p><p>This matter has been highlighted not only by the families of the children themselves, but also by all the partners in education and representative groups, in regular meetings with me and my officials. Everyone recognises that distance learning does not work for every child.</p><p>Recent weeks have seen intense and regular engagement with partners to seek a solution to our shared objective to support children with complex needs return to in-school learning, could be reached.</p><p>My Department sought to agree an approach balancing the need to support our most vulnerable children while addressing the issues raised by trade unions and school management bodies.</p><p>These included requests for clear messaging around public health to be given directly to their members by Public Health specialists, temporary arrangements during the current phase of reopening for high risk staff and for those experiencing childcare difficulties.</p><p>In response my Department set out to the unions how it these concerns would be addressed. This included:</p><p>-  Temporary flexible accommodations to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care</p><p>-  Temporary waivers to notice periods around parental leave and unpaid leave schemes </p><p>-  Speedy turnaround for applications through the National Childcare scheme with subsidies for full time childcare available</p><p>-  A webinar to address public health concerns was held by the Deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn and senior public health consultants which was directly accessible through online streaming to all education sector staff </p><p>Public Health Officials reaffirmed clearly that schools with risk mitigation measures in place provide a safe environment for staff and children. </p><p>While the general public heath advice is that people stay at home, this does not apply to workers providing an essential service like teachers and SNAs. </p><p>In this context it is considered that schools could reopen for just over 23,000 children with SEN (or just 4% of those who would attend during a full re-opening). These children are those who experience the greatest difficulty benefitting from remote learning.</p><p>Despite this there is still no commitment from the primary teacher and SNA trade unions, INTO and FORSA, to advise their members to commence the limited return of in-person learning for children with special educational needs. </p><p>I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that children with complex needs can return to in-person learning as immediately as possible and I will continue to engage with stakeholders on the issue. </p><p>In the interim I am confident that schools will continue to make significant efforts to provide effective remote learning experiences for these children.  </p><p>My Department has issued updated guidance on continuity of schooling: supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs (with separate guidance for mainstream primary/special schools and for post-primary schools). </p><p>This outlines that teachers in special schools and special classes should make every effort to maintain regular contact with all of their pupils, and where appropriate, make provision for one-to-one online supports.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for schools regarding the provision of distance learning is also available through the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies including for those pupils with special educational needs.</p></reply>

It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. I recognise the importance of listening to students, representatives of whom are on the Advisory Group. The advisory group also includes representatives of parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 state examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks  from 11 January. . </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p><p>On Monday 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication.</p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has published the revised arrangements for Classroom-Based Assessments for students entering third year in 2020. Details are available at . </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p></reply>

These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p>  <p>  This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  As part of the guidance, schools were advised to research various digital platforms for facilitating communication between teachers and pupils and supporting pupils learning remotely. Schools should use the most appropriate whole-school approach for their context. In some schools, the use of digital communication platforms may not be appropriate or possible for some pupils.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that the learning of all pupils/students are supported at this time.  Teachers should continue to engage with their pupils/students and differentiate teaching and learning in line with their pupils&rsquo;/students&rsquo; needs to minimise disruption to their learning and progression.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this is a challenging time for pupils, teachers, other school staff and parents, and a strong focus should be kept on wellbeing and self-care during this time. Resources to support the wellbeing of school communities when schools are closed have been revised by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department and include a guide for parents on supporting children and young people with daily routines while schools are closed, advice on how to calm and support your child and advice on managing stress and anxiety.

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Based on the public health advice published in July 2020, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7th August and from NPHET on the 18th August 2020, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, using 50% of passenger capacity. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children. The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of months while Bus &Eacute;ireann is continuing to put in place the additional services required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Before Christmas circa 74% of total post-primary routes were operating at 50% capacity, comprising 70% of SEN post-primary and 76.5% of mainstream post-primary, and planning is underway for all remaining routes to be implemented at 50% capacity in the coming weeks; this will be progressed as schools re-open. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education have supported all bus contractors to put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on the buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible. This reduces the interaction of children on the buses with those outside of their family, class or school. </p></reply>

These documents have been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 which required all schools to put in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice. My Department has also provided updated specific guidance to advise on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of vulnerable students and those at risk if educational disadvantage during school closures due to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Many schools have already introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning. The guidance sets out approaches that schools can take and my Department will be asking schools to ensure that there is a specific focus on ensure that these pupils are supported. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided significant additional resources to schools to help support the provision of ICT equipment and to prioritise the needs of students that do not otherwise have access to ICT. My Department issued &euro;50m in April 2020 in Digital Strategy ICT grant funding in respect of the 2019-2020 school year, including &euro;10m brought forward. A further &euro;50m issued in December 2020 in respect of the 2020-2021 school year. Schools were advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Services will engage with principals to promote connectedness to schools for children who are at risk of educational disadvantage and there will be direct liaison by education welfare officers to Direct Provision accommodation centres, refuges for families experiencing domestic violence and homeless hubs to ensure students are linked with their schools. </p>  <p>  My Department spends in the region of &euro;125 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million was allocated to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimize any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.  </p></reply>

It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. I recognise the importance of listening to students, representatives of whom are on the Advisory Group. The advisory group also includes representatives of parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 state examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks  from 11 January. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. </p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p><p>On Monday 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication.</p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has published the revised arrangements for Classroom-Based Assessments for students entering third year in 2020. Details are available at <i></i>. </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 all schools have drafted new policies for publication on the school&rsquo;s website. These new admission policies have been approved by respective Patrons following consultation with school staff and parents of children attending the school, and are now published on individual school websites.

It is a school-based service with an overall objective of providing an educational psychology service to all schools, through the application of psychological theory and practice, to support the wellbeing, and academic, social and emotional development of all learners.  NEPS prioritises support for learners at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs.  NEPS provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities at this time.  This requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach to planning is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  </p>  <p>  NEPS has created a range of resources and support including Wellbeing Webinars for primary/special/post-primary schools, Wellbeing Toolkits for Schools with a range of easily downloadable, user-friendly materials and  advice and resources for parents,  student and school staff to support their wellbeing at this time.  Other resources include: </p>  <p>  Students</p>  <p>  -  Advice for young people while schools are closed</p>  <p>  -  A Plan for the Day &ndash; A template to support daily routines</p>  <p>  -  Managing Stress and Anxiety &ndash; a guide for students</p>  <p>  -  Panic attacks &ndash; a guide for students</p>  <p>  Teachers</p>  <p>  -  The response to stress information for school staff</p>  <p>  -  Normalising thoughts feelings and behaviour &ndash; a guide for school staff</p>  <p>  -  Guidelines for Teachers - Listen, Connect, Model &amp;amp; Teach (This guide has been developed to enable teachers to talk in a comforting and supportive way with students who may need the support of the Student Support Team at this time</p>  <p>  -  Managing Stress and Anxiety in students &ndash; A Guide for School Staff</p>  <p>  Parents</p>  <p>  -  A Guide for Parents on supporting children and young people with daily routines while schools are closed</p>  <p>  -  How to Calm and Support your Child &ndash; A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p>  <p>  -  Managing Stress and Anxiety - A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p>  <p>  These resources can be accessed on the gov.ie website.  </p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists continue to provide a service to schools via remote access.  All psychologists have been asked to continue to maintain contact with their assigned schools during this current period of school closure and they will continue to provide those elements of case work that can be managed remotely to support the learning and wellbeing of children and young people during this time. With the support of schools, this may include consultation with teachers and/or teachers and parents, input into Student Support Plans/Reviews and feedback to teachers and/or parents. NEPS will also continue to provide support to schools in the event of a critical incident.  </p>  <p>  In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist will identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p>  <p>  At post primary level, each school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, which is calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  Overall responsibility for the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies within the remit of the Department of Health. The Department of Health and HSE have ensured the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for young people. The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  These include the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in Budgets 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 221 w.t.e.  This includes an additional 17 psychologist posts to support the wellbeing of school communities.  </p>  <p>  Some 205 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000. The filling of the remaining posts is being actively pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service and a number of new appointments are imminent. </p>  <p>  This Government remains firmly committed to the maintenance of a robust and effective educational psychological service.</p></reply>

Over the past year, we have all seen how vital in-person education is for children with complex needs. </p><p>This matter has been highlighted not only by the families of the children themselves, but also by all the partners in education and representative groups, in regular meetings with Department officials. Everyone recognises that distance learning does not work for every child.</p><p>Recent weeks have seen intense and regular engagement with partners to seek a solution to our shared objective to support children with complex needs return to in-school learning, could be reached.</p><p>My Department sought to agree an approach balancing the need to support our most vulnerable children while addressing the issues raised by trade unions and school management bodies.</p><p>These included requests for clear messaging around public health to be given directly to their members by Public Health specialists, temporary arrangements during the current phase of reopening for high risk staff and for those experiencing childcare difficulties.</p><p>In response my Department set out to the unions how it these concerns would be addressed. This included:</p><p>-  Temporary flexible accommodations to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care</p><p>-  Temporary waivers to notice periods around parental leave and unpaid leave schemes </p><p>-  Speedy turnaround for applications through the National Childcare scheme with subsidies for full time childcare available</p><p>-  A webinar to address public health concerns was held by the Deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn and senior public health consultants which was directly accessible through online streaming to all education sector staff </p><p>Public Health Officials reaffirmed clearly that schools with risk mitigation measures in place provide a safe environment for staff and children. </p><p>While the general public heath advice is that people stay at home, this does not apply to essential workers providing an essential service. </p><p>In this context it is considered that schools could reopen for just over 23,000 children with SEN (or just 4% of those who would attend during a full re-opening). These children are those who experience the greatest difficulty benefitting from remote learning</p><p>Despite this there is still no commitment from the primary teacher and SNA trade unions, INTO and FORSA, to advise their members to commence the limited return of in-person learning for children with special educational needs. </p><p>I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that children with complex needs can return to in-person learning as immediately as possible.</p><p>In the interim I am confident that schools will continue to make significant efforts to provide effective remote learning experiences these children.  </p><p>My Department has issued updated guidance on continuity of schooling: supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs (with separate guidance for mainstream primary/special schools and for post-primary schools). </p><p>This outlines that teachers in special schools and special classes should make every effort to maintain regular contact with all of their pupils, and where appropriate, make provision for one-to-one online supports.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for schools regarding the provision of distance learning is also available through the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies including for those pupils with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned for this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i>www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/BI-EX-12232019.pdf</i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.  </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>.  </p></reply>

Schools have been advised that Parents/guardians will require specific guidance on how best to support their children at home, when in a position to do so. It is important that parents are provided with clear information about how the tasks and activities will help their child make progress in their learning. </p><p>In particular, these young children will benefit from home learning packs that contain a range of materials to support engaging and fun early literacy and numeracy skill development, specific opportunities for hands-on, active development of early literacy and numeracy skills, opportunities to learn from home using the home environment in an experiential way in subjects such as Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) and the Visual Arts, and opportunities to share samples of learning activities with the class teacher and/or their peers. </p><p><i>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context for primary schools</i><i>(DE, October, 2020)</i>outlines how schools should implement remote teaching and learning approaches, when necessary. It advises teachers of infant classes to provide materials to support engaging and fun early literacy and numeracy skill development at home, opportunities for hands-on, active learning and opportunities to share learning with the class teacher and/or their peers. Teachers are required to connect with pupils on a daily basis and provide feedback on pupil progress. </p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has provided advice on wellbeing and resources to support schools, pupils and parents. This includes resources and supports for primary schools in supporting pupil&rsquo;s wellbeing in a remote learning context. Advice is also provided to learners of all ages on staying active and connected. </p><p>Schools have been provided with &euro;100m funding during 2020 to ensure that all pupils have sufficient access to technology to support remote teaching and learning, when needed.</p><p>Teachers of infant classes are best placed to make decisions about teaching and learning for their own pupils. They have the curriculum knowledge, the contextual knowledge of the pupils&rsquo; families and a deep understanding of their pupils&rsquo; needs. The Professional Development Service for Teachers has provided of resources to support teachers in this regard during periods of remote teaching and learning.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.</p>  <p>  Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p>  <p>  The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student-to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/BI-EX-12232019.pdf. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   </p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  </p></reply>

Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation.  Schools can use this funding, inter alia, to acquire software applications or platforms to enable remote learning and communications, and to provide for devices to be loaned to teachers and learners in particular where needed to enable engagement with remote learning. </p><p>Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. In addition my Department directly funds the provision of broadband connectivity for schools at a cost of some &euro;13m per annum.  School buildings will remain open to allow staff access where this is essential to facilitate remote learning.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for teachers and schools to provide remote learning has been, and continues to be made available through my Department&rsquo;s support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education team at www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie  The information on this website includes a link to a dedicated PDST portal  aimed at supporting teachers and schools in the remote learning environment. This resource includes information on popular communication and learning platforms, digital tools and resources, video conferencing, webinars to support and inspire teachers to identify good practice and a dedicated online course for teachers for remote learning. The Department&rsquo;s Education website www.scoilnet.ie also contains a wealth of curriculum tagged resources that can be used by teachers, students and parents to support the continuity of learning in the remote environment.</p><p>The continuity of learning guidance circulated to schools last year advised Principals of the responsibility to ensure that learners receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with the school in which they are enrolled. Regular and ongoing communication between school and home will be essential to support engagement with learning and continuous connection with classmates and school community.  Additional supports will be provided for these learners from within the staffing resources of the school. Schools will have discretion to manage and redistribute their support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils and students. </p></reply>

This decision was to support the overall public health objective to limit the movement of people in society while aiming to protect certain groups who would be more adversely impacted by school closure. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s decision included prioritising in-person teaching and learning for two specific cohorts; pupils/ students attending special schools and classes and final year Leaving Certificate students. This decision was supported by the public health advice available to Government. </p><p>There has been continuous engagement with education partners on this matter since Christmas, building on weekly engagements between partners and public health throughout the school year. The voice of students is represented in those ongoing engagements by the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU).

It enables the student teacher to experience teaching and learning in a variety of contexts, and to participate in school life in a way that is structured and supported.</p>  <p>  In consultation with my Department and the relevant stakeholders, the Teaching Council published a Guidance Note on School Placement 2020/2021 in August 2020. In the context of Covid-19, this Guidance Note sets out a clear and flexible framework for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and schools in relation to the planning and facilitation of school placement for the academic year 2020-2021.</p>  <p>  It recognises a variety of sites of practice and learning in which school placement can be completed taking account of the sites of practice that emerged for teaching and learning following the closure of schools due to Covid-19 in March 2020. It also acknowledges that flexibility in terms of modes of assessment of student teachers by HEI tutors is necessary and outlines a range of feasible options that can be considered by HEIs. </p>  <p>  The guidance allows for student teachers to continue or commence their school placement with a particular school during the current period of remote teaching and learning.</p></reply>

This guidance to schools was developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including teachers, parents and learners.  The guidance included provision to support the continuity of teaching and learning in response to the Covid-19 restrictions for those learners unable to engage with online learning.  This guidance is all available at gov.ie.</p><p>In November 2020, a circular (No. 0074/2020) issued to all schools advising them of the requirement to put in place appropriate contingency measures, to include a Communication and Learning Platform, to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.  The circular sets out the comprehensive level of supports that are in place to assist schools with this process.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for teachers and schools to provide remote learning has been, and continues to be made available through my Department&rsquo;s support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education team at www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie  The information on this website includes a link to a dedicated PDST portal  aimed at supporting teachers and schools in the remote learning environment. This resource includes information on popular communication and learning platforms, digital tools and resources, video conferencing, webinars to support and inspire teachers to identify good practice and a dedicated online course for teachers for remote learning. My Department&rsquo;s education website www.scoilnet.ie also contains a wealth of curriculum tagged resources that can be used by teachers, students and parents to support the continuity of learning in the remote environment.</p><p>Schools can also apply to www.pdst.ie/schoolsupport for the assistance of a PDST adviser for tailored school support in all subject areas at Primary and Post-Primary levels including those pertaining to the use of Digital Technologies to support remote teaching, learning and assessment practices. The PDST Leadership team will also be available to support school leaders in leading the remote teaching and learning process through school support, national programmes and localised networks.</p><p>As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools, my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation.  Schools can use this funding, inter alia, to acquire software applications or platforms to enable remote learning and communications, and to provide for devices to be loaned to teachers and learners in particular where needed to enable engagement with remote learning. Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. In addition my Department directly funds the provision of broadband connectivity for schools at a cost of some &euro;13m per annum.  School buildings will remain open to allow staff access where this is essential to facilitate remote learning.</p><p>It is important to note that digital technology is a tool to be employed by teachers to deliver the curriculum and that it is not replacing the teacher in the teaching process. Regular engagement with pupils and students, appropriate and engaging learning opportunities, assessment and constructive feedback will continue to be important elements of the education provided by teachers.  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate will continue to offer an advisory service to schools to support the delivery of remote learning and to provide assistance to school leaders in particular. The Inspectorate will also evaluate and report on the quality of educational provision for students and will continue to carry out its other work as set out in Circulars 40/2020 and 41/2020. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the situation we find ourselves in is evolving all the time.  My Department, in working with the whole of Government, will keep the situation under review and update any advices to schools as required. It is with the work of all our stakeholders together that we will continue to provide the best education for all our pupils/students.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned for  this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at . Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, were issued recently by the SEC.</p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach to planning is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  </p><p>NEPS has created a range of resources and support including Wellbeing Webinars for primary/special/post-primary schools, Wellbeing Toolkits for Schools with a range of easily downloadable, user-friendly materials and  advice and resources for parents, student and school staff to support their wellbeing at this time.  Resources include:</p><p>Students</p><p>- Advice for young people while schools are closed</p><p>- A Plan for the Day &ndash; A template to support daily routines</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>- Panic attacks &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>Teachers</p><p>- The response to stress information for school staff</p><p>- Normalising thoughts feelings and behaviour &ndash; a guide for school staff</p><p>- Guidelines for Teachers - Listen, Connect, Model &amp;amp; Teach (This guide has been developed to enable teachers to talk in a comforting and supportive way with students who may need the support of the Student Support Team at this time</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety in students &ndash; A Guide for School Staff</p><p>Parents</p><p>- A Guide for Parents on supporting children and young people with daily routines while schools are closed</p><p>- How to Calm and Support your Child &ndash; A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety - A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p><p>These resources can be accessed on the gov.ie website.</p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to provide a service to schools via remote access.  All psychologists have been asked to continue to maintain contact with their assigned schools during this period of school closure.<b></b>NEPS psychologists will continue to provide those elements of case work that can be managed remotely to support the learning and wellbeing of children and young people during this current period of school closure. With the support of schools, this may include consultation with teachers and/or teachers and parents, input into Student Support Plans/Reviews and feedback to teachers and/or parents. NEPS will also continue to provide support to schools in the event of a critical incident.</p><p>In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist will identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p><p>At post primary level, each school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, which is calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.</p><p>As part of the resources announced to support schools 17 additional NEPS psychologists were sanctioned to provide enhanced services to support the wellbeing of our school communities at this time and 120 additional posts have been provided for guidance counselling in post primary schools.</p><p>Overall responsibility for the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies within the remit of the Department of Health. My Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department of Health and HSE have ensured the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for young people. The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  These include the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.</p></reply>

This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at . Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, were issued recently by the SEC.</p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

The Department is reviewing 2,668 claims for a jobseeker's payment and is writing to the individual employees requesting that they contact their employer for the information that is required to complete the review. The employer is required to complete a UP38 form in respect of the employee, providing details for each day in the review period on whether the employee was employed/remunerated. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to a casual jobseeker's or short-time work support payment for any day during the review period depends, among other things, on whether or not a person received remuneration from their employer, including TWSS, for that day. Each case needs to be examined individually to determine if the remuneration paid by the company concerned was in respect of a complete period or only specific days within a period. This will determine if a person may be entitled to a casual jobseeker's payment in respect of the days on which a person did not work and were not remunerated.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with the company and has also made an arrangement with the company that, if my Department asks its employees for particular information, the company is aware of what is required and will immediately supply it to the employee via email.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, because of the volume and complexity of claims involved and the need to go back to individuals, the process will take some time.  </p>  <p>  My staff are committed to keep processing these claims until a decision is reached on each one and is working to complete the reviews as quickly as possible.

In addition, more flexibility has been introduced to the rules around nominating an agent to collect social welfare payments at a post office on someone else&rsquo;s behalf.</p>  <p>  Also, for the duration of the pandemic, alternative payment arrangements, such as the option to have one&rsquo;s payment made directly into a current account by electronic fund transfer (EFT), are accommodated at the request of a customer to the Department. This allows for the payment to be made directly into a current account in any financial institution, whether that be with An Post, a bank or a credit union.</p></reply>

This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex. As a consequence, the Programme for Government also committed to establishing a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including sustainability, eligibility, contributions and calculation methods. The Terms of Reference for this Commission includes consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependents can be accommodated within the State pension system. The Commission has been established, has already commenced work and is scheduled to report to me on its work, findings, options and recommendations by 30th June 2021. The Government has committed to taking action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within six months of the recommendations being made.</p>  <p>  The State pension system already gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role, through the award of credits and/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (Aggregated Calculation Method). Details of these are - </p>  <p>  - Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits. Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.</p>  <p>  - Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory). The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing the Yearly Average.</p>  <p>  - HomeCaring Periods &ndash; This Scheme makes it easier for a home carer to qualify for a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory). HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Calculation Method (also known as Interim TCA or T12) of pension calculation. HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution.</p>  <p>  The Homemaker's Scheme and HomeCaring Periods cannot be used together to calculate State Pension (Contribution) entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Aggregated Contribution Method, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner. The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. To allow pensioners choose the elements in how their pension is calculated would likely incur very significant costs which could further undermine the sustainability of the State Pension system. The cost of paying the State Pension is already increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 2.5 years or so, due to demographic pressures alone. It is also estimated that my Department will spend over &euro;8.8 billion on State Pensions in 2021.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory). Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Based on ESRI research, three key social welfare payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  </p>  <p>  From January 2021, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks, while the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels will not take effect until May 2021.  This will ensure that recipients will benefit from the increased payment over this winter period.  </p>  <p>  Financial assistance is available under the Exceptional Needs Payment and the Urgent Needs Payment schemes, on a year round basis, to assist with expenditure which a person could not reasonably meet out of his/her weekly income, which may include exceptional heating costs.  Applications are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Following the recent activation of Level 5 measures, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has put in place a moratorium on all disconnections of domestic customers to take effect from 8 January 2021.

Disablement benefit is not a means tested payment and is based on a person&rsquo;s PRSI record. Disablement benefit can be paid to people in employment and also paid in addition to most other Social Protection payments. </p>  <p>  The only exception is where the person on disablement benefit is also in receipt of incapacity supplement, then fuel allowance can be paid subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria.  Incapacity supplement is an increase to disablement benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work, as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit.</p>  <p>  The guidelines for the fuel allowance scheme are kept under review.  However, any decision to extend the eligibility criteria to allow a person in receipt of disablement benefit to qualify for the fuel allowance could not be considered in isolation, which in turn would have cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department operates both Exceptional and Urgent Needs for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

The design and delivery of the measures within the Government's Action Plan will be directly informed by the views of survivors, their families and advocates. </p>  <p>  The State accepts its responsibility for the failure to listen and act in the past, and in more recent times. Engagement and consultation around the Action Plan requires specific structures, systems and resources to ensure it is inclusive and effective. Innovative methods are required to achieve this objective, especially given the continuing challenges presented by the restrictions necessary to reduce the public health risks associated with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I want to commence this enhanced dialogue as quickly as possible. As a first step, I want to consult with members of the Collaborative Forum, as I believe that a new and enhanced model of engagement, which builds upon the strengths of the existing process, can add to the Forum&rsquo;s significant work to date. I have issued invitations to forum members for two meetings so we can discuss how best to develop dedicated channels of communication and increase opportunities for direct engagement with the large number of stakeholders and their representative groups. We need to deepen our understanding of the full range of perspectives on these deeply personal issues and the specific needs of survivors now and into the future.</p></reply>

EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible and paid employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll; and it charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid that are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  ELC and SAC services registered with Tusla received an exemption from the EWSS turnover requirements. This additional benefit exempts providers from demonstrating a decline of 30% turnover to be eligible for EWSS.  Furthermore, the rate of subsidy the employer will receive per paid eligible employee under EWSS was enhanced on 20 October 2020 in response to nationwide level 5 restrictions and will continue to be made available during this period.</p>  <p>  Under the enhanced rates, the average ELC and SAC service with EWSS will have approximately on average 80% of payroll costs covered. This equates to approximately 50% of the usual operating costs of the average service &ndash; allowing them to operate sustainably with lower occupancy rates and higher delivery costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to provide all ELC and SAC subsidy schemes at existing capitation and subsidy rates during the current Level 5 restriction until the end of January. These include the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) Saver Programme, Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Saver Programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme. My Department will continue to pay these subsidies in respect of children who can no longer attend while the current Level 5 measures are in effect, due to current restrictions  where services are provided to children of essential workers and vulnerable children only.</p>  <p>  Despite beneficiary schemes funding continuing to flow from the Department, along with access to the EWSS, some services may be left with short-term sustainability concerns due to lower income levels arising from current restrictions. Officials within my Department are currently developing a specific strand of funding to support sustainability issues arising out of the impact of full and part time early learning and care and school age childcare services opening only for the children of essential workers and vulnerable children. Further details will issue in due course. </p>  <p>  My Department also oversees a case management support facility through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide assistance to ELC and SAC services in difficulty. This support can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting, cash flow difficulties, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. Any service that has concerns about their viability during the current Level 5 restrictions should contact their local CCC in the first instance. </p></reply>

While my Department does not have the contact details necessary to directly reach to the many thousands with a connection to these matters, it was important to do what was possible to ensure former residents were informed first, giving them the recognition and respect to which they are entitled.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of deep regret that details of the report were leaked ahead of its publication. I contacted survivors immediately on learning of the coverage in a Sunday newspaper and the matter is now under investigation at Government level. I understand why many survivors feeling hurt and let down that any element of the report might be shared before the webinar. This is not what we had planned and it should not have happened. </p>  <p>  The links necessary to connect to the webinar were provided to the Department's email circulation list ahead of the event. Part of that communication was to advise that the links to the event could be shared with any person with a connection to the matters being investigated by the Commission. As a result approximately 600 participants connected to the event.</p>  <p>  Immediately following the Cabinet meeting on 12 January, the arranged webinar was hosted by An Taoiseach, with myself and Minister of State Anne Rabbitte. It was unfortunate that we could not meet in person with survivors to engage directly with them on this long awaited report, and holding the event online was the only practical option. I acknowledge the limitation of the webinar approach as I know it was not ideal.</p>  <p>  One complication of holding the event online is that we could not have the kind of interaction we normally would have. I know some participants may have wished to speak and comment in response to the major findings of the report. Personally, I would have much preferred such meaningfully engagement on the day. However, it was not possible at that point due to the sheer scale of this event . </p>  <p>  The Office of An Taoiseach provided the digital platform and hosted the event. The official hosting on the day, facilitated a live webchat, where participants could submit comments and questions live as the event unfolded. I did have an opportunity to field and respond to a very small number of these questions, primarily relating to the practical arrangements around publication. The remaining questions have been reviewed by my Department to ensure any themes can be addressed by updating our published Frequently Asked Questions. I also invited participants to contact my Department by phone or email and we have had several hundred contacts since the report&rsquo;s publication.</p></reply>

It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  </p>  <p>  The objectives of the pioneering Scheme, which form the rationale behind the underlying funding model, are to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation, tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for thousands of families, and establish a sustainable platform for investment in the Irish childcare sector for decades to come. </p>  <p>  The universal subsidy is available to all families with children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later). The universal subsidy is based on the child&rsquo;s age, and not on income. Parents do not have to undergo an assessment to avail of this subsidy. The subsidy currently provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place up to a maximum of 45 hours a week.</p>  <p>  To increase the cost to &euro;1 per hour would cost approximately &euro;18m. To increase the cost to &euro;1.50 per hour would cost approximately 37m.</p>  <p>  The funding model of the NCS is based on key assumptions around the preferences and behaviours of parents relating to working hours and childcare choice, rates of growth in demand, and certain metrics are extrapolated from available data. As such, all estimates remain heavily caveated insofar as the scheme represents a considerable departure from legacy schemes and this renders estimates inherently challenging. </p>  <p>  It is particularly difficult to estimate increases to the universal subsidy in regard to the 2019 figures, as there is insufficient data to consider due to the NCS launching in November 2019, and the suspension of the NCS for 3 months from April 2020 to June 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is fully committed to the success of the NCS in benefiting families across Ireland, and envisage its further growth into 2021 as families make greater use of childcare services as we recover from the impact of Covid-19. </p></reply>

I am confident that we will be in a position to fully achieve our existing commitment and the additional resources provided in Budget 2021 will ensure such transfers can take place on a consistent and sustainable basis.</p></reply>

This list does not include private or commercial music, drama or dance classes.</p><p>Education is, however, considered an essential service under the regulations. Under Part 2 of the schedule to the regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. My Department does not have sufficient information to determine if the music classes being referred to fall under this category.</p><p>Separately, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has published guidance to support the funded youth work sector.

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds. All seven universities have confirmed that students who choose to vacate their university-owned accommodation early will receive pro-rata refunds. The exact details of these refunds vary by institution, and students are encouraged to engage with their university directly on this manner. I would hope that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within the my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p></reply>

The aim is to reduce the cost to the student by ensuring that there is a sufficient level of accommodation to meet future demand. The target as set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland </i>and the NSAS is the provision of 7,000 bed spaces by end 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional PBSA beds by 2024.  The 2019 target has been surpassed, with 8,346 bed spaces completed by the end of the year.</p><p>Following significant rent increases in two privately run PBSA complexes in 2018, the Department of Education and Skills worked in close co-operation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to pass the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  The Act contains provisions designed to ensure that students residing in student-specific accommodation in Rent Pressure Zones will not see rent increases of more than 4% per annum. Registered students and licensors may also now avail of the dispute resolution facilities provided by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). The RTB has a dedicated section on their website -  - providing advice to student renters.</p><p>Students who are renting private accommodation under a lease are entitled to the same legal protections as any other tenant. Their tenant rights are set out in the Residential Tenancies Act (2004, as amended).  </p><p>Responding to student accommodation issues is a significant matter of concern for myself and for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and  I have asked my Department to continue to engage with his officials to monitor and report to me on developments in the student accommodation sector.</p></reply>

The NFQ is a framework through which learning achievements may be measured and related to each other in a coherent way.  Qualifications are organised within the NFQ based on their level of knowledge, skill and competence on a scale from 1-10. It allows for quality assurance, international comparison and clarification for learners on their qualification.</p>  <p>  An Honours Bachelor Degree is classed as a Level 8 on the NFQ.

It is of note that the Higher Diploma is typically in a different field of learning than the initial award.</p>  <p>  While both categories of qualification are at Level 8 on the NFQ, they may offer differing skill sets and competencies to graduates based on their programme of choice and field of study.

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education. In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 202/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education. </p>  <p>  In terms of student placements, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and including the representative bodies of education providers to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of teaching and learning, assessment and qualifications. This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU, in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers, to ensure that necessary arrangements are in place to maintain standards of education and training in this area so that students can progress e.g. from second year into third year or, where relevant, graduate with the relevant professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. Students should engage directly with their education provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.</p></reply>

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education. In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 202/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.</p></reply>

Measures include the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme which provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 payable over two years to support employers who take on and retain apprentices. Initially funded through the July Jobs Stimulus, the payment has been extended to include employers who take on apprentices until mid-2021. </p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus &euro;500,000 was also allocated to support the expansion of skills development for the National Retrofitting Programme and 2,000 additional places were also funded across Springboard and the Human Capital Pillar 1. &euro;8m has been allocated in 2021 to support retrofit specific skills which will provide for up to 500 places on new specialist retrofitting training courses targeted towards unemployed persons in addition to the expected increase of 400 places in programmes facilitating upskilling of experienced construction professionals.  This will increase the number of learners in retrofit specific programmes to over 1,500 per annum. A retrofitting centre of excellence is already in place under Waterford, Wexford Education and Training Board (ETB) while a further four ETBs are planning to have centres of excellence up and running in the first quarter of 2021. </p>  <p>  1,493 places are being provided through 34 Springboard courses and 14 courses funded under Pillar 1 of the Human Capital Initiative (HCI) in construction related areas.  Skillnet Ireland also supports the construction sector through two national Construction-specific Skillnet training networks, as well as through multiple regional Skillnet training networks that assist construction businesses located in their respective regions. </p>  <p>  In further education and training, approximately 6,256 beneficiaries participated in SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training programmes provided by ETBs under the &lsquo;Built Environment&rsquo; skills cluster in 2019. Construction traineeship programs also provide skills for the construction industry in areas such as Construction Skills for Employment; Construction Operative with Tickets and Overhead Lines Operative.   </p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme, the number of apprentice placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 to 3,499 in 2019. The impact of Covid-19 and the closure of the construction sector in March 2020 impacted heavily on apprentice registrations in the first half of 2020. Registrations recovered in the second half of the year with the support of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, reaching a total of 3,104 registrations on construction related apprenticeships by year end.</p>  <p>  Among the 59 apprenticeships currently available at levels 5-10 on the National Framework of qualifications, the 25 traditional craft apprenticeships at level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications have been supplemented by new apprenticeships in geo-drilling (Level 6), with  programmes in scaffolding (level 5), roofing and cladding (level 5) and advanced quantity surveying (Level 9) due to launch in 2021. In accordance with the Programme for Government, a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship is in development to cover the period 2021-2025. It will set out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025 and is expected to be delivered shortly.</p></reply>

The key objective of this group was to develop a plan to develop a sustainable future for the Mayo Campus arising from concerns about the financial viability of the campus.</p>  <p>  As recently highlighted by GMIT the creation of a Technological University by the Connaught Ulster Alliance (CUA) will provide enormous opportunities for all stakeholders in the region, including those in Mayo. The strategic re-positioning of GMIT now underway in the context of the work by CUA which encompasses the developments planned for the Mayo Campus will help ensure its long-term sustainability and future development. </p>  <p>  I understand GMIT, following engagement with Mayo campus staff over an extended period is undertaking a strategic reorganisation process as part a critical element of the transformation process required to realise these benefits from TU designation. This reorganisation includes the proposed establishment of a new academic School for GMIT, led from the focused expertise that has been quietly but progressively growing at the Mayo campus and that GMIT have several new Governing Body members from the business community in Mayo who are enthusiastic and positive about the direction being taken. </p>  <p>  It is vital for GMIT and the future TU to offer an integrated service to all stakeholders working across the region and acting as one. All GMIT schools are intended to have a GMIT wide remit including Mayo, Galway and beyond. </p>  <p>  As you aware from the virtual meeting you attended with the GMIT President Dr Orla Flynn and myself in October, Dr. Flynn confirmed this to be the case. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that in Q4 2020 there has been:</p>  <p>  - communication with staff as to the proposed realignment of programmes within existing academic structures of GMIT</p>  <p>  - Meeting of President and several senior GMIT staff with Mayo Co. Co. to discuss GMIT input to the Mayo Economic Recovery Plan</p>  <p>  - Completion of works on roof and building fabric on the Castlebar campus</p>  <p>  The Mid Term Review report of the independent assessor will be presented to the HEA&rsquo;s Finance and Governance Committee by the end of Q1 2021. Once I receive further update from the HEA following this presentation I intend to arrange a meeting with Oireachtas members from the region to discuss the future strategies for the campus.</p></reply>

The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper, which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for international protection accommodation now rests with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) and his Department following the transfer of this function on 14 October 2020. DCEDIY is currently developing the White Paper, which will set out options, together with the recommended direction, for the new model of accommodation and services for international protection applicants and the transitional processes needed to implement the model.  Options for developing a not-for-profit approach are currently being examined by DCEDIY in this regard.  I understand my colleague, Minister O' Gorman, will bring proposals to Government in this regard in February. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to bring forward a regularisation scheme within 18 months of the formation of the Government, to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents, meeting specified criteria and bearing in mind Ireland's European Union (EU) and Common Travel Area (CTA) commitments. </p>  <p>  Work is underway in my Department to give effect to this commitment.  This work is being informed by an assessment of international best practice and having regard to our EU and CTA commitments.  I intend to consult with relevant Government Departments, civil society and other interested parties, before finalising the Scheme, which I expect to be in a position to launch in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their own and their family's status.  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. </p>  <p>  Regarding citizenship, my Department has not suspended the receipt or processing of citizenship applications at any stage during the pandemic. However, processing rates have unfortunately been negatively impacted by the attendant health and safety related restrictions. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. Earlier this week, I opened a temporary system which will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This temporary system is in place from 18 January 2021 until citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence. </p>  <p>It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March. </p></reply>

Both the Coroner and the Garda&iacute; provided any cooperation requested by the Commission during its work at the Tuam site. However, I understand that there is no active investigation being conducted into the Tuam discovery by the Garda&iacute; or by the Coroner. </p>  <p>  The Coroner is an independent quasi-judicial officer and it is a matter for him how to conduct any death investigation in accordance with his statutory functions, on the basis of the information made available to him. </p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Commission does not recommend any particular action on behalf of the Coroner with regard to the Tuam site.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth will progress the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill, which will provide for the establishment of a dedicated agency, by Government Order under a sponsoring Minister for a specific site, to undertake where necessary, a forensic standard excavation, exhumation and, where possible, identification of discovered remains, and provide for their respectful reinterment. </p>  <p>  This legislation will support intervention at the Tuam site, and any other site, where intervention is reasonably required based on the manifestly inappropriate nature of the interments.  </p>  <p>  This is a bespoke approach to address the very sensitive matter of the discovery of human remains at the Tuam site. The approach will effectively displace the relevant role of the Coroner, by disapplying the exhumation process in section 47 of the Coroners Act 1962. This is the most appropriate means to address the particular needs arising in my view.</p>  <p>  I support the approach proposed by Minister O'Gorman and have assured him of the full co-operation of my department and its agencies in implementing the actions set out in the legislation.</p></reply>

Successful applicants are granted a permission to reside in Ireland for a fixed period.</p>  <p>  Projects seeking funding under the IIP are assessed by an Independent Evaluation Committee, composed of senior civil and public servants from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies involved in enterprise development in Ireland.  The Evaluation Committee convenes at least four times a year to assess projects submitted for determination as suitable for IIP investment. </p>  <p>  The Evaluation Committee makes a determination as to whether a project is suitable for IIP investment and if deemed suitable, the individual application will be submitted to me for final approval. The current structure for assessment of IIP projects ensures that significant external expertise is available in making a decision to recommend a project. </p>  <p>  All enterprise applications are assessed on the basis of the profile of the applicant, the commercial viability of the project, employment outcomes associated with the proposed investment and the overall benefit to the Irish State.  Where necessary, the Evaluation Committee will request policy input from the relevant Lead Department if that Department is not already represented on the Committee, for example, input from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on Social Housing projects.</p>  <p>  The IIP is focused on supporting projects that are investment ready. A criteria for establishing same is that planning permission, where required, has been granted.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the project referred to by the Deputy, at the time that the application was being considered by the Evaluation Committee planning permission for the development had not been granted. The Evaluation Committee would not consider it appropriate for IIP permissions to be granted to projects where planning permission, if required, had not been approved. My Department understands that the planning permission issue in relation to this project is still ongoing.</p>  <p>  Once the planning permission issue has been decided, and if successful, it will be open to applicants to submit fresh applications if they so wish. However, it would be preferable that before any further applications are submitted, that the Project Sponsors engage directly in a meaningful manner with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to ensure that their previously highlighted concerns which contributed to the decision not to recommend the project as suitable for IIP funding are addressed appropriately. </p></reply>

The Act also established the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA), a statutory regulatory body specifically tasked with responsibility for licensing and regulating property services providers (auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents). </p>  <p>  Under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, any business or individual who provides a property service (other than those who are subject to a similar licence or authentication scheme in another EU Member State) must hold a valid licence from the PSRA. The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance and pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund. </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to carry out investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Improper conduct is defined in the Act as the commission by a licensee of an act which renders him or her no longer a fit and proper person to provide property services, the commission of a contravention of a specified provision of the Act or of a provision of regulations made under the Act, or the giving by the licensee of a statement of advised market value or advised letting value of land (including buildings) which is clearly unreasonable. </p>  <p>  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Minimum Standards) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 564 of 2020), which came into effect on 30 November 2020, set out a range of minimum standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees to their clients.  In accordance with these Regulations, a licensee is obliged to inform the client in writing, as soon as reasonably possible on becoming aware of any conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, in the provision of a property service. I am therefore satisfied that the Regulations adequately address the issue of conflicts of interest in the provision of property services.</p>  <p>  As I have already stated, failure to comply with the standards set out in the Regulations amounts to improper conduct.  Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions: namely, issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, suspend or revoke a licence. It can also direct the licensee to pay a financial penalty of up to &euro;50,000 into the Property Services Compensation Fund, up to &euro;50,000 to the PSRA towards the cost of the investigation, up to &euro;250,000 to the PSRA by way of financial penalty or any combination thereof.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants awarded totalling more than &euro;752,000.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>- and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address, <i>fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</i>.  </p></reply>

Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department are publicising this to ensure victims are aware of this fact and know that Garda&iacute; will support them at any checkpoint they encounter, regardless of their distance from home.  </p>  <p>  There is no doubt that restricted movement in the context of the pandemic poses an increased risk of domestic abuse, evidenced by figures reported by frontline services. This was a key concern for Government when considering the potential impact of restricting movements and in March, my Department developed an inter-agency plan which has prioritised tackling domestic abuse, raising awareness of the risks, as well as supporting victims during this period.</p>  <p>  My department has provided additional resources, support, enforcement and services which will continue to be made available throughout the pandemic. Domestic abuse cases are being prioritised by the Guards, through Operation Faoiseamh, the Legal Aid Board and, as already mentioned, the Courts. </p>  <p>  I also know that Garda&iacute; continue to develop their specialist services in this area and the fact that Divisional Protective Services Units have now been rolled out nationwide is very welcome. </p></reply>

However, processing rates have unfortunately been negatively impacted by the attendant health and safety related restrictions. </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p><p>It is a requirement of the naturalisation process that a current passport must accompany every application. The identity of every applicant must be confirmed to the greatest extent possible and a passport is a primary identifier.  Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office due to COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in delays in the return of some passports. </p><p>Applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons.  The citizenship website advises that in these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk <i>www.citizenshipinfo@justice.ie</i>with the relevant details including postal tracking reference if available. Any request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material detailing the reasons for travel, such as medical information. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly. </p><p>I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. Earlier this week, I opened a temporary system which will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This temporary system is in place from 18 January 2021 until citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence. </p><p>It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March. </p></reply>

I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the information set out in Table 1 outlines the vehicle budget and spend for 2019 - 2021.  Table 2 outlines the Prison Service Vehicle Maintenance budget and spend for years 2019-2021.  Table 3 outlines Fuel, Parking and Toll Expenditure for the years 2019 - 2020.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service operates the Prison Service Escort Corp for the purpose of transporting prisoners. Prisoners are required to be transferred between institutions, to and from court and to and from hospital. The Prison Service hold a mix of type and size of vehicles for these purposes. The size range varies from a one person cellular vehicle to a fourteen person cellular carrier within the custodial vehicle range.</p><p>Within the passenger fleet, the Service also has a range of medium sized cars which have a range of uses including the transportation of pregnant female prisoners.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service also has a range of small, medium and large commercial vehicles which cater for a wide range of uses, including use by trades officers for works within the prison grounds and for the movement of goods to supply Prison Stores. There are also some refrigerated vehicles included in the fleet for the movement of refrigerated goods.</p><p>At the end of 2020 the Irish Prison Service had a total fleet size of 247 active vehicles ranging in registration from 1997 to 2020. I am advised that the Prison Service Escort Corp review and examine the condition of the transport fleet at their disposal on an ongoing basis to ensure vehicles are roadworthy and safe for all users.</p><p>I can further advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service have purchased 28 new vehicles in the past two years and have committed to purchasing six further two cell custodial vehicles in 2021.  </p><p>The overall cost of maintaining and servicing the Irish Prison Service fleet fluctuates due to the age and the unique specifications required within the fleet.  Fuel costs had increased significantly up until end of March 2020. Subsequently with the onset of COVID 19 separate escort vehicles are required in the event a number of prisoners have to attend court with the need for COVID 19 infection control guidelines to be adhered to in order to have prisoners brought to and from court in a safe environment, which accounts for expenditure exceeding the budget in 2020.</p><p>Furthermore and again with the onset of the pandemic the Prison Service were obliged to carry out necessary works on a number of vehicles as a precautionary measure to ensure response vehicles were available should the need arise to transport a prisoner who may test positive to the virus. </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Transport Capital Budget and Expenditure</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year - Vehicles Purchased </th>       <th>Yearly Capital Budget <br /><br />&euro; </th>       <th>Yearly Capital Spend<br /><br />&euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1,350,000 </td>       <td>1,206,780 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>500,000 </td>       <td>542,908 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>250,000 </td>       <td>0 as at 18th January 2021 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2  - Transport Maintenance Budget and Expenditure.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Yearly Maintenance budget<br /><br />&euro; </th>       <th>Yearly Maintenance spend<br /><br />&euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1,150,000 </td>       <td>1,294,979 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>1,200,000 </td>       <td>1,467,112 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>1,150,000 </td>       <td>0 as at 18th January 2021 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 3 &ndash; Fuel, Parking and Toll Expenditure </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Fuel&euro;</th>       <th>Parking &amp;amp; Tolls&euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>505,390 </td>       <td>44,915 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>457,222 </td>       <td>25,202 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This pragmatic approach to deportation orders will continue for as long as is necessary.  </p>  <p>  The enforcement of a deportation order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  For the purpose of enforcing the Order, the person is required to present at the offices of the GNIB, either at the Burgh Quay office in Dublin, or at their local Immigration Office. They may be directed to attend at specified times on specific dates until such time as the deportation process has been completed.</p>  <p>  It is of course open to any person who is the subject of a deportation order to engage with voluntary repatriation arrangements, or to comply with their obligation to leave the country.  In those circumstances, the issue of enforced deportation does not arise. </p>  <p>  GNIB issue what are referred to as presentation letters on a regular basis to people who are subject to a Deportation Order, to ensure continued engagement and to keep them up to date on their requirements to present in person, as enshrined in legislation.  I am advised that the GNIB is not in a position to provide a definitive repatriation date to a person subject to a Deportation Order, therefore, provisional presentation dates are issued.  When a date for the repatriation process draws closer and where repatriation is unlikely to occur, owing to various reasons, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the GNIB will issue a new presentation letter to the person.  At all times, any person subject to a Deportation Order is kept appraised of the situation and the GNIB continue to engage with them by post, email and telephone.   </p>  <p>  Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.  In making a revocation request, a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case, including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department, so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. </p><p>The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division.

A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic will also benefit from these new arrangements over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured. </p></reply>

However, the specific offence remains one of driving without a licence, and so the code 'driving while disqualified' has now been discontinued. </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that additional powers were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, allowing the arrest of people, who drive while disqualified from holding a driver's licence, under section 6(b) and (c) of the Road Traffic Act 2014, which came into effect from 22 June 2015. </p><p>The following table as provided to me by the Garda authorities sets out the number of proceedings taken in relation to driving without a driving licence 2018 to 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Driving without a Driving licence*</td>       <td>22,564</td>       <td>20,557</td>       <td>16,868</td>    </tr> </table> <i>* All figures provided are provisional, operational and subject to change.</i></p><p>The statistics are not compiled in such a way as to identify specific number of detections or arrests for driving while disqualified (as stated, additional powers were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, allowing the arrest of people, who drive while disqualified, under section 6(b) and (c) of the Road Traffic Act 2014), as this would necessitate a manual trawl of all relevant incidents recorded on PULSE to collate same, which would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources. </p><p>Further, I have been advised by the Courts Service that the below table displays persons before the courts and persons convicted for the years 2018, 2019 &amp;amp; 2020 for Driving without a Driving Licence &amp;amp; Driving without holding a driving licence. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of Persons before the Courts</th>       <th>No. of Persons convicted</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>16,835</td>       <td>3,544</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>17,713</td>       <td>3,528</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>11,080</td>       <td>2,039</td>    </tr> </table> <i>The statistics that the Courts Service produce in relation to specific offences are based on running a report on CCTS against the code for each specific offence.

The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of dogs. A maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment is provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.</p><p>The Minister of State with responsibility for Law Reform, James Browne TD, has a strong interest in this issue. Earlier last year, the Bills office approved his own draft Private Member's Bill to strengthen the place of companion pets in legislation. Officials in the Department of Justice have been asked to review this draft legislation and the Minister is in the process of considering their observations.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that approximately 205 domestic dogs and/or pets were reported stolen to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019. 244 dogs were reported stolen for 2020, an increase of 16%. I am advised that these figures are approximate as they are based on descriptions given on the PULSE system.</p><p>With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am further informed that information has  been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe. Some of this information can be viewed online at </p><p>Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to travelling criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas.</p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent):</p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report and NCPE recommendations concerning Dupilumab were reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of the commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Health Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the HSE Drugs Group, having reviewed the above representations at their January 2021 meeting, supported reimbursement of Dupilumab for a defined subgroup of the full licensed indication. The Drugs Group recommendations have been progressed to the HSE EMT. </p>  <p>  The HSE EMT will consider the HSE Drugs Group's recommendations and the applicant&rsquo;s representations before making a final decision on whether Dupilumab will be approved for reimbursement, in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

This guidance, which includes protocols relating to the management of close contacts, is available at </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that schools must have a Covid-19 Response Plan and a Covid policy in place.  Up-to-date Government advice and resources for schools, parents and students in the context of COVID-19, including advice on Covid-19 planning is published at .</p><p>Where a school is informed of a pupil or staff member who has tested positive for Covid-19, if the case was in the school during the infectious period, the HSE endeavour to contact school management the same day, although this may be the following day in some cases. When public health doctors make contact with the school, they will proceed to undertake a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA). Core to the PHRA will be assessing the likelihood of onward transmission from the case identified, and this will inform their further actions.  The risk assessment applied in school settings may be dynamic and change as new information becomes available, and the testing strategy may evolve as information unfolds. </p><p>The Public Health advice remains that a confirmed case, anyone awaiting the result of a test and close contacts of confirmed cases, should restrict their movements and follow the advice provided by the HSE which is available at www.hse.ie. Restricting your movements means staying at home as much as possible to avoid contact with other people, avoiding social situations and staying at home or in your accommodation, as much as possible.</p><p>Should persons have concerns over a confirmed case not adhering to the Public Health advice to restrict movement, this can be reported to the relevant HSE Department of Public Health, who can take appropriate action under the provisions of the Health Act 1947, as amended. Contact details for the HSE's regional Departments of Public Health are available on the HSE website. </p></reply>

This Directive represents an important step towards achieving the final goal of full replacement of procedures on live animals for scientific and educational purposes as soon as it is scientifically possible to do so. Accordingly, and in line with the EU legislation, my Department is not considering a plan to prohibit the use of animals for scientific purposes.</p><p>The restrictions and standards set by the Directive aim to enhance animal welfare and ensure that animals are used in studies only when their use is strongly justified and following independent assessment. The Directive firmly anchors in EU Legislation the 3Rs principles, i.e. Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for the authorisation of studies using animals for scientific purposes. My Department does not maintain records of establishments.  In accordance with the legislation, the HPRA authorises and inspects the establishments where studies are conducted, and therefore has records of all such establishments.</p><p>In 2019, the HPRA performed 31 inspections, of which 32% were unannounced. The HPRA was satisfied with overall levels of compliance nationally.</p><p>There are four classifications of severity of procedures in the Directive which are &lsquo;non-recovery&rsquo;, &lsquo;mild&rsquo;, &lsquo;moderate&rsquo;, or &lsquo;severe&rsquo;. Over the two-year period from 2017 to 2019, the percentage of animals reported as experiencing an actual severity of severe has reduced from 29% to 13%, which in absolute terms represents a decrease in the numbers of animals experiencing severe severity from 70,596 in 2017 to 18,550 in 2019.  The reduction in the proportion of procedures reported as severe is attributed to the reduction in regulatory use of animals, as well as efforts made by the HPRA, animal welfare bodies, and animal users, to reduce the severity of procedures through the implementation of refinements and earlier humane endpoints.</p><p>In accordance with the requirements of the Directive and national legislation, the details of all projects are publicly available in the non-technical project summary reports on the HPRA website.  Annual statistical reports are also available on the HPRA website  ().</p><p>My Department provides funding to the Health Research Board (HRB).  The HRB has advised that out of a total of 725 HRB funded applications since 2016, less than 1% include animal work. The HRB has significantly reduced the amount of funding for animal research over the years by limiting eligibility for animal research only to specific cases.</p><p>In addition, the HRB expect researchers to adhere to the general principles and best practice outlined in the guidance provided by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  The HRB has also worked with Science Europe and other like-minded funders and stakeholders across Europe to reaffirm its commitment to ensuring responsible research involving animals.</p></reply>

The highest priority groups, those over the age of 65 living in long-term care facilities and frontline healthcare workers in direct patient contact, will receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.This is wholly dependent on supply lines and on candidate vaccines obtaining approval.  Therefore, it is not possible at this time to determine a timeframe for the full vaccination programme.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Allocation Strategy can be found at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

New systems are required to accommodate it as a basic requirement during procurement and decisions with regard to which legacy systems should have it retrofitted versus those that will be retired are made on a case by case basis.  The sequencing of the candidate health systems that will be populated with the IHI is determined by criteria such as that relating to clinical benefit resulting from the interaction of those systems with IHI included. Opportunities also arise for candidate system to be populated with IHI and the HSE are mindful of leveraging those opportunities.</p>  <p>  Since May 2016, all electronic referrals from GP practice management systems to hospitals have been populated with IHI's provided the referral includes sufficient data to enable IHI matching. The IHI has been seeded into a number of Health Service Systems including PCRS. GP Practice systems have been upgraded to accommodate the IHI and PCRS plan to include the IHI in the monthly file that issues to each practice for all patients covered by medical cards and GP visit cards.  Data matching analysis has been completed for 16.7 million Health Service System records including the National Medical Laboratory Information System (MedLIS), the National Cancer Screening Service, Immunisation and a number of Acute Hospital Patient Administration (PAS) systems.</p>  <p>  Arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the IHI was rapidly deployed for the Covid Case Tracker and has been included on all Covid-19 referrals for tests or assessments. While the Covid-19 pandemic suspended the planned 2020 roll-out of IHI to national systems, IHI will be implemented as a matter of priority in the context of Covid vaccinations and the national Covid Vaccination System in 2021. The objective is that all Covid vaccination records will contain a unique ID for each person who receives the vaccine, and that ID will be the IHI.</p>  <p>  The IHI has been critical in the management of Covid as it enables unique identification of the patient across all events and health records relating to the individual along the Covid Care pathway. This means that clinical interactions can be tracked, linked and audited and diagnostic outcomes can be returned to the correct individual and clinicians managing that individuals care. The IHI also provides access to all information required in relation to contacting the individual for contact tracing, scheduling care and communicating results.</p></reply>

In this regard a High-Level Taskforce was established to support and oversee the development and implementation of the programme.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce membership is made up of senior personnel from my Department, the Health Service Executive, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach, as well as expertise in the areas of public health, supply chain logistics, cold chain logistics, and programme management. The Defence Forces are also represented.</p>  <p>  The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p>  <p>  The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p>  <p>  Over time there will be enough vaccine available to vaccinate all those who want it. We are planning to vaccinate as many people within our population, with approved vaccines, as quickly, safely, and effectively as possible.</p>  <p>  Training is now available to all relevant staff and being completed on a daily rolling basis to build up the number of vaccinators.  Over 4,000 staff have received training to operate as vaccinators, and workforce planning for vaccinators to enable scale-up is currently underway. Pharmacists, GPs, doctors, nurses, paramedics, and many healthcare professionals, will have a role to play in the vaccination programme.</p></reply>

As their skills were identified as being required during the COVID-19 response and subject to the needs of each acute hospital, they were offered a temporary 3 month assistant radiographer role following successful completion of their 7 week final year clinical placement. The 3-month period commenced on 18 May 2020. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that across the health and social care disciplines, there could be over 8,000 students on placement in hospital and healthcare settings.  Of this number, around a third are final year students.  The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements vary between the disciplines. These students are not employees and in many cases the nature of the placement can, in the main, be limited to participation in an observing and a learning capacity.</p>  <p>  Uniquely for student nurses and midwives there is, in the final year, a paid salary when they are specifically employed on an internship placement. Student nurses and midwives&rsquo; final year internship placement consists of a continual 36-week rostered clinical placement, including annual leave. The internship placement is a paid placement as the student nurses and midwives take a reduced caseload. During these placements, students are under supervision and are considered as 0.5 WTE of the workforce. In addition, Intern students can be allocated across all shift patterns including nights, weekends and 12-hour days.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives undertaking unpaid supernumerary clinical placement as students are currently in receipt of an allowance. Again, given the unique requirements of these training programmes attendance at many placement sites is required, some of which are at a distance to base training hospital and the current allowance is to contribute to the cost of alternative accommodation / travel.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family farms or family businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in the case of sudden illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family owned and operated farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  Under the current public health measures in place for Covid-19 live music is not permitted at weddings.  It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), by my Department and by the Government .

Of this number, around a third are final year students.  The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements vary between the disciplines. These students are not employees and in many cases the nature of the placement can, in the main, be limited to participation in an observing and a learning capacity.</p>  <p>  In radiography departments, I can confirm that, during last year, assistant radiographers were employed on a 3 month contract following completion of their final year clinical placement, subject to the needs of the Health Service.  As their skills were identified as being required during the COVID-19 response and subject to the needs of each acute hospital, they were offered a temporary 3 month assistant radiographer role following successful completion of their 7 week final year clinical placement. The 3-month period commenced on 18 May 2020. </p>  <p>  In relation to nursing, uniquely for student nurses and midwives there is, in the final year, a paid salary when they are specifically employed on an internship placement. Student nurses and midwives&rsquo; final year internship placement consists of a continual 36-week rostered clinical placement, including annual leave. The internship placement is a paid placement as the student nurses and midwives take a reduced caseload. During these placements, students are under supervision and are considered as 0.5 WTE of the workforce. In addition, Intern students can be allocated across all shift patterns including nights, weekends and 12-hour days.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives undertaking unpaid supernumerary clinical placement as students are currently in receipt of an allowance. Again, given the unique requirements of these training programmes attendance at many placement sites is required, some of which are at a distance to base training hospital and the current allowance is to contribute to the cost of alternative accommodation/travel.  </p></reply>

On 18 September 2020, the NCPE completed its assessment and recommended that Voretigene neparvovec not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report will be reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations which took place in November 2020 and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE advises that Voretigene neparvovec is expected to be included on a Drugs Group agenda in early 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE Executive Management Team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Voretigene neparvovec will be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I have received representations in relation to this reimbursement application, including statements in relation to the early administration of this medicine.

Anybody in this situation should behave as if they have the virus. People awaiting a test or waiting for the results of a test should self-isolate. </p><p>Persons who are close contacts of a confirmed case should restrict their movements for 14 days. A test, regardless of the result, does not change this guidance. </p><p>The guidance also describes the circumstances in which people can stop self-isolating. For a confirmed case, this is when you have had no fever for 5 days and it has been 10 days since you first developed symptoms. If you are a close contact and do not have any symptoms, you should continue to restrict your movements for 14 days. Do this from the last date you were in contact with the person who tested positive for COVID-19. If you&rsquo;re not sure when that was, restrict your movements until the date you were told by the contact tracing team. </p><p>It is important to note that testing for Covid-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus was below detectable levels at the time of the test. This is why a test result does not change the guidance.</p><p>The HSE only accepts PCR tests for diagnosing COVID-19. This is the most reliable way of testing.</p></reply>

This group works together to identify potential solutions to any issues or risks arising and make follow up reports as appropriate.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-20a.1511.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012000101#WRKK01300"><p>Central to the evolution of NPHET processes is the recognition that health and social care services, and indeed the wider cross-government COVID-19 response, have to become embedded and &lsquo;mainstreamed&rsquo; in the usual operational response of organisations, as society adapts to the reality of living for the foreseeable future in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>In July 2020, as part of a process examining the work of all the subgroups of the NPHET, it was deemed that the Subgroup on Vulnerable Persons had met its Terms of Reference regarding preparedness plans being in place across government for vulnerable groups, and accordingly, it was stood down. The associated ongoing work was realigned into the appropriate policy and operational functions of the Department of Health or other relevant Departments, organisations, or bodies.</p><p>Recognising that vulnerable groups can be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and as set out in <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19,</i>the Department of the Taoiseach has convened a Senior Official Group and sub-groups as needed, to drive implementation of the Plan. This includes a Sub-group on higher risk groups to monitor the spectrum of issues that need to be addressed in relation to groups at higher risk of COVID-19. These groups support the COVID-19 Oversight Group and the Cabinet Committee on the Government Response to COVID-19. The Subgroup on higher risk groups meets on a regular basis. </p><p>As part of the work of the Sub-group, relevant Departments have reviewed the oversight, management and reporting structures; guidance; mitigation plans; and communications structures in place for the various higher-risk groups. </p><p>The Departments represented on the Sub-group are responsible for the on-going monitoring of the epidemiological data and of any outbreaks in higher risk groups within their remit based on the Weekly Report prepared by the HPSC on Outbreaks/Clusters and sectoral information systems/knowledge. Upon the Sub-group&rsquo;s establishment, Departments were also requested to ensure that they have early warning systems in place for their relevant sectors and groups to deal with emerging issues. Sectoral-specific actions are led by the relevant Departments. There is ongoing bilateral contact between the Department of the Taoiseach and Sub-group members to monitor the situation. The COVID-19 Oversight group is kept informed where additional cross-government measures are required. Persons with disabilities are represented on the Subgroup for higher risk groups through Department of Health officials. Interaction with groups and persons who represent those with disabilities takes place both through the Department of Health and the HSE. </p><p>In line with the above mechanism, the Department of Health monitors the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups on an ongoing basis based on reports provided by the HSE so as to identify, at an early stage, any issues or risks arising in relation to the COVID-19 impact on these groups. Regular bilateral engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of the Taoiseach through the cross-government mechanism for higher risk groups ensures the communication of relevant information in respect of outbreak control for nursing homes, the disability and mental health sectors, and in respect of drug and alcohol services. In addition to this ongoing monitoring, HSE Disabilities engage with the disability umbrella representative bodies on a frequent basis. Central to this joint effort is to ensure essential communication and joint working that delivers agreed measures to assist and support people with a disability, their families, and their communities. </p><p>The HSE Disabilities team created bespoke guidance for the sector arising from issues regarding the rights of disabled people due to restrictions, the specific needs of disabled people, and separate guidance was issued in relation to visiting in small group homes in the community. These guidance documents were developed following international research and intensive consultation with disabled people and the people who support them. </p><p>On 6th January last, the HSE issued revised guidance measures for Disability Services in the context of current high levels of COVID-19 transmission rates in the community. The revised guidance reflects Government&rsquo;s intention that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to evolving public health guidance. The recent guidance is available at: .</p><p>Service providers have been asked not to take unilateral action in relation to the provision of services and to ensure that robust communications plans are put in place to ensure that each service user and their families have a clear understanding of services to be provided during this current phase.</p><p>The Department, the HSE, and the HIQA will continue interagency collaboration, working together to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on those living with a disability and mitigate against associated risks. The Department of Health has and will continue to apprise the NPHET on vulnerable group issues on a regular basis. </p><p>I trust that the above information addresses the Deputy&rsquo;s question satisfactorily. </p></reply>

These matters were discussed most recently at its meeting of 14th January. </p><p>COVID-19 is a new disease, and the effect of ventilation on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is still unclear, however there is evidence that COVID-19 outbreaks are more commonly associated with crowded indoor spaces, and that poor ventilation may increase the risk of transmission in such settings.</p><p>There is already a range of advice and guidance in place in relation to ventilation. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has published <i>Guidance on Non-Healthcare Building Ventilation during COVID-19 </i>which provides an analysis of the current literature examining the association between ventilation and COVID-19. The Guidance provides recommendations, based on the literature, for commercial and public buildings, including with regard to mechanical ventilation. It also includes school specific guidance which recommends the use of indoor air quality meters which monitor the level of CO2 in classrooms that rely on natural ventilation. This guidance can be found at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The HPSC is currently reviewing this guidance based on a recent HIQA rapid review of current public health guidance for community settings for COVID-19 and recent updates in similar international guidance, and it is expected that the updated guidance will be published soon.</p><p>Additional guidance on ventilation in commercial spaces is available in the Work Safely Protocol <i>(</i><b><i>)</i></b>and in NSAI guidance for the retail sector and shopping centres: </p><p><i>  </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>There is also additional guidance on Gov.ie and on the HSE website which outlines the importance of ventilation in households, this can be found here: </p><p><i> </i></p><p><i> </i></p></reply>

The key target identified in the Plan is to increase the number of people taking regular exercise by 1% per annum over the lifetime of the Plan, to be achieved by making physical activity a normal part of everyday life and giving people more opportunities to be active. </p><p>The goal is to create an environment where everybody lives, works and plays in a society that facilitates, promotes and supports physical activity and an active way of life, with less time spent being sedentary. </p><p>The <i>NPAP</i>has a wide scope, including action areas that address public communication, children and young people, health, the environment (both natural and built), workplaces, community sport and physical activity and research, monitoring and evaluation. These action areas have been implemented through partnership with a wide range of stakeholders from across the various sectors and significant progress has been made.</p><p>Key achievements to date include:</p><p>- Incorporation of physical activity as a key element of the Healthy Ireland National Communications Campaigns, including the current <i>Keep Well </i>campaign aimed at supporting resilience in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic;</p><p>- Supporting the Department of Education in the provision of physical activity and physical education in schools, including support for the Active School Flag programme; </p><p>- Establishment of the Healthy Ireland Fund, which provides significant supports for sport and physical activity initiatives and has a focus on supporting measures aimed at disadvantaged groups or communities, children and young families;</p><p>- Extension of the number of Community Sport and Physical Activity Hubs;</p><p>- Continued expansion of community walking groups under the <i>Get Ireland Walking Strategy</i>;</p><p>- Engagement with key stakeholders to progress actions aimed at increasing national participation in physical activity, including support for the European Week Of Sport in September every year;</p><p>- Co-ordination and implementation of the aims and objectives of the <i>NPAP</i>with the <i>National Sports Policy 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>;</p><p>- Progressing research into effective physical activity interventions, both through the Research Sub-Group and on an all-island basis through the Irish Physical Activity Research Collaboration (iPARC); </p><p>- Monitoring levels of physical activity, both for use in domestic policy development and to meet our international reporting requirements, through the Irish Sports Monitor, the Healthy Ireland Survey, the all-island Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study and the international Health Behaviours in School-Aged Children Study; </p><p>- Considering the role of the environment, both built and natural, in enabling and promoting physical activity (a Stakeholder Forum on this topic was held in late 2018).  </p><p>It had been intended to conduct a review of the current NPAP in 2020; however, this was delayed as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group has therefore formally agreed that the policy will be extended to the end of 2021 and a review will take place in 2021. </p><p>Significant progress has been made on almost all of the 60 actions within the defined timeframes; more details will be available through the 2019 NPAP Progress Report, which will be published shortly. </p><p>Whilst many of the actions can be deemed to be completed, further progress will continue to be made pursuant to ongoing actions, past the target dates set out in the original plan. The proposed review will identify any outstanding actions which may need to be redefined or progressed further. It is intended that the Review will also include recommendations regarding refreshing, renewing or extending the National Physical Activity Plan for the years ahead.</p></reply>

The National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group (NPAP IG) has a Research Sub-Group that has been involved in oversight of NPAP related research, including compilation of Irish data for the WHO 2018 Country FactSheets on Physical Activity and the WHO Health Enhancing Physical Activity Policy Action Tool (HEPA PAT) for Ireland. Research and EU engagement are also key elements of implementation of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.</p><p>The Irish Physical Activity Research Collaboration (iPARC), an HRB funded, all-island initiative led by researchers at the University of Limerick and the Department of Health and also including representation from the Departments of Education and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the HSE and Sport Ireland, the HSC in Northern Ireland and researchers at Ulster University, Waterford Institute of Technology, University College, Dublin and a panel of international experts drawn from the UK, Netherlands and Australia.</p><p>At the January 2021 iPARC conference, University of Limerick researchers presented the findings of a study which found that COVID-19 restrictions were both a barrier to, and an opportunity for, physical activity in teenagers. 50% of adolescents surveyed reported engaging in less physical activity following the introduction of necessary Covid-19 restrictions; 30% reported no change in activity levels, while 20% reported more engagement. The research concluded that parents, schools, public health, communities and industries must collaborate to prevent physical inactivity at times of crisis, especially for vulnerable groups.</p><p>Further international research was also presented at the conference in the context of the pandemic, highlighting the positive effects of regular physical activity on immune function and vaccine responses, and on reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. </p><p>Bearing in mind the diverse positive health impacts of physical activity, Healthy Ireland initiatives have continued to take place where possible and have been adapted in line with the necessary restrictions in place at any given point in time. Healthy eating and physical activity continue to be promoted as key elements of the current <i>Keep Well</i>campaign, which promotes population resilience during this challenging winter period. Links to online resources for healthy eating and physical activity for families, children and adolescents are available through various websites, including Healthy Ireland, Sport Ireland and at local level, Local Sports Partnerships.</p><p>The START communications campaign was launched in 2017 in both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The campaign aims to help families take that first step and then continue ongoing steps towards a healthier lifestyle for their children.  Post-campaign evaluation (2017, 2018 and 2019) includes data on consumption of various food groups during the weekdays and on weekends. The evaluation data from 2020 will be available in February 2021, which will add to the data on eating behaviours of children during the COVID 19 pandemic.</p><p>Healthy Ireland co-sponsors the Active School Flag (ASF) programme, which is led by the Department of Education. When schools were closed in March 2020, Active School Week 2020 was converted to Active Home Week, with extensive resources for use by parents at home, and was very well received. The Active School Flag Programme incorporates research and evaluation; a recent article published by a DCU research team has identified positive effects of the ASF programme on physical activity participation, behaviour and attendance in DEIS schools holding a Flag and participating in the research. Research and evaluation is also built in to the development of the ASF Post Primary pilot programme, working with researchers at the University of Limerick. </p><p>The Healthy Ireland Demonstration Project (HIDP), led by the HSE Clinical Lead for Obesity and researchers at the University of Limerick, is examining physical activity and healthy eating in the context of post-primary schools. School closures have had significant impacts on the research programme, however, students from 7 post primary schools are being tracked as part of ASF and HIDP efforts to measure the impact of COVID-19 on health behaviours in adolescents. </p><p>Ireland is a participant in the Big O European study on childhood obesity, which continued to recruit participants and to collect data throughout 2020. A study is underway to explore changes in activity and eating behaviour between 2018/2019 and 2020.  </p><p>Healthy Ireland supports and participates in oversight of a number of Surveys. The Healthy Ireland Survey takes a representative sample of people aged 15 and over, resident in Ireland; Wave 7 is currently in the field and includes questions relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>Sport Ireland have been tracking engagement in sport and physical activity in those aged 16 and over since the start of the pandemic; the results of this research are published on their website: <i>www.sportireland.ie</i></p><p>The National COVID-19 Food Study, carried out by University College Dublin and Dublin City University was an online survey of adults, but many of those completing the questionnaire were parents of young children, and some reported difficulties feeding their families due to financial strain and the absence of school meals during school closures.  In recognition of these difficulties, funding for the School Meals Scheme, which already prioritised DEIS schools, was maintained during the school closures and also through the summer of 2020.  An ESRI Report found that over 95% of DEIS schools continued to participate in the scheme, which is also being maintained during the current school closures.</p></reply>

Residential &amp;amp; PA/home support: Residential and home support/ personal assistant services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction.</p><p>2.  Respite Services: People with complex medical/clinical needs are to remain at home and will receive home support where possible, subject to risk assessment and prioritisation criteria.  </p><p>3.

Services will continue to be provided either remotely or face to face as appropriate during the current COVID-19 restrictions. The provision of Assessments of Need under the Disability Act continues to be a priority and each CHO area will continue to evaluate their plans on an on-going basis. </p><p>4.  Adult Day Services: Extra funding has been provided to build capacity in buildings and to provide extra staff. This will ensure that maximum services will continue at a scale so that they can be provided safely to those most in need. Day services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction. People with complex medical/ clinical related needs are to remain at home and, where possible to receive the same number of hours support in the home as they had been in receipt of pre-Christmas in day service locations. Providers have been asked to reduce contacts via hubs/bubbles, with dedicated staff for dedicated service users, where possible. Where families are uncomfortable with allowing their family member to return to a day service location, a package of support within available resources will be agreed with the service user and family. </p><p>The full guidance is available on the HSE website at: </p><p>With regard to the redeployment of staff, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.</p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Report</i>. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services by the end of 2021. Work planned in 2020, including the planned testing of a reformed model of service delivery, was adversely affected due to the impact of COVID-19 on delivery mechanisms for home support and the requirement for the diversion of resources to deal with COVID-19.  This has had an impact on the final timeline. </p><p>The successful development of this scheme is an ambitious programme of reform and is a key priority for me and the Minister for Health.  In order to accelerate this work, the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that the required resourcing including personnel, governance structures and other requisite resources are scaled up to ensure that significant progress is achieved by the end of 2021.</p><p>Within this context funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll out of InterRAI as the standard assessment for care needs in the community, the testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home support services and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.  All the work throughout 2021 will progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme. </p><p>In parallel, the increased investment in home support services in 2021 will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home care. </p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  Liraglutide does not currently have a marketing authorisation for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. If marketing authorisation is granted for an indication covering this illness, the HSE will be open to receiving an application for its reimbursement from the marketing authorisation holder.</p>  <p>  Liraglutide marketed as Victoza was approved by the HSE for addition to the Reimbursement List for the treatment of Diabetes. Diabetes is one of the Long-Term Illness conditions for which eligible LTI persons can access their medicines free of charge.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it subsequently received an application for the reimbursement of Liraglutide marketed as Saxenda indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients.</p>  <p>  On 29 October 2019, in line with agreed processes, the HSE commissioned a full pharmacoeconomic assessment with respect to this indication following the completion by the NCPE of a rapid review.</p>  <p>  On 8 July 2020, the NCPE received the applicant&rsquo;s submission for this assessment and the HTA is currently under way. The application remains under consideration with the HSE and a decision will be made in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The Long-Term Illness Scheme (LTI) was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  Polycystic ovary syndrome is not included on the above list and there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-20a.1648.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012000105#WROO02200"><p>Central to the evolution of NPHET processes is the recognition that health and social care services, and indeed the wider cross-government COVID-19 response, have to become embedded and &lsquo;mainstreamed&rsquo; in the usual operational response of organisations, as society adapts to the reality of living for the foreseeable future in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In July 2020, as part of a process examining the work of all the subgroups of the NPHET, it was deemed that the Subgroup on Vulnerable Persons had met its Terms of Reference regarding preparedness plans being in place across government for vulnerable groups, and accordingly, it was stood down. The associated ongoing work was realigned into the appropriate policy and operational functions of the Department of Health or other relevant Departments, organisations, or bodies.</p><p>Recognising that vulnerable groups can be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and as set out in Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, the Department of the Taoiseach has convened a Senior Official Group and sub-groups as needed, to drive implementation of the Plan. This includes a Sub-group on higher risk groups to monitor the spectrum of issues that need to be addressed in relation to groups at higher risk of COVID-19. These groups support the COVID-19 Oversight Group and the Cabinet Committee on the Government Response to COVID-19. The Subgroup on higher risk groups meets on a regular basis.</p><p>As part of the work of the Sub-group, relevant Departments have reviewed the oversight, management and reporting structures; guidance; mitigation plans; and communications structures in place for the various higher-risk groups.</p><p>The Departments represented on the Sub-group are responsible for the on-going monitoring of the epidemiological data and of any outbreaks in higher risk groups within their remit based on the Weekly Report prepared by the HPSC on Outbreaks/Clusters and sectoral information systems/knowledge. Upon the Sub-group&rsquo;s establishment, Departments were also requested to ensure that they have early warning systems in place for their relevant sectors and groups to deal with emerging issues. Sectoral-specific actions are led by the relevant Departments. There is ongoing bilateral contact between the Department of the Taoiseach and Sub-group members to monitor the situation. The COVID-19 Oversight group is kept informed where additional cross-government measures are required. Persons with disabilities are represented on the Subgroup for higher risk groups through Department of Health officials. Interaction with groups and persons who represent those with disabilities takes place both through the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>In line with the above mechanism, the Department of Health monitors the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups on an ongoing basis based on reports provided by the HSE so as to identify, at an early stage, any issues or risks arising in relation to the COVID-19 impact on these groups. Regular bilateral engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of the Taoiseach through the cross-government mechanism for higher risk groups ensures the communication of relevant information in respect of outbreak control for nursing homes, the disability and mental health sectors, and in respect of drug and alcohol services. In addition to this ongoing monitoring, HSE Disabilities engage with the disability umbrella representative bodies on a frequent basis. Central to this joint effort is to ensure essential communication and joint working that delivers agreed measures to assist and support people with a disability, their families, and their communities.</p><p>The HSE Disabilities team created bespoke guidance for the sector arising from issues regarding the rights of disabled people due to restrictions, the specific needs of disabled people, and separate guidance was issued in relation to visiting in small group homes in the community. These guidance documents were developed following international research and intensive consultation with disabled people and the people who support them.</p><p>On 6th January last, the HSE issued revised guidance measures for Disability Services in the context of current high levels of COVID-19 transmission rates in the community. The revised guidance reflects Government&rsquo;s intention that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to evolving public health guidance. The recent guidance is available at:<i> </i></p><p>Service providers have been asked not to take unilateral action in relation to the provision of services and to ensure that robust communications plans are put in place to ensure that each service user and their families have a clear understanding of services to be provided during this current phase.</p><p>The Department, the HSE, and the HIQA will continue interagency collaboration, working together to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on those living with a disability and mitigate against associated risks. The Department of Health has and will continue to apprise the NPHET on vulnerable group issues on a regular basis.</p><p>I trust that the above information addresses the Deputy&rsquo;s question satisfactorily.</p></reply>

The highest priority groups, those over the age of 65 living in long-term care facilities and frontline healthcare workers in direct patient contact, will receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.This is wholly dependent on supply lines and on candidate vaccines obtaining approval.  Therefore, it is not possible at this time to determine a timeframe for the full vaccination programme.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Allocation Strategy can be found at:</p><p>  .</p><p>Vaccine administration figures are now being added to Ireland's COVID-19 Data Hub.</p><p>  </p><p>The HSE will move to daily reporting from January 25.

The revised guidance reflects Government&rsquo;s intention that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to evolving public health guidance.</p><p>Service providers have been asked not to take unilateral action in relation to the provision of services and to ensure that robust communications plan are put in place to ensure that each service user and their families have a clear understanding of services to be provided during this current phase.</p><p>The following guidance is under continuing review and will be guided by Public Health advice: </p><p>1.  Residential &amp;amp; PA/home support: Residential and home support/ personal assistant services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction. </p><p>2.  Respite Services: People with complex medical/clinical needs are to remain at home and will receive home support where possible, subject to risk assessment and prioritisation criteria. </p><p>3.  Children&rsquo;s Services: Therapy services for children with disabilities have been identified as &ldquo;Level 1&rdquo; in the HSE business continuity plan.  Services will continue to be provided either remotely or face to face as appropriate during the current COVID-19 restrictions. The provision of Assessments of Need under the Disability Act continues to be a priority and each CHO area will continue to evaluate their plans on an on-going basis. </p><p>4.  Adult Day Services: Extra funding has been provided to build capacity in buildings and to provide extra staff. This will ensure that maximum services will continue at a scale so that they can be provided safely to those most in need. Day services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction. People with complex medical/ clinical related needs are to remain at home and, where possible to receive the same number of hours support in the home as they had been in receipt of pre-Christmas in day service locations. Providers have been asked to reduce contacts via hubs/bubbles, with dedicated staff for dedicated service users, where possible. Where families are uncomfortable with allowing their family member to return to a day service location, a package of support within available resources will be agreed with the service user and family. </p><p>The full guidance is available on the HSE website at: </p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

This allows for follow up and monitoring of any adverse events. The HSE is planning for the production of Vaccine certificates at part of its implementation planning for a Covid 19 vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  Immunity passports are problematic on a number of grounds. It is not yet clear if the proposed vaccines for Covid 19 actually stop people getting the virus. It is also not clear whether the thresholds for protective immunity are the same in all groups e.g. older persons or those who are immunosuppressed. Thus, it is premature to discuss immunity passports due to the many uncertainties that still exist regarding immunity against the novel corona virus. The WHO has cautioned Governments against introducing immunity passports at this time and has advised that the focus should be on vaccine certificates.</p></reply>

The new service will come on-stream in 2021, following completion of the Equipping and Commissioning stages, and the transfer of the existing service at Dundrum.</p><p>Construction of the facility at Portrane is not dependent on the sale of the Dundrum site.  This site is owned by the Commissioner for Public Works, rather than the HSE.  A new Dundrum Central Development is to be located on the site of the existing Central Mental Hospital, following its relocation to Portrane.  This will be progressed by the Land Development Agency, which co-ordinates land within State control for optimal uses, as appropriate, with a focus on providing housing. In this context, the Exchequer will benefit from the sale of the facility at Dundrum.</p><p>While <i>A Vision for Change (AVFC)</i>, which was launched in 2006, reflected an aspiration to re-invest where possible in the mental health care programme from funding accrued from the sale of mental health lands, this was subsequently influenced by various factors.  In May 2006, following publication of AVFC, there was a Government decision that proceeds from the sale of older mental health assets, such as the Dundrum site, will be reinvested in new developments within health. Funding for the new NFMHS capital project at Portrane was facilitated by the significant additional funding given to mental health over recent years. </p><p>Budget 2021 saw an additional &euro;50 million allocated to Mental Health Services, bringing the total 2021 mental health budget to &euro;1,076 billion, which is the biggest mental health budget on record. This represents an increase of over &euro;365 million (51%) since 2012. The Government is committed to further development of all aspects of our mental health services, in line with our current policy <i>Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for All. </i></p></reply>

As international evidence shows, the higher the rate of community transmission, the greater the risk to settings like nursing homes.  Across the health and social care system the rate of COVID-19 transmission is having a significant impact on the availability of staff.  The HSE continues to provide PPE and other necessary supports to nursing homes across the country to help prevent and control outbreaks of COVID-19. This includes staffing support, advice, and financial support through the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, which has provided over &euro;60 million to nursing homes across the country to help improve their ability to respond to COVID-19.

It is often the case that gambling addiction is one of a number of addictions and issues faced by an individual. </p><p>Although some cases of problematic gambling have been provided with treatment, services have not been funded to develop a programme of intervention for problematic gambling.  </p><p>To provide additional services for gambling addiction would result in significant capacity issues and lengthening of existing waiting lists for people with drug and alcohol problems. </p><p>The HSE provides funding to a number of voluntary sector providers who treat gambling addiction, along with drug and alcohol addictions. I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy with details of funded addiction support services that also provide support with gambling addiction. </p><p>With respect to the organisation referred by the Deputy, I understand that this organisation provides support for individuals affected by problem gambling.  The mission of the organisation is to provide a dedicated, independent suite of supports, resources and referral pathways for problem gamblers and their families. It also advocates on behalf of those suffering the consequences of problem gambling and highlights gambling related issues in the media.</p><p>I am aware that problem gambling affects a number of individuals and families in Ireland. Research conducted by Ipsos on behalf of the Department of Justice estimates that circa 1 per cent of the population is affected by problem gambling. </p><p>While I am supportive of drug and alcohol services that assist people with problem gambling, the Department has no funding available to it to support organisations that deal only with gambling addiction or problem gamblers. </p><p>The Department of Justice has overall responsibility for gambling regulation.  It published the Inter-Departmental Working Group Report on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling in 2019.</p><p>The report addresses the social impact of gambling, including the issue of problem gambling.  It notes the social and health impacts of problem gambling and acknowledges that problem gambling can lead to social breakdown, with devastating financial losses and alienation of family and friends.  Problem gambling can be associated with a range of harms including higher risk of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug misuse, physical and mental health issues, separation and divorce, unemployment and insolvency.</p><p>The Inter-Departmental Working Group recommended that:</p><p>- funding be made available for research, training, and community interventions into treatment of gambling addiction.</p><p>- funding of public education and awareness raising programmes and the production of relevant information materials be supported.</p><p>- assistance be given in the provision of additional services to treat gambling addiction.</p><p>In order to meet these objectives, the Group recommended that a Social Fund, managed by the gambling regulatory authority should be established.</p><p>I support the recommendations of the working group report to address the social impact of gambling and to establish a social fund to support treatment services for gambling addiction.</p></reply>

Recently the Chief Medical Officers in Northern Ireland and Ireland collaborated on a joint statement voicing their concerns about the high levels of COVID-19 and urging everyone to stay home.</p>  <p>  Both administrations are seeking to adopt similar approaches, where it is appropriate to do so and on the advice of respective Chief Medical Officers. This approach is underpinned a Memorandum of Understanding agreed by the Chief Medical Officers of the Department of Health and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in April 2020 to strengthen North South co-operation on the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In November, this overarching agreement was supplemented with a further Memorandum of Understanding in relation to a framework for mutual support for the provision of critical care.</p>  <p>  Meetings of the North South Ministerial Council are also an important pillar in our regular engagements with Northern Ireland counterparts on COVID-19.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continue this close and productive cooperation with Northern Ireland to foster commonality in approaches, where possible, in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The objective of the group is to expand the statistical and mathematical modelling capacity available to NPHET, critically reviewing the emerging research, analysing and interpreting the national epidemiological data on the outbreak, using and adapting standard mathematical models of infectious disease, and parameterising and calibrating these to the national demographics and outbreak data. IEMAG are currently exploring how the impact of vaccinations will influence the parameters, including transmissibility, used in their models. The work is ongoing and based on emerging evidence in this area.</p><p>The group is chaired by Professor Philip Nolan and delivers an integrated and comprehensive programme of data analysis and modelling work. Membership comprises academics with expertise in epidemiology, public health, statistics, mathematics, computer science, and geospatial science, researchers from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), and expert colleagues from Health Service Executive (HSE), Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and others.</p><p>Technical notes on the approaches used by IEMAG are published on the Department of Health website ( ).</p></reply>

As part of the preparation for the introduction of the tax, a Department of Health Working Paper from October 2016 outlined the Health Rationale, Options and Recommendations in relation to the proposed tax.  This Working Paper found that a strong medical consensus supported the association between obesity and the consumption of sugar and sugar-sweetened drinks.  The paper reviewed the existing evidence in relation to &ldquo;free sugars&rdquo; and obesity and found that liquid carbohydrate, rather than in the solid form, contributes disproportionately to weight gain, and that the association between sugar-sweetened drink consumption and weight gain has been found to be stronger than for any other food or beverage.  The paper also highlighted that consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in early-life (from conception to five years of age) was a factor associated with later overweight and obesity.  The Working Paper also examined the increasing levels of consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks among children in Ireland, as evidenced by studies such as the Health Behaviours in School aged Children (HBSC) and National Children&rsquo;s Food Survey reports.  Additionally, the paper examined tooth decay and noted that there is consistent evidence that tooth decay is lower when sugar intake is low.</p><p>In addition, <i>safe</i>food has carried out a number of studies on Energy Drinks.  Its 2016 report &ldquo;Energy Drinks in Ireland &ndash; A Review&rdquo; referred to conclusions by the European Food Safety Authority that for children and adolescents, the information available is insufficient for calculating a safe level of caffeine intake.  The report also noted that caffeine consumption in children and adolescents has been reported to have a negative effect on neurological and cardiovascular systems and to create a physical dependence.  A 2019 UK study found that children who consume caffeinated energy drinks on a weekly basis are more likely to experience low psychological, physical and educational wellbeing than those who consume them less frequently.  In 2019 <i>safe</i>food carried out a further study &ldquo;A Survey of Energy Drinks on the Island of Ireland&rdquo; in the context of the introduction of the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax.</p><p><i>Safe</i>food also continues to keep under review the available data on the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks and on their health effects.  In 2020 <i>safe</i>food produced an evidence document reviewing the evidence from 2018 to 2020.  This noted reduced levels of consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, as evinced by the 2018 HBSC study published in 2020 and the National Children&rsquo;s Food Survey II published in 2019.  The document also referenced a number of recent international studies reiterating the negative health impacts of high levels of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.</p></reply>

The associated ongoing work was realigned into the appropriate policy and operational functions of the Department of Health or other relevant Departments, organisations, or bodies.</p><p>Recognising that vulnerable groups can be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and as set out in <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>, the Department of the Taoiseach has convened a Senior Official Group and sub-groups as needed, to drive implementation of the Plan. This includes a Sub-group on higher risk groups to monitor the spectrum of issues that need to be addressed in relation to groups at higher risk of COVID-19. These groups support the COVID-19 Oversight Group and the Cabinet Committee on the Government Response to COVID-19. The Subgroup on higher risk groups meets on a regular basis.</p><p>As part of the work of the Sub-group, relevant Departments have reviewed the oversight, management and reporting structures, guidance, mitigation plans, and communications structures in place for the various higher-risk groups.</p><p>The Departments represented on the Sub-group are responsible for the on-going monitoring of the epidemiological data and of any outbreaks in higher risk groups within their remit based on the Weekly Report prepared by the HPSC on Outbreaks/Clusters and sectoral information systems/knowledge. Upon the Sub-group&rsquo;s establishment, Departments were also requested to ensure that they have early warning systems in place for their relevant sectors and groups to deal with emerging issues. Sectoral-specific actions are led by the relevant Departments. There is ongoing bilateral contact between the Department of the Taoiseach and Sub-group members to monitor the situation. The COVID-19 Oversight group is kept informed where additional cross-government measures are required.</p><p>In line with the above mechanism, the Department of Health monitors the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups on an ongoing basis based on reports provided by the HSE so as to identify, at an early stage, any issues or risks arising in relation to the COVID-19 impact on these groups. Regular bilateral engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of the Taoiseach through the cross-government mechanism for higher risk groups ensures the communication of relevant information in respect of outbreak control for nursing homes, the disability and mental health sectors, and in respect of drug and alcohol services. In respect of mental health, a specific tripartite oversight group, comprising representatives from Department of Health, HSE, and the Mental Health Commission, is in place to monitor this sector. This group works together to identify potential solutions to any issues or risks arising and make follow up reports as appropriate. A number of other Government departments also report on higher risk groups, e.g. Traveller, Roma and homeless persons. This whole-of-Government approach ensures that emerging issues can be identified and acted upon.</p><p>The Department, the HSE, the HIQA, and the Mental Health Commission will continue interagency and interdepartmental collaboration, working together to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups and mitigate against associated risks.</p><p>I trust that the above information addresses the Deputy's question satisfactorily.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of the Covid-19 market disturbance.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019.</p>  <p>  Obligations under the measure were developed based on analysis of the herd profile and nitrates profile of the national herd.  It was designed, in consultation with farmer representative organisations, to make the measure as easy to participate in as possible, whilst maintaining the requirement under the implementing regulation for temporary market adjustments.</p>  <p>  Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some &euro;77.72M as part of the scheme.</p></reply>

The websites of 14 Departments are already hosted on this platform and the websites of the remaining Departments will be moved in the coming months.</p><p>The core principle of <i>gov.ie</i>is that information that the user needs is provided, in a way that is easily accessible. The objective is that users can be provided with all information relating to a particular topic without the need to search through the websites of different Departments. This model has been developed based around how the majority of customers seek on-line information. Specifically, rather than visit a front page and look for suitable links, users now typically enter their search into Google and are brought directly to the information they seek. The redesign emphasises the use of plain English for ease of accessibility. Brief summaries of schemes and services are available so that users can easily identify if the service is relevant to them and don&rsquo;t have to trawl through a substantial amount of material to determine this.</p><p><i>Gov.ie</i>has a particular format that all Departments must follow. This has involved a major redesign of our website to enable improved accessibility by all customers and to cater for different literacy levels, visual impairments and other accessibility issues. It is accepted that, for some users who are very familiar with the old website, it may take a while to get used to the improvements.</p><p>My Department emailed all approved Farm Advisory System (FAS) advisors on 27th November 2020 notifying them of the move to the new website and advising them specifically of the location of all schemes and Department online services. In relation to Nitrates, the Department emailed all FAS advisors, also on 27th November, providing the direct link to nitrates information. That information, including links to the forms, was also published in the press release of 4 December 2020.</p><p>It should be noted that forms in relation to 2021 schemes have not been published yet.</p></reply>

Access to sources of protein, including Soya for inclusion in concentrate feeds, is important for the Irish feed industry.</p>  <p>  In this respect, I understand that importers of feed materials are currently sourcing alternative short-term supplies of soya and other protein products. In the meantime, feed mills are also using alternative ingredients to ensure their products provide the required protein content.</p>  <p>  Exports of soya have now resumed and supplies are expected to return to normal levels over the next month or so.</p></reply>

It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and  to issue licences in the  volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy and to help achieve our environmental goals.</p>  <p>  You will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input in order to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year. This positive trend has continued into January.</p>  <p>  The total number of licences which issued in 2020 was 2,593. Over 4,300ha of new afforestation and 129km of forest roads were licensed. The total volume of felling licences issued for 2020 was just over 5 million cubic metres, of which almost 2m cubic metres representing 40% of annual output issued in the last quarter of the year. This positive trend is continuing this month, with 177 licences issued in the first two weeks of January, which includes timber volume of nearly 450,000 m3.  The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output and ensure the consistent high level of output that the sector needs.</p>  <p>  We have also implemented changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. This is an increase from one Committee that was previously in existence.  This is reforming how the FAC does its business and will result in a more fit-for-purpose, environmentally sensitive and sustainable forestry licensing process, which serves appellants and applicants alike, and will mean that land-owners receive more timely decisions on their licences.</p>  <p>  Of course, my Department also processes other support schemes including support for Ash Dieback. The national response to Ash Dieback has moved away from eradication of the disease in light of experience and scientific evidence that such an approach is no longer feasible. Previous reconstitutions scheme for ash dieback have cost in the region of &euro;7m.  A new Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) has been launched and focuses on ash plantation management. This approach categorises plantations into three groups based on the plantation age and tree size. Different support options are available, depending on the category into which the ash plantation may fall.</p>  <p>  To date, 195 applications for the scheme have been received and approvals are being issued as applications are assessed and authorised.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into the control and management of Ash Dieback disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance.</p>  <p>  I would like to re-iterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to give effect to these changes.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishermen to the High Court challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held, in summary, that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p><p>The High Court&rsquo;s ruling has been appealed by the State to the Court of Appeal and a stay was sought on the orders granted therein. A stay on the orders was refused by the High Court on 10th December.  At the Court of Appeal hearing regarding directions on 11<sup>th</sup>December, a hearing date of the 22nd and 23rd June 2021 was assigned to the case.  Counsel sought a priority date and was advised that the June date was effectively a priority date given the current backlog before the Court.  However, the case is on a waiting list and the State will be advised if an earlier date becomes available. Counsel have been instructed to draft the necessary legal papers to seek a stay on the High Court orders before the Court of Appeal.</p><p>As this matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I am not in a position to comment until the matter can be resolved before the Courts.</p><p>I should also advise the Deputy that the monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.  As Minister I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement. I have accordingly referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to SFPA for attention and direct reply.</p><p>The monitoring and control by the control authorities of fishing vessels within Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone will be managed from within existing funding allocations as published in the Revised Estimates for 2021.</p></reply>

It aligns with the overarching policy objective to develop a more integrated strategy for the livestock sector with closer alignment of the dairy and beef sectors. This includes development of enhanced strategies for dairy and dairy beef rearing as complementary to suckler enterprises.</p>  <p>  With the development of the ICBF&rsquo;s Dairy Beef Index, genetic trends for beef traits have improved greatly for beef sires, reassuring farmers that these beef-dairy calves have better beef potential.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Dairy Beef Programme with ICOS marts also continues to deliver valuable insights on how to build a more sustainable and integrated beef-from-dairy model. Genotyping and genetics are key aspects of this programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Calf Investment Scheme, which has now been integrated into TAMS, provides grant aid to farmers to help them buy new equipment for the rearing of dairy bred calves.</p>  <p>  I am very cognisant of the importance of all calves born on dairy farms, and most especially, in ensuring that the highest animal welfare standards continue to be practised on Irish livestock farms.</p></reply>

A working draft of this report is expected to be made available to the Taskforce for comment soon.</p><p>The purpose of the third report is to detail price points along the supply chain. Transfer pricing as an internal accounting practice is not relevant to this exercise, and thus not required under the terms of reference for the study. It is noted that all members of the Beef TaskForce had the opportunity to comment on, and agree, the Terms of Reference. </p><p>In relation to the cost of the Transparency Studies, the standard procurement process was used to select a suitable consultancy firm to carry out the three studies.</p><p>The full cost of the three reports is &euro;96,700.</p><p>In relation to the consultation process carried out as part of the studies, all relevant supply chain actors including food service were consulted as part of the engagement.</p></reply>

In that same period, the value of Irish meat exports to third country markets grew by nearly 50% to a value of &euro;575 million.</p><p>The growth of exports to third countries is aligned with my Department&rsquo;s market diversification efforts which have been considerably increased since the Brexit vote in 2016. Agreement has been secured for the export of beef to several new third country markets, including: China, Ukraine, Qatar, and Kuwait. Furthermore, during this period, enhanced market access for Irish beef has been agreed with countries including the US, Japan, Canada, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.</p><p>Ministerial-led trade missions are an important feature of the development and diversification strategy for the agri-food sector. As announced recently, our trade mission agenda for 2021 is planned to include the following priority markets:</p><p>- In Asia - China, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam</p><p>- In North America &ndash; the United States of America and Mexico</p><p>- key European destinations such as Italy and the UK</p><p>- and an exploration of markets in West Africa.</p><p>The format of each mission will be adapted to suit the prevailing Covid conditions but I am hopeful that it will include in-person trade missions.</p><p>Our enhanced focus on developing new market opportunities is a key part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the twin challenges of the economic impact of Covid-19 and Brexit. It is, of course, the role of industry to build on those opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Irish beef exports on a range of markets.</p></reply>

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone.</p>  <p>  Last week, I published a Preliminary Analysis of Transfers of Quota Shares on the gov.ie website which details quota transfers for Ireland across the different stocks. This compares the quota shares allocated to Ireland in 2020 and the corresponding new quota shares for 2021-2016. The Deputy will see from this document that reductions in the Annexes to the Agreement are graduated over the 5.5 year period of reciprocal access, but the largest part of the reduction, 60%, is between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for changes to fishing policy as a result of Brexit is multi-faceted. In respect of quota transfers from Ireland/EU, these will be phased in between the 1st of March 2021 and July 2026. However, some other changes for Irish fishing vessels have come into effect from 1st January 2021, such as changes in requirements to access UK fishing waters and requirements for vessels to make certain regulatory submissions when landing into UK ports.</p>  <p>  Other changes such as health requirements for exporting fish consignments from Ireland to the UK will come into effect from 1st April 2021, and the requirement for entry of such fish consignment exports into the UK through a Border Control Post will come into effect from 1st July 2021. Details of any changes of an operational and technical nature have been posted on the SFPA website.</p></reply>

We have been particularly active on the European dimension of this response. For example, additional funding provided to Bord Bia has been used to further its  Market Intensification Programme, and to support promotional campaigns for Irish beef in Germany and the Netherlands. Bord Bia has also been providing information to companies on how to establish a presence in other EU countries, and using its network of offices to build long-term relationships in those markets, including through participation in trade fairs. </p>  <p>  Trade missions have always played a key role in customer relationship building. Of course, the traditional "in person" visits are not currently feasible, so my Department, in collaboration with Bord Bia, led a series of virtual Trade Missions and business meetings during the 4th quarter of 2020. As part of this exercise, Minister Heydon and I addressed a number of events organised by Bord Bia, including a webinar with key German customers that involved its top six retailers, and a virtual trade reception hosted by the Irish Embassy in Paris. </p>  <p>  This highly innovative approach has been met with positive feedback from all participants, with more such events planned for 2021. We will continue to avail of every resource in furthering market access and trade advancement in Europe and further abroad. Indeed, the Government's focus on, and commitment to, this objective has also been illustrated by its appointment of my colleague, Martin Heydon T.D., as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this area. In addition, my Department's International Trade activities are being re-organised and further developed, as we deal with the twin challenges of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. </p></reply>

Work commenced on the &euro;25m project in October 2018 and to date there has been significant progress in the delivery of the project, with a substantial element of the works now completed.</p><p>The contractor applied to the High Court to enter voluntary examinership and this was granted on 12<sup>th</sup>October 2020. In accordance with the Public Works Contract, my Department terminated it&rsquo;s contract with L&amp;amp;M Keating Ltd. on 22<sup>nd</sup>October 2020.</p><p>My Department has been working closely with our Consulting Engineers since the termination of the contract  to plan the completion of the works. The site has been secured and made safe, emergency works have been completed on the breakwaters and a tender for completion of the Northern Quay has been advertised. It is expected that works will be completed in early 2022, however this timeline is, of course, subject to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.</p></reply>

Livestock on the organic farm facilitates effective organic manure and nutrient recycling, thereby improving soil fertility and productivity.</p>  <p>  The Organic Farming Scheme payment is computed on the basis of a minimum stocking rate of 0.5 Livestock Units per Hectare, which equates to 32.5 kg Organic Nitrate per hectare/per annum.

Notably strong growth was evident in pigmeat, poultry and dairy exports, with values increasing to the Netherlands, Italy and Spain in particular. </p>  <p>  Over the last number of budgets additional funding has been provided to Bord Bia to support our market diversification efforts.  These resources have been used to further Bord Bia&rsquo;s Market Intensification Programme and to support promotional campaigns such as for Irish beef in Germany and the Netherlands. Bord Bia has also been providing information to companies on how to establish a presence in other EU countries, and using its network of offices to build long-term relationships in those markets, including through participation in trade fairs. This work is supported by my Department's network of agriculture attach&eacute;s in the EU. </p>  <p>  Trade missions play a key role in customer relationship building, but of course the traditional "in person" visits are not currently feasible. Therefore, my Department, in collaboration with Bord Bia, led a series of Virtual Trade missions and business meetings during the fourth quarter of 2020. These had a strong European dimension, including a webinar with key German customers which included their top six retailers, and a virtual trade reception hosted by the Irish Embassy in Paris to engage with key customers in France.</p>  <p>  These highly innovative events have been met with positive feedback from all participants, and more such events are planned for 2021. We will continue to avail of every resource in furthering market access and trade advancement in Europe and further abroad, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

This Article sets out: <i>provided that TACs have been agreed, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year. Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.  </i>In relation to the main access arrangements, the Agreement also provides that the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:</p><p>(a) access to fish stocks listed in the Annex to the Agreement - these are the stocks that are shared between the EU and UK at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the parties respective shares of the TACs;</p><p>(b) access to fish non-quota stocks in each others EEZ's at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and</p><p>(c) access to waters of the Parties between 6 and 12nm in ICES divisions 4c (southern North Sea and 7d-g (English Channel, south - west coast of England and part of south - east coast of Ireland) to the extent that Union fishing vessels and UK fishing vessels had access to these waters on 31 December 2020.</p><p>I have asked my Department to work to ensure that fishing vessels which traditionally fished in UK waters will be granted such access by the UK authorities. </p><p>While authorisation for access for all licensed and registered fishing vessels has been sought from the UK authorities, at this time, approval has been granted to tranches of fishing vessels which have been identified as requiring such access.</p><p>The UK Authorities authorised access on a staged basis initially on 31 December for 141 vessels which were identified, in consultation with the Producer Organisations, taking into account vessels that were most likely to fish in the first week of January.  The vessels were identified in the days before the end of the year taking into account the Department's understanding of the fisheries and in consultation with the four Producer Organisations (Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation,  Irish Fish Producers Organisation, Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation).  </p><p>Vessels targeting mackerel in the RSW Pelagic segment and in the Polyvalent segment were specifically identified because mackerel is fished only in UK waters at the start of the year.  In addition, for the first tranche of 141 vessels, I understand that the POs identified vessels in their organisations which they were aware of as likely to fish in the start of the year in UK waters.  </p><p>Since the 31st December 2020, further lists of Irish vessels have been sent to the Commission to request authorisation by the UK authorities for these vessels to fish in the 12- 200 nm UK EEZ based on licence holders who contacted the Department seeking such access and those that had fished in UK waters in 2019 or 2020 based on relevant records. </p><p>As of Monday 18th January, a total of  214 vessels have now received an authorisation from the Department for access to the 12-200 NM UK EEZ.  Another list of six vessels, requesting authorisation to fish in the 12- 200 nm UK EEZ,  was sent to the Commission on the evening of Friday 15th January. The Department awaits to hear from the Commission regarding the status of the request for these six vessels.</p><p>The Department is also considering how smaller fishing vessels that do not have a Vessel Monitoring System to record activity maybe appropriately identified and will be consulting the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in that regard.</p></reply>

The objective of the proposed BAR is to provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in Member States, regions and sectors, in particular those that are worst affected by that withdrawal, and to mitigate the related impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion. The draft Regulation is subject to negotiations in the Council and European Parliament and its provisions may change. </p>  <p>  It is proposed that the BAR would have a budget of &euro;5.37 billion in current prices and that approximately &euro;1 billion would be allocated to Ireland in 2021 as pre-financing to assist Ireland in funding appropriate measures in 2021 and 2022 to assist the worst affected sectors of our economy.  The Government is very aware that our food sector, not least our fisheries sector, is particularly impacted by the outcome of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and is examining how best to deploy Ireland&rsquo;s proposed allocation under the Reserve to help our economy adjust to the new arrangements.  In relation to our seafood sector, I am exploring a variety of possible measures.</p>  <p>  In relation to the impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on our seafood sector, Government has continued to make available the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to sectors impacted by the Pandemic, including our seafood sector.  No additional funding has been made available by the European Union to fund any specific measures for our seafood sector.  Rather, any Covid-specific supports I can provide for the sector must be funded through my Department&rsquo;s existing European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme, which is nearing its end and has almost exhausted its budget.  </p>  <p>  The EMFF Programme provides a wide range of supports for fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing and for coastal communities.  It provides grants for capital investment, innovation, marketing, professional advice, training and applied research and throughout the Pandemic demand for these supports has been very strong, as seafood enterprises continue to invest to grow their businesses.  In 2020, I introduced special Covid support schemes for both the aquaculture and fisheries sectors through the EMFF Programme.  The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-Up Scheme assisted fishing vessels impacted by market disruption across Europe during the first wave, while the Covid-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme compensated aquaculture enterprises for the reduced sales and production caused by the Pandemic.</p></reply>

My Department, as Competent Authority in Ireland for recognition of EU Producer Organisations in the seafood sector, facilitates the establishment of Producer Organisations, but it is a matter for individual groups of producers in the fisheries or aquaculture sectors to organise and apply for that recognition. </p><p>In April 2020, I published revised Irish Recognition Criteria under the EU CMO Regulation to be satisfied by any Irish group of producers seeking recognition as a seafood Producer Organisation. One of the main drivers for this revision was to better facilitate groups of inshore fishers and groups of aquaculture enterprises in achieving recognition as a Producer Organisation.  </p><p>Producer Organisation status has many advantages, including better negotiating strength in the market for producers, financial supports under my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and certain protections under EU competition law.</p><p>In 2020, my Department received two applications from groups of inshore fishers seeking recognition as Producer Organisations. My Department is awaiting further information from the applicants to allow me to make a final determination on the applications within the three month time period specified in the CMO Regulation.  </p><p>To further assist groups of producers in attaining Producer Organisation status, in 2020, I introduced new financial supports under my Department&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, making available to groups of producers seeking recognition grants for IT equipment, office furniture, legal, accountancy and other relevant professional advice, website development costs and costs of room hire etc.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of the Covid-19 market disturbance.  </p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019. This reduction could only be recorded against individual herds that signed up for the programme.</p>  <p>  Obligations under the measure were developed based on analysis of the herd profile and nitrates profile of the national herd.  It was designed, in consultation with farmer representative organisations, to make the measure as easy to participate in as possible, whilst maintaining the requirement under the implementing regulation for temporary market adjustments.  </p>  <p>  Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some &euro;77.72M as part of the scheme. </p></reply>

Officials of my Department and I are very conscious of the challenges and concerns for all stakeholders posed by the COVID-19 situation.  At all times, our priority is to safeguard the health and safety of farm families, our staff and the wider community, while still facilitating scheme payments. Where possible, inspections are being done remotely, thereby avoiding the need for on-farm visits but, in certain situations, a farm visit is required in order to complete the pre-payment checks and controls to allow vital payments to be made to farmers. </p>  <p>  Inspections are carried out with HSE guidelines and Government requirements concerning COVID to the fore.  All inspections are notified in advance and the farmer is afforded an opportunity to defer the inspection for up to three weeks should there be COVID-related concerns or issues. In addition, inspectors are required to adhere to an inspection protocol which gives clear guidance to inspectors on procedures to be followed during the inspection.  We cannot defer inspections indefinitely as this would impact payments to scheme participants. </p></reply>

The scheme also continued to support public-realm type activities and the enhancement of town centre amenities, particularly where this aids the economic and/or social recovery of a town or village.</p>  <p>  Under the 2020 scheme, each Local Authority was invited to submit up to 10 projects to the Department for consideration. Selection of projects for submission to the Department was a matter for each Local Authority to determine.  </p>  <p>  Almost 250 applications were received under the Standard Measure of the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the level of funding sought far exceeded the available budget.  Funding under the Scheme was awarded on a competitive basis, with all applications being assessed for suitability for funding. Unfortunately, it was not possible to fund all of the proposals received and the application referred to by the Deputy was not amongst the 147 successful projects approved for funding of &euro;15.4 million that I announced recently.</p>  <p>  The application referred to by the Deputy included provision for car parking for a local sports ground. Car park improvements are an eligible activity for funding under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme where the improvements are expressly designed to encourage increased footfall in town centres. This was not adequately demonstrated in the case of the application referred to by the Deputy and, in addition, the Scheme gives less priority generally to works around sports grounds. </p>  <p>  My officials are available to discuss the project application further with the relevant Local Authority as required. </p></reply>

The objective was that these play areas would be available to all local families and visitors. In the case of schools, it was accepted that the use of play areas by the general public would need to be restricted to times outside of school hours.</p>  <p>  Schools funded under the 2018 and 2019 CL&Aacute;R programmes were willing to allow their play areas to be available for wider community use, and my Department entered into Funding Agreements with the relevant Local Authorities on that basis.  I have no plans to alter the terms of the Funding Agreements at this stage.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the CL&Aacute;R programme was adjusted to help rural communities respond to COVID-19.  Given the changed focus of the scheme last year, the Play Area and MUGA Support Measure was replaced with funding for Community Recreation Areas. The requirements under this Measure differ to those under the Play Area Measure, and so the concerns raised by the Deputy should not arise.</p>  <p>  Details of the Measures to be included for support under the CL&Aacute;R programme this year will be announced when I launch the 2021 CL&Aacute;R Programme.</p></reply>
