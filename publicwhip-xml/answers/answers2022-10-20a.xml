    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000055#WRA00600"><p>The continued increase in incidents of fraud is concerning. As highlighted in the most recent CSO crime statistics, most of the fraudulent activity recorded relates to attempts to obtain people&rsquo;s personal or banking information. </p><p>Every person in Ireland deserves to feel safe and to be safe when they conduct their personal business online or over the phone, and so the practice of trying to trick people out of their personal information or hard-earned money is truly disgusting and will not be tolerated.</p><p>I urge anyone conducting sensitive or personal business online or over the phone to be very cautious when providing personal or banking information. Many of the financial institutions have excellent advice for customers on how to be safe online, as does the Citizens&rsquo; Information website.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that October is European Cyber Security Month so I very much welcome the opportunity to further highlight this issue. This initiative aims to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats and to promote cybersecurity awareness and prevention, as this is by far the most effective way to combat this crime which often preys on the vulnerable. </p><p>Combatting and preventing fraud and related cybercrime falls under the remit of several Departments and agencies. I can assure the Deputy that there is close cooperation across the whole of Government on this issue and earlier this month I launched the awareness campaign in conjunction with my colleague Ossian Smyth, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>This year&rsquo;s campaign focuses on the twin themes of phishing and ransomware, urging vigilance and outlining their potential impacts on the everyday lives of Irish citizens and businesses. The campaign is being jointly promoted by the NCSC and the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB).</p><p>Over the course of Cyber Security Month, which runs throughout October, the NCSC has been raising awareness on phishing and ransomware across online and traditional channels. This is taking place alongside work by the GNCCB; both bodies are engaging with target audiences &mdash; for example the elderly and SME businesses &mdash; to highlight the risks involved and the steps that can be taken against both phishing and ransomware attacks.  </p><p>Phishing emails, used by attackers to lure people into disclosing personal details or clicking on malicious links, are used by cyber-criminals to gain unauthorised access to a computer or network. Hackers continue to design smarter and more sophisticated phishing emails, in the hope of gaining people&rsquo;s trust and pressuring them into acting without thinking. </p><p>Throughout October a key focus will be on informing the public, in particular the elderly, on how to avoid becoming a victim of email phishing, how to spot the tell-tale signs of these types of emails and what to do if a person has fallen victim to an e-mail phishing attack. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that these crimes are not taken lightly by this Government, or by Garda&iacute;, and I reiterate our commitment to tackling this form of crime, which particularly targets the vulnerable.</p><p>If anyone suspects that they have been the victim of a cyber crime or fraud, I would encourage them to contact Garda&iacute; to report this at the earliest possible time. I assure people that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be best placed to advise them.</p></reply>

The 2023 allocation will allow for continued good work in this field, backed by evidence based policy and practice. It will also ensure the delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy. </p>  <p>  A top priority is the expansion and deepening of the services offered to young people by the Youth Diversion Projects, which are fully funded by my Department. These projects provide an invaluable support to complement the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing youth crime and protect local communities.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that there are currently 13 Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) operating in Co. Cork, and they have received a total funding allocation of over &euro;2 million for this year. All of Cork North Garda Division is covered by three projects based in Cobh, Mallow and Youghal.  A mobile service with dedicated staff covers the remainder of the Division.</p>  <p>  Cork City Division has 8 projects, which take referrals from the entire Cork City Division. In the Cork West Division, a project covers both Bandon and Kinsale towns and their immediate hinterland.</p>  <p>  A public call for proposals to expand YDP coverage in Cork and a number of other areas in the State will issue from my Department in the coming months.  Youth services and other community organisations will be able to participate in this process.  Successful applicants will need to be registered charities, among other governance requirements. </p>  <p>  This level of funding will enable us to achieve national coverage for youth diversion projects, so that they are available in every part of the country, to every young person who might benefit from their services. </p>  <p>  It will also allow for more targeted work, where it is needed, for children who have proven hardest to reach to date. Funding of community-based organisations, to give special support to parents and families, including children under the age of twelve is a critical element of the necessary support.</p></reply>

The scheme provides legal aid and advice to people of limited means in civil disputes including in family law.</p>  <p>  The Review Group is being chaired by a former Chief Justice, with expert membership drawn from those who work with marginalised groups, legal practitioners, academics, Department officials and representatives from the Legal Aid Board, which administers the statutory scheme.</p>  <p>  I understand the Review Group held its first meeting on 22 June 2022, and its work is now ongoing.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, since its establishment, the Civil Legal Aid Scheme has been a hugely significant and beneficial resource for many people. However, within those 40 years, Irish society has changed, and the demands of the Scheme have grown. In order to provide maximum benefit to those it was established to serve, within the finite resources available to fund legal aid, a robust, comprehensive review of the Scheme is now timely.</p>  <p>  This review will allow for an assessment of how flexible and responsive the scheme is to the needs of those it is intended to serve. The Review Group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility. This work is expected to take 12 months. The Review Group will report periodically to me on progress before submitting its final report once its work is completed.</p>  <p>  As part of the review process, it is intended that there will be significant consultation, including a public consultation, to ensure that the insights of a range of stakeholders regarding the operation of the Scheme &ndash; and how best to support those of limited means with legal needs &ndash; will inform the work of the Review Group. Capturing the views of those with unmet legal needs will be an important part of the Group&rsquo;s consultation and engagement. I would encourage as many people as possible to participate and have their say on this important matter once the consultation opens.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the review should map out a future for the Civil Legal Aid Scheme, one which will provide for a flexible service that has, as far as possible, the capacity and resources to respond to the priority legal assistance needs of those of insufficient means.</p></reply>

There are of course a number of other options already in place through existing immigration programmes that have also been availed of by members of the Afghan community in Ireland since the beginning of August 2021 to 19 October 2022, a total of 140 join family visas have been approved for Afghan nationals and 94 family reunification applications have been approved and we continue to also process these applications sympathetically.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has received 528 applications to the Afghan Admission Programme and while no application has yet been approved under this Programme, a significant number of Afghan people have also been allocated places under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which is under the remit of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. My Department provides the visas to facilitate their travel to Ireland and almost 600 visa waiver letters have been issued to date.</p>  <p>  I understand that this is a difficult situation for our Afghan community and their loved ones. I would also like to assure the Afghan community that applications under this Programme continue to be assessed in a pragmatic and humanitarian manner with a view to issuing decisions as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Considerable information was provided by my Department to assist proposers in Ireland filling out the application form for their family members.  This included a detailed guidance document published in conjunction with the application form on 16 December 2021 and a Frequently Asked Questions document, drafted in light of queries received and published on 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>  The guidance document also included a detailed checklist to assist proposers in ensuring that all of the requested information was provided.</p>  <p>  The original closing date for the Programme was extended in consultation with civil society groups to allow proposers time to gather the required information and my Department continues to engage with these groups. </p>  <p>  The information required to apply was to ensure that the Programme benefitted its intended beneficiaries, and that my Department was satisfied as to the identities of both the proposers and their family members coming to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Where applicants are missing important information, such as proof of identity and familial relationships, my Department is contacting applicants directly to try to gather the required documents. This will help to ensure as many people as possible can avail of this important programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000055#WRA01900"><p>I would like to say at the outset that this Government is aware of the damaging affect anti-social behaviour can have on a community and as such remains very committed to tackling it. Some of the incidents we have seen recently are totally unacceptable and I am committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the resources to ensure people and communities are safe and feel safe. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that there are a number of measures are currently in place to tackle anti-social behaviour both in cities and in rural areas. The Expert Anti-Social Behaviour Forum, which is chaired by Minister of State Brown, was set up to examine the broad range of issues which lead to anti-social behaviour, and to develop measures to counteract its negative impact on life in a community.</p>  <p>  Within this forum, two subgroups were set up to counteract knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes. Arising from the work of the subgroup on the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes, funding of almost &euro;200,000 is being provided to eight community-based projects to work with young people involved in the anti-social use of scramblers and quad bikes and related crime. </p>  <p>  The government is rolling out a number of policy and legislative initiates which will reduce the level of anti-social behaviour. These include:</p>  <p>  - Providing the Garda&iacute; with new powers to seize and stop the illegal use of scrambler bikes </p>  <p>  - Introducing legislation to provide for body worn cameras for Garda&iacute; and community CCTV schemes</p>  <p>  - Rolling out the Community Safety Innovation fund to drive the development of community safety projects at a local level  </p>  <p>  - Examining the use of anti-social behaviour orders to ensure they are as effective as possible.</p>  <p>  - Introducing legislation to criminalise the grooming of children</p>  <p>  There are also a number of Garda operations active in cities across the country. In Dublin, Operation Citizen was commenced to reassure the citizens, visitors and businesses of Dublin City Centre that is a safe place to visit, socialise in and do business in. Operation Citizen was commenced in October 2021 and delivers a high-visibility police presence to Dublin City, while also focusing on collaborative community and stakeholder engagement. </p>  <p>  Operation Citizen is supported by other Garda Operations such as Operation Saul and Operation Spire. Operation Saul focuses on tackling anti-social behaviour on public transport networks in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. Operation Spire was initiated to combat all anti-social behaviour, particularly the supply of drugs in the O'Connell Street area.</p>  <p>  Operation Tara is an enhanced nationwide anti-drugs strategy that is in effect in cities across the country. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels, international, national and local, involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. Under Operation Tara, Garda&iacute; seized Cocaine and Cannabis with a value of &euro;220,000 in Cork City in July 2022.  Other recent successes include the seizure of &euro;348,000 worth of drugs in Dublin and Louth. Five people were arrested on 17 October 2022 and have been charged to appear before the Courts.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that we need to further strengthen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensure they have the resources, tools and technology to keep us safe. In support of this my Department committed an unprecedented &euro;2.14 billion in Budget 2023 to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  As recognised by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, improving community safety requires a multi-sectoral approach, strong inter-agency collaboration and engagement from the community. </p>  <p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships will play a key part in this by creating a tailor-made community safety plan with input from the local community and public services. Innovative pilot schemes have been rolled out in Waterford, North Dublin Inner City and Longford as they engage with the community to prioritise issues raised by its members.</p></reply>

In addition to the extensive policing measures to build safer communities, there are several crime prevention initiatives including the Community Alert Service.</p>  <p>  The Department has for many years provided funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re in relation to the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of three regional Development Officers. </p>  <p>  These Officers provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes. Funding is also provided to offset the costs incurred by community groups including the cost of issuing the text messages under the Text Alert Rebate Scheme. </p>  <p>  Funding in the region of &euro;150,000 has been made available to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by the Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to know that the Garda National Community Engagement Bureau are currently exploring the potential of further rolling out the &lsquo;See Something Say Something&rsquo; text alert initiative as part of a working group with both internal and external stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I understand that this innovative approach to reporting issues directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been very successfully piloted in Swords and Tralee, and the project will be further rolled out in a number of additional areas. </p></reply>

The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the group, or associated with the group, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and people being brought before the Courts, both here and in other jurisdictions, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles organised criminal activity through a range of targeted measures designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. To the greatest extent possible, these measures include the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.</p>  <p>  The additional resources allocated to AGS in recent years have enabled the Garda Commissioner to assign extra resources to the specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Armed Support Unit, Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses multi-disciplinary approaches to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. Such approaches include the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to CAB under the proceeds of crime legislation.</p>  <p>  Other measures taken to tackle organised crime include the strengthening of legislation where required, the establishment of a second Special Criminal Court in 2016, and the establishment of Garda Armed Response Units in all Garda regions which are available to support all divisions countrywide.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized almost &euro;64 million worth of illicit drugs and around &euro;6 million in cash, a significant increase from 2019, when there were over &euro;21 million worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;2.5m in cash seized. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) conducted a search operation in Counties Donegal, Limerick and Cork on Friday 14 October 2022 targeting a Limerick based Organised Crime Group (OCG).  The operation was conducted by Bureau Officers, supported by the Southern Regional Armed Response Unit and Garda&iacute; from Donegal and Limerick. The search operation marks a significant development in the overall CAB proceeds of crime investigation which will target assets including properties linked to this OCG. In addition, the CAB were successful in a recent application to the Courts to have a property effectively owned by  a prominent OCG recognised as being the proceeds of crime.</p>  <p>  I am also progressing the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill shortly, which will increase the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.</p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2022 commits to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit. In 2022, we will also progress draft legislation to outlaw the grooming of children into a life of crime. In parallel, we will continue to roll out a community intervention programme &ldquo;Greentown&rdquo; which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang. </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a number of important measures to reform legal education, judicial appointments and training and to enhance accountability and public confidence.</p>  <p>  Though the judiciary is independent in carrying out training through the Judicial Council, I am aware that the Judicial Council has provided training for the High Court and Circuit Court judges in relation to the Act. The Decision Support Service (who will operate the provisions of the Act)  participated in two training sessions for judges, organised by the Judicial Council. The presentation focused on the new support framework under the Assisted Decision-making (Capacity) Act 2015.

The ongoing work of my Department in this area is highlighted in Justice Plan 2022. I was delighted, as one of the actions of this year's Justice Plan, to publish the Rural Safety Plan 2022-2024 at the Ploughing Championships in September.</p><p>I recognise that rural safety is not just about the number of Garda&iacute;. Community Safety is a whole of Government responsibility and it requires a multi-agency approach. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department funds a number of initiatives around the country to help build rural safety.</p><p>Of course the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and detecting crime. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>This year's winter phase of Operation Thor was launched by Garda&iacute; on 01 October. Operation Thor is designed to tackle burglaries and associated criminal activities, which often increase in the darker winter months, through targeted enforcement and crime prevention activity and information.</p><p>Since its inception in 2015, Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property related crime and figures show that there has been a 36% reduction in the rate of such offences when compared to the pre COVID-19 levels in 2019. The Operation's winter phase places particular emphasis on preventing any predicted surge in burglaries of residential properties during this period. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2023 of over &euro;2.14 billion. I am advised that so far, the Public Appointment Service have provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the first two batches of candidates from this year's recruitment campaign following the interview process, totalling approximately 270 candidates. </p><p>Coupled with the Commissioner's intention to launch another recruitment campaign in mid-2023 and the level of funding provided by Government, this will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a pipeline of recruits.</p><p>In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill will also provide for the establishment of innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees, and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. Three pilot partnerships are currently underway in Longford, Waterford and Dublin's North Inner City.</p></reply>

It also identified measures that could support community safety and chart a path to improved community wellbeing in and around Drogheda.  </p><p>In July of last year, Minister Humphreys obtained Government approval for an Implementation Plan for the report. The Government also committed to a special focus on Drogheda, including Departments and State agencies prioritising necessary funding applications for projects related to the Drogheda Implementation Plan.</p><p>The Implementation Plan identifies the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outlines the next steps for engagement and delivery. The Plan is a living document and will be reviewed by my Department each quarter, with progress reports produced twice yearly. The first progress report of the Drogheda Implementation Plan, combining updates from Q1 and Q2 2022, is currently under development and will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The most important aspect of the Plan is at local level where the Drogheda Implementation Board is the core driver and co-ordinator of the activities outlined in the plan, with my Department providing national oversight to ensure strategic direction, action planning and the delivery of the Drogheda Implementation Plan through the Drogheda Oversight Board, which has met twice to date. </p><p>The first meeting of the Drogheda Implementation Board took place on 13 October 2021 and a number of positive actions have arisen from the plan to date. For example:</p><p>- The Department of Education has provided additional supports to the three Northside schools identified in the report for a five year period.</p><p>- My own Department and the HSE have provided further funding to the Red Door Project to ensure the continued provision of their important services. In total across 2021 and 2022, this represents an investment of &euro;230,000 in staffing resources to provide additional services in the Drogheda area.</p><p>- Funding was provided to the Moneymore Consortium to support their planning work for the proposed development of a community hub facility and to the Moneymore Childcare Centre to ensure the continuation of the essential meal service they provide to children. </p><p>- My Department secured a further &euro;250,000 in Dormant Accounts Funding for continued implementation of targeted crime prevention and harm-reduction measures in Drogheda in 2022.</p><p>- My Department announced additional Youth Diversion Funding of almost &euro;75,000 for early intervention and family supports to the Boyne Project.</p><p>- Drogheda based projects the Red Door Project (&euro;98,014) and For&oacute;ige (&euro;150,000) also received funding under the Community Safety Innovation Fund announced this week.</p><p>- The Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris recently announced funding for a new craft skills training hub in Drogheda which will provide training to approximately 336 apprentices each year.</p><p>Further details on the progress to date will be available in the upcoming progress report. </p></reply>

The Afghan Admissions Programme is an additional avenue open to Afghan nationals to bring close family members to live here with them. There are a number of other options already in place through existing immigration programmes that have been availed of by members of the Afghan community in Ireland and we continue to also process these applications sympathetically.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has received 528 applications to the Afghan Admission Programme.  Considerable information was provided to assist proposers in Ireland filling out the application form for their family members.  This included a detailed guidance document published in conjunction with the application form on 16 December 2021 and a Frequently Asked Questions document, drafted in light of queries received and published on 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>  The guidance document also included a detailed checklist to assist proposers in ensuring that all of the requested information was provided. The original closing date for the Programme was delayed at the request of civil society groups to allow proposers time to gather the required information.</p>  <p>  The information was requested to ensure the Programme benefitted its intended beneficiaries, and that my Department was satisfied as to the identities of both the proposers and their family members coming to Ireland. My Department reviewed the information received with a humanitarian and pragmatic eye, but unfortunately in many cases the information provided was not sufficient to process the application to its conclusion. </p>  <p>  My Department is now in the process of writing out to proposers where the information provided was not sufficient, specifying the information required and asking them to return that information within 20 working days of receipt of the e-mail requesting the information.</p></reply>

Operation Citizen delivers a high visibility police presence to Dublin City Centre and aligns with the government's overall aim to ensure people are safe and feel safe. It also focuses on collaborative community and stakeholder engagement, as the positive use of the public area is not just a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  For the period 22 October 2021 to 12 October 2022, there were are a total of 3,383 crime incidents recorded under Operation Citizen on the Garda PULSE System. I understand that these incidents are either under active investigation or currently before the Courts. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the resources they need to perform their vital role in the community, though the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the allocation of these resources. In Budget 2023, my Department committed an unprecedented &euro;2.14 billion to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an increase of over &euro;78 million on 2022. </p>  <p>  As part of Operation Citizen, I am told there are over 20 dedicated Garda&iacute; on foot and mountain bike patrols, who are supported by 12 mobile patrols from Pearse Street, Store Street, Bridewell and Kevin Street Garda Stations. There are in excess of 100 Garda&iacute; deployed to patrol Dublin City Centre every weekend with in excess of 500 additional policing hours provided each week to the area.</p>  <p>  I have also been informed that eight Garda&iacute; assigned to this operation full time are specifically patrolling the boardwalk and quays areas between 4pm and 4am daily. These are supported by 30 additional Garda&iacute; on city centre beat patrols and five Regional Armed patrols on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings. The Garda National Public Order Unit, which consists of 25 personnel on mobile patrols, also provides support for frontline units where necessary. </p>  <p>  Operation Citizen is also supported by a number of different operations currently ongoing in the Dublin City Centre area. These include Operation Saul, which aims to provide a safe environment for commuters travelling in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, and Operation Spire, which tackles on-street drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in the O'Connell Street area. </p>  <p>  I am told that under Operation Saul, a total of 116 crime incidents were recorded on the Garda PULSE system between 31 January and 12 October 2022. </p>  <p>  Operation Spire is focused between the hours of 8am and 8pm daily and takes a robust targeted approach to all those involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour, particularly drug related activity. The operation also includes liaison activity between DMR North Central and DMR South Central with homeless hostels and drug treatment centres. This is an essential element to responding to drug-related activity, as Garda enforcement alone will only displace the activity to another nearby location. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that 13A Upper O&rsquo;Connell Street has been identified as a strategically important piece of infrastructure to enhance An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high visibility policing service in Dublin City Centre. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the premises will act as a &lsquo;hub&rsquo; where Garda&iacute; attached to certain operations such as Operation Citizen and Spire will be able to report for duty at the hub rather than their home station.</p>  <p>  I am also informed that The Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS), which provides assistance to tourists who have been the victims of crime, will be co-located at the premises. </p></reply>

This plan identified three key goals to improve the health and welfare of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>The goals were to identify, communicate and enhance existing resources to promote health, wellbeing and work ability across the organisation, to develop partnerships with key stakeholders inside and outside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to to build capacity, and to provide support and advice.</p><p>A new wellbeing app called Keeping Our People Supported (KOP) was launched as part of the strategy. The app makes support available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 24/7 and can be accessed on any mobile device. It was created to ensure members who may be distressed and in need or urgent assistance can access the supports available to them at any time. </p><p>Policing as a profession exposes people to sometimes traumatic and challenging incidents &ndash; it is important that personnel have access to and avail of these supports when they need them. </p><p>In an attempt to negate the harmful effects of traumatic incidents, the Employee Assistance Service (EAS) are available to provide a confidential, professional, support and assistance service to members who may have been involved in a traumatic incident in work. I understand the service is available to help resolve work or personal issues that are causing stress, worry or disruption to an individual&rsquo;s life.  </p><p>I am further informed that in conjunction with the EAS, a Peer Supporter Programme was established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Peer Supporters are colleagues who have received appropriate training to help members cope with the effect of a traumatic incident in the workplace. Very often in circumstances of traumatic incidents, the response from a peer supporter has a huge impact in assisting colleagues in the aftermath of such occurrences. </p><p>I am advised that following each traumatic incident, a peer supporter is activated.  They will contact the member and offer support. In the event that the peer supporter deems it appropriate, they may refer the member to the Employee Assistance Service. </p><p>I am also advised that since June 2016, a 24/7, 365 Independent Helpline and Counselling Service is available to all staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the service available for both work and personal difficulties. The service is not mandatory and is self-referral. Each member of the Organisation may avail of six free sessions of counselling per year, an additional two will be provided if clinically approved.  All appointments and consultants are arranged directly between the Service Provider and the staff member.</p><p>Trauma-based counselling is also now available to all personnel following on from a traumatic incident in work. This counselling is a self-referral and is accessed through the same helpline, but the individual indicates to the call taker that the request is as a result of a traumatic incident. Trauma counselling provides 6 free sessions to the individual with the option of an additional 6 sessions if clinically approved.  If further sessions are required a request will be made to the Occupational Health Department.</p><p>Additional arrangements are also in place in respect of personnel attached to the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB), Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) and Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU), who are involved in the investigation of crimes involving the exploitation of children and sexual offences. As the Deputy can appreciate, investigations of these kind may include interaction with abusive or offensive material which is both violent and exploitative in nature. </p><p>Since February 2021, personnel in the areas mentioned above attend two mandatary one-to-one psychological sessions to step back from work and explore ways they can protect their wellbeing through improved resiliency/coping strategies, better self-care, having a healthy lifestyle and a better work-life balance. The sessions also provide a space for members to reflect upon and speak about how working with the trauma of others may impact upon their own mental health. These sessions must be attended and there is access to additional counselling sessions for staff attached to these units if required.</p><p>Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Occupational Health service and the Chief Medical Officer also provide intervention and support to personnel who are referred via local management following injuries on duty, sickness absence or traumatic events. </p></reply>

This important Bill makes provision for Garda powers to use modern digital technology, including providing for the expanded use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). </p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Bill deals specifically with ANPR, expanding its use beyond road traffic offences.  Going forward, ANPR will be used for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences,  the protection of the security of the State and the safeguarding against, and the prevention of, threats to public security, including securing public safety and public order. </p>  <p>  Its use must be necessary and proportionate. The Bill provides for the automatic transfer of ANPR records from designated third parties on an ongoing basis and provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the power to process those records.  Initially, this will be the Dublin Port Company, the National Roads Authority and Dublin Airport Authority PLC, all bodies with extensive ANPR camera networks already in place.  </p>  <p>  The Bill allows for other bodies to be designated for this purpose and also allows for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish its own cameras in strategic locations if it chooses to do so. It is also expected that ANPR cameras will be attached to many more Garda cars going forward. </p>  <p>  In relation to serious offences or national security matters, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be able to apply to monitor the movements of a particular vehicle, if they believe that the vehicle in question is connected to an investigation into an arrestable offence or a national security matter.  </p>  <p>  If a car, subject to focussed monitoring passes an ANPR camera, an alert will be created in a Garda monitoring room.  If the period of monitoring is three months or less, a Superintendent not connected to the investigation may approve it, if he or she believes it is necessary and proportionate.  Alternatively a Judge may provide the authorisation. The operation of ANPR generally will be subject to oversight by a High Court Judge who will report annually to the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  A Code of Practice relating to the operation of ANPR will also be prepared by the Garda Commissioner. In accordance with Part 8 of the Bill, the Code of Practice will set out the procedures to be used and the requirements relating to confidentiality, security, storage, access, retention, erasure and destruction of data.  Part 8 also establishes the requirements for consultation on the Code of Practice which, when finalised, will be submitted to the Minister for Justice and published in a Statutory Instrument. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that extensive legal advices have been provided on this Bill and appropriate safeguards are built into the legislation. There will be full compliance with GDPR and the Data Protection Act of 2018. The Data Protection Commissioner was consulted during the preparation of the Bill. </p></reply>

The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate. This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation of over &euro;2.14 billion in Budget 2023. </p><p>The Commissioner is responsible, as the Deputy will be aware, for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes the establishment of any operational policing units within the Garda&iacute;. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.</p><p>I am advised that the Commissioner has no current plans to introduce a dedicated transport police unit, as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's mission of 'Keeping People Safe' extends to all areas of our communities, including public transport. </p><p>There are a number of tools at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner, who is operationally responsible, to respond to anti-social behaviour on public transport. </p><p>Garda management engages extensively with transport operators, including the National Transport Authority, Irish Rail (DART and InterCity rail) and Transdev Ireland (Luas) to provide a high visibility presence through a coordinated approach. </p><p>I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p><p>I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that legislation covering anti-social behaviour is sufficient for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police these incidents. There are a number of existing pieces of legislation that are available to Garda&iacute; to tackle anti-social behaviour, including the Public Order Acts. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also currently operating a Reduction in Assaults Strategy, which includes advertising on social media regarding the consequences of perpetrating an assault on another person.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a range of regional and local operations in place to prevent, pre-empt and detect incidents arising.</p><p>For example, Operation Twin Tracks, a community engagement and rail safety policing initiative, is being conducted by Garda&iacute; in partnership with other public transportation stakeholders. This Operation was launched with the purpose of providing high visibility policing of rail and light rail transport within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and the rail networks and train stations nationwide, and to deliver crime prevention advice to rail and light rail users.</p><p>Two days of action were held on 3 June and 29 July where high visibility patrolling operated between the hours of 3pm and 11pm on each day within the Dublin Region (Connolly and Heuston Stations) and nationwide on eight intercity routes. Local Crime Prevention Officers and Community Policing Garda&iacute; were available to deliver crime prevention advice at community engagement/crime prevention stands at a number of stations on each of the days. </p><p>In January this year, the Garda authorities also launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen, the Garda operation to reassure people that Dublin City Centre is a safe place to visit.  Operation Saul aims to provide a safe environment for commuters using public transport services in the City.  </p><p>It is important to note that operators have noted a decrease in incidents since the beginning of Operation Saul.  For instance, the Luas has seen a fall of almost 40% in anti-social behaviour notwithstanding an overall increase in passenger numbers.</p></reply>

The allocation of funding was announced on 17 October and a full list of successful projects is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  The funding call for the Community Safety Innovation Fund invited applications from community safety initiatives as well as groups co-funded with local authorities, NGOs and community organisations working on issues relevant to community safety and youth justice.</p>  <p>  The Fund reinvests the proceeds of crime seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in local projects to build stronger, safer communities. Each successful project has detailed how best the community wants to prevent crime and their proposals reflect community priorities and local safety issues.</p>  <p>  Based on the high quality of proposals received, I believe the successful projects have the potential to have a real impact on their respective communities. I also want to encourage those who applied this year but did not receive funding to consider applying again next year. </p></reply>

This includes focusing on prevention and on providing victim-centred supports and services.</p><p>I recently published Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat DSGBV. The goal is clear: zero tolerance in Irish society for any form of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, following an independent audit of responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, it was agreed that responsibility for service provision, as well as for policy, should sit together under the remit of my Department. Government also agreed to establish a new statutory agency which will be operation in 2024 and which will ensure this priority area continues to receive the expertise and focus needed to drive it forward.</p><p>Under Budget 2023 I was able to secure an extra &euro;9 million for 2023, a 22% increase, for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence. This will also support the implementation of the Zero Tolerance plan.</p><p>This &euro;9 million includes increased funding of &euro;7 million for organisations funded by TUSLA to address acute service demands in existing services throughout the country, and for investment in new services as outlined in Zero Tolerance. This funding also strengthens the nationwide supports, and will help to maintain the momentum in implementing the ambitious goals set out in the national strategy.</p><p>In total, Tusla has been allocated &euro;37 million for funding DSGBV services which includes the additional &euro;7 million in funding I was able to secure. Separate to the funding of DSGBV services, my own Department has allocated &euro;6.09 million for measures to tackle DSGBV, including through awareness raising campaigns and funding for perpetrator programmes.</p><p>Mt Department has allocated a further &euro;5.8 million for providing funding to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, which of course includes victims of domestic and sexual crime.</p><p>As part of the MOU covering the transition of DSGBV Services to the new DSGBV agency, my Department, Tusla and Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be identifying key priorities for the additional &euro;7m allocated to Tusla to maintain the existing service level, to address acute demands and for new services. This will be based on engagement with the DSGBV sector and priorities set out in the third national strategy.</p><p>Tusla will be engaging with funded DSGBV organisations on service and funding agreements for 2023 over the coming weeks. Specific funding to individual organisations will be agreed as part of that process and further information on how money is allocated will be available after that process has finished. </p></reply>

So far this year, the Registration Office of my Department has issued and processed over 50,000 first time registration appointments. </p>  <p>  Additionally, if a non-EEA national is residing in the Dublin area and has an existing valid permission to be in the State, then they do not need to seek an appointment to attend in person to renew their permission. An online renewal facility was launched in July 2020 to processes renewals and there has been 173,000 approx. registrations renewed online since the facility was launched. There is currently a 3 week processing time for online renewal of permissions at present. All persons over the age of 16 are issued with an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) Card which displays details of the permission granted, the conditions attaching and the expiry date of the permission. </p>  <p>  I have also checked with EURAXESS Ireland who processes PhD researcher Hosting Agreements on behalf of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner is of course responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters, deployment of resources and the provision of IT infrastructure. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  </p><p>As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, you may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website. </p><p>Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. I understand that on 04 October 2022, Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman gave the Joint Committee on Justice an update on this Action, and indicated An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s commitment to the portal.</p><p>In relation to whether or not an online portal will be enabled through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Recording Devices) Bill 2022,  I can inform the Deputy that the legal advice made available to me indicates that specific legislative provisions will not be required for an online portal.  Section 41 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides a lawful basis for personal data collected for one purpose to be processed for another purpose, where such onward processing is for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences. </p><p>Therefore, members of the public who collect dashcam footage are entitled to pass it on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is entitled to process it for the law enforcement purposes mentioned. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would need to process such data in line with its data protection obligations generally and would be required to put guidelines in place for dealing with the data obtained, its retention and destruction.</p><p>I am assured that road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority. </p><p>It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations. </p><p>I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The Government endeavours to fill judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity, and a number of such vacancies have been filled recently.</p><p>In order to bring more strategic focus to this, I established a Judicial Planning Working Group in April 2021, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government and the Justice Plan action to &ldquo;Establish a working group to consider the number of and type of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years&rdquo;. Future judicial resourcing needs will be informed by the report and recommendations of this Group.</p><p>To help support the work of this Group, the OECD were commissioned to prepare an independent review of judicial resources, including benchmarks against international comparators. This is the first time such a review has been undertaken. Due to the complexity of evaluating the data and analysis underpinning the research, it has taken longer than originally anticipated for the OECD to complete its work. A draft final report from the OECD is currently under review by my officials. The Judicial Planning Working Group expects to submit its final report to me shortly, having considered the OECD research.</p><p>As an interim measure, the Government increased the number of judges in the High Court from 37 to 42 last year with the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.</p><p>In addition, section 8 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 provided for the number of High Court judges to be exceeded by a further one should the Government, at my request, having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, form the opinion that it was necessary due to the volume of business and to ensure the efficient administration of justice. I brought a Memorandum to Government on 19 January 2022, with a recommendation to have that additional High Court post filled.</p><p>With that appointment to the High Court, the complement of High Court judges is now six more than it was on 1 October 2021. This represents one of the largest increases in judges in recent memory and a very significant investment by the State in judicial resources.</p></reply>

This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy contains actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Of the recommendations in Ballymun - a Brighter Future which relate to areas under the remit of my Department, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation of &euro;2.14 billion provided in Budget 2023, an increase of &euro;78 million on last year. </p>  <p>  While the Commissioner is operationally responsible for the allocation of resources, I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure optimal use. </p>  <p>  In this regard I am pleased to inform the Deputy, that Garda numbers in the Ballymun Garda District have increased by 55 since to 31/12/2017 to an overall Garda strength of 266 on the 30/9/2022. In addition, the strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region North Drugs Unit, has also increased in the same period from 19 to a strength of 29. </p>  <p>  Garda Operation Tara has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of this Operation is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels. Recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of &euro;348,000 seized in Dublin and Louth, where five people were arrested on 17 October 2022 and have been charged to appear before the Courts.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, an additional allocation of &euro;6.7m was provided in Budget 2022 and another &euro;2.5m in 2023 to ensure the delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy , in particular the expansion and deepening of the services offered to young people by the Youth Diversion Projects which are fully funded by my Department. These projects provide an invaluable support to complement the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing youth crime and protect local communities, including those YDPs already operating in Ballymun. </p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that under the Community Safety Innovation Fund, &lsquo;Base Bus Ballymun&rsquo; &ndash; A Community Mobile Access Project, has received &euro;120,000 in funding. This project aims to redefine places of anti-social behaviour into more positive social environments by providing early intervention and preventative action.</p>  <p>  Further, as recognised by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, improving community safety requires a multi-sectoral approach, strong inter-agency collaboration and engagement from the community.</p>  <p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships will play a key part in this by creating a tailor-made community safety plan with input from the local community and public services. Innovative pilot schemes rolled out in Waterford, North Dublin Inner City and Longford engage with the community to prioritise issues raised by its members. These areas were chosen for a number of factors including population density, crime trends and deprivation. These pilot schemes are to run for 24 months with a view to then rolling them out nationwide.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Joint Agency Response to Crime (&lsquo;JARC&rsquo;) is an example of a strategic multi-agency initiative involving an intensive, highly collaborative approach to the supervision and rehabilitation of prolific offenders in particular areas of Dublin and beyond. </p>  <p>  The three lead agencies (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service) with the active support of my Department and in partnership with other State bodies and community-based organisations, work together in a close and highly structured manner to steer these recidivist offenders away from criminality.</p>  <p>  The STRIVE project is a specific JARC initiative established in 2015 and targets very high-risk offenders, who are identified as causing the most harm in the community, using a coordinated approach with local stakeholders. The programme currently has capacity for 24 clients at any one time, which is an increase of three clients as has been agreed by the JARC governance structures during Q3 2022. This small expansion is manageable given the current resource commitments for the initiative.</p>  <p>  The Operational team in STRIVE includes representatives from the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and Ballymun Job Centre.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitment to extend the pilot schemes of the Joint Agency Response to Crime to more areas to target prolific repeat and vulnerable offenders aged 16 -21, Justice Plan 2021 contains a commitment to identify areas in which to expand the JARC project.</p>  <p>  Key steps in this process include the recent establishment of a new oversight and governance structure for multi-agency offender management initiatives including SORAM, JARC, Domestic Violence &amp;amp; Complex High Risk Prisoners and Life Sentence Prisoners.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to note that while these new structures bed down, work is also ongoing on a formal independent evaluation of a number of the  JARC initiatives. The STRIVE programme is one of the programmes that is being evaluated.  </p>  <p>  Any decisions to expand JARC will be made in the context of the outcome of this evaluation process and will form part of the ongoing agenda for the new oversight mechanism.</p></reply>

Ireland is generally regarded as a safe country in international terms, with relatively low crime rates and a general feeling of safety and security. However, we recognise that this is not the case in every community and that people living in some areas can experience a different reality. </p><p>A community safety approach prioritises issues identified by the community itself as safety concerns and increases community confidence in service providers.</p><p>My Department's Community Safety Policy will ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole of Government responsibility and priority, to be delivered through Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), supported through a national governance structure. </p><p>The LCSPs will bring all services and the community together at local authority level, building upon and replacing existing Joint Policing Committees, to serve as a forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. </p><p>This means State services working with each other and the community to ensure there is better coordination between services such as educational and youth work with young people, the availability of local health and mental health services, drug prevention, housing and the built environment, and actions taken to combat alcohol and substance abuse, domestic abuse, youth crime, anti-social behaviour, and hate crime.</p><p>The partnership approach is built on two premises:</p><p>1. Every community is different and has different problems and issues; and</p><p>2. Responding to those problems and issues requires a range of inputs from across Government, local services, voluntary sector and the community itself.</p><p>Three pilot LCSPs have been fully established in Dublin North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots have been working to develop unique community safety plans, and the Longford Local Community Safety Pilot published its plan on 19 September. </p><p>The pilots will run for two years and each pilot is subject to an ongoing independent evaluation, lasting for the 24 month duration of the pilots. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, after the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted. </p><p>Over time, the evaluation will assess how well the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their respective communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs have had with the local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety.</p><p>Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model in every local authority area. The initial phase of fieldwork was focused on reviewing processes and establishing a baseline for any outcomes of the work of the Partnership pilots over the next two years.</p><p>Establishing a baseline is an important aspect of the evaluation as it ensures a solid understanding of the starting point against which to compare the data at the latter stages of the evaluation. </p><p>A baseline report has been completed and submitted to the Department and will be published on the Department&rsquo;s new community safety website this month.</p><p>The mid-term evaluation, which will report on findings from the pilots, is due in Q4 2022.</p></reply>

Laois. </p><p>People and communities in rural Ireland deserve to feel safe and to be safe. Community Safety is is a whole of Government responsibility and it requires a multi-agency approach if it is to be truly effective.</p><p>The Rural Safety Plan is the result of strong collaboration between all the relevant organisations and brings together the excellent work already underway in relation to rural safety. The Plan is not intended to replace, but rather supplement, this work.</p><p>The vision of the Rural Safety Plan is for people and communities in rural Ireland to feel safe and be safe in their homes, their places of work, and their local environments.</p><p>The Plan identifies 5 main priorities in relation to rural safety. They are:</p><p>1. Community Safety</p><p>2. Burglary and Theft</p><p>3. Roads Policing</p><p>4. Animal Crime</p><p>5. Heritage Crime.</p><p>The Plan outlines the key actions underway in these priority areas in an informative and accessible way and also provides useful contacts for partner organisations, groups committed to supporting victims of crime, and organisations that share the Department of Justice&rsquo;s aim of advancing the safety of our people.</p><p>Some of the objectives set out in the Plan, such as the launch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's new property recording app, have already been achieved. Others will be progressed through the lifetime of the Plan and beyond. </p><p>I want to recognise the wide-ranging and impactful work to further people&rsquo;s safety and welfare that is being undertaken in rural communities across the country. Much of this work is undertaken by dedicated volunteers who admirably commit so much of their time to the benefit of our communities and our country.</p><p>For the Deputy's information the Plan is available at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/3502e-rural-safety-plan-2022-2024/#:~:text=The%20vision%20of%20the%20Rural,in%20relation%20to%20rural%20safety</i>.</p></reply>

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to target those involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs including through Operation Tara which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland.</p>  <p>  The focus of this Operation is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local street level dealing and sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of &euro;465,000 worth of cannabis in Ballygar, Co. Galway on 7 September and the seizure of &euro;360,000 worth of cannabis in Pollerton, Co. Carlow on  2 October.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner tasked an Inspector in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug-related intimidation. There are currently thirty nominated Garda Inspectors appointed to act as liaison officers for the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, covering each Garda Division.</p>  <p>  Information in relation to the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide is available on the Garda Website. This programme has been developed to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug related intimidation. In dealing with any complaint of drug-related intimidation or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will do so with the utmost safety in order to afford the person or family subject to the threat of the best level of security, advice and support which can be offered.  </p>  <p>  An annual conference on the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, coordinated by the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau, took place in August 2022 and was attended by nominated Inspectors, local and Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Force representatives. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na presented on the subject of Drug Related Intimidation to the Annual Conference of the Joint Policing Committees organised by the Policing Authority in September 2022.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to tackling the supply of drugs at all levels and they continue to work with joint policing committees, both at regional and city level. Community policing forums are based locally in individual Garda districts and sub-districts and Joint Policing Committees address the issue of drugs and drug-related intimidation from the lower level to the most serious level. The North Inner City Dublin Local Community Safety Partnership pilot is also exploring utilising a drug related intimidation programme as part of its work.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health and the National Drugs Strategy, Frank Feighan T.D., launched the Drug Related Intimidation and Violence Engagement (DRIVE) Report in November 2021. DRIVE is a multi-agency response to Drug Related Intimidation, recognising the additional challenges arising from drug-related intimidation in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  Membership of the DRIVE Oversight Committee is comprised of representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Regional and Local Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Forces, HSE Social Inclusion, Probation Service, family support and the Community &amp;amp; the Voluntary sector.  </p></reply>

In a number of cases the Oireachtas has prescribed a presumptive minimum sentence for certain serious offences, however this is currently being reviewed under a requirement contained in the Judicial Council Act.</p><p>In imposing a sentence, a court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate, not only to the crime but also to the offender, based on the facts heard in each individual case.</p><p>As provided for in the Judicial Council Act 2019, a new Sentencing Guidelines Committee has been established by the Judicial Council which includes a number of lay members.  The Committee is responsible for compiling sentencing guidelines with a view to establishing parameters and norms to help guide a judge while sentencing.  The courts are also required to hear from victims in certain cases where they wish to make a victim impact statement. </p><p>I believe that our criminal law must ensure that a wider range of appropriate options are available to the judiciary including, where appropriate, custodial sentences that reflect the harm caused by crime to victims and to communities. </p><p>That is why I am proposing legislative changes that will increase the maximum sentence permitted for assault causing harm, taking it from 5 to 10 years. </p><p>I will also provide for an increase in the sentence for the offence of conspiracy to commit murder of up to life imprisonment. </p><p>I am introducing new standalone offences of stalking and non-fatal strangulation so that appropriate sentences can be imposed to reflect the harm caused by such insidious offences.</p><p>In the coming weeks, I will also publish new Hate Crime legislation which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against protected characteristics.</p><p>In addition, I am examining reforms to the current mandatory life sentence for murder which would allow a judge to specify a minimum number of years, or tariff, to be served for murder.  This change would allow the courts to reflect the aggravating factors and gravity of certain cases and give the public more confidence that, in the most heinous murder cases, judges will have the discretion to set a minimum tariff for a life sentence.  </p><p>The Deputy will however also appreciate that imprisonment is not always the most appropriate punishment for offending behaviour and the Programme for Government set out a coherent approach to enhancing and sustaining a more just and safe society with a specific commitment to review policy options for prison and penal reform, which my Department has been undertaking over the last two years. </p><p>The recently published reports of the Penal Policy Working Group and the Task Force on Mental Health and Addiction in the criminal justice system, chaired by former Minister Kathleen Lynch and undertaken jointly by experts in my Department and the Department of Health, both recognise that reducing re-offending requires a system not just focused on punishment but also on rehabilitation and reintegration.  This includes ensuring that a range of effective alternatives to short custodial sentences are available as well as providing offenders with the opportunity to examine and address the root causes of their own offending behaviour.  </p></reply>

Trespass may be dealt with under criminal law in certain circumstances and a range of offences are provided for in legislation.</p>  <p>  There is already robust legislation in place in relation to trespass and I have, therefore, no plans to change the law in this regard, but the situation will be kept under review. For the Deputy's information, outlined below are a variety of legal provisions in place with regard to trespass.</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended, contains provisions specifically relating to the unauthorised entry onto and occupation of land. Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences in relation to illegal trespass and occupation of land. Such land includes public land provided or maintained by a statutory body or held in trust primarily for the enjoyment of the public and land covered by water. The legislation empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land. A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month, or both.</p>  <p>  - Trespass in relation to buildings, as well as land, is also dealt with in the 1994 Act. Section 11 of the Act provides that it is an offence for a person to enter a building or the vicinity of a building as a trespasser with the intention of committing an offence or interfering with property. A person who is guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.</p>  <p>  - In addition, section 13(1) of the same Act provides that it is an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, to trespass on a building or in the vicinity of a building in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person. Section 13(2) empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request the person concerned to desist from acting in such a manner and to immediately leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. It is an offence not to comply with a direction given by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 13(2). A person who is guilty of an offence under section 13(1) is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both. A person who is guilty of an offence under section 13(2) is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.</p>  <p>  - The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 also contains provisions relating to trespass. Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forceful occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence. A person guilty of a first offence under the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both. A second or subsequent offence under the Act is punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for term of up to 12 months, or both. Conviction on indictment for an offence under the Act can result in a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a prison term of up to 3 years, or both. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I intend to amend a number of sections of the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995, in line with the Government policy objective of restricting the liability of occupiers. I believe these proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that businesses, community groups and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities, while also acknowledging the importance of personal responsibility of visitors, recreational users and trespassers.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments, which build on a Review Paper prepared by my Department in February 2021, and subsequently published, contain four key developments:</p>  <p>  - they will reflect in primary legislation a number of recent court decisions which rebalance the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors and recreational users;</p>  <p>  - they change the standard to clarify that when the occupier of a property has acted with reckless disregard for a recreational user or trespasser, the standard of reckless disregard rather than that of reasonable grounds should apply in relation to any consideration of liability;</p>  <p>  - they limit the circumstances in which a court can impose liability on the occupier of a premises where a person has entered onto premises for the purpose of committing an offence; and</p>  <p>  - they allow for a broader circumstances where it can be shown that a visitor or recreational user has voluntarily assumed a risk.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to tackling anti-social behaviour by ensuring more visible community policing, in line with the Report of the Future of Policing. This will significantly reduce antisocial behaviour and help make people feel safer in their communities.</p><p>We will always support communities, and honest, hard-working people who want and deserve to be safe on their streets. We will never allow anti-social behaviour from a small minority terrorise any community. Communities who need our help will get it.</p><p>The government is rolling out a number of policy and legislative initiates which will reduce the level of anti-social behaviour. These include:</p><p>- Providing the Garda&iacute; with new powers to seize and stop the illegal use of scrambler bikes</p><p>- Introducing legislation to provide for body worn cameras for Garda&iacute; and community CCTV schemes</p><p>- Rolling out the Community Safety Innovation fund to drive the development of community safety projects at a local level  </p><p>- Examining the use of anti-social behaviour orders to ensure they are as effective as possible.</p><p>- Introducing legislation to criminalise the grooming of children</p><p>In addition, and in line with a Programme for Government commitment, Minister Browne established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour in 2020 which is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and will, if appropriate, propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. </p><p>Along side the work of the Forum, an additional allocation of &euro;6.7m was provided in Budget 2022 and another &euro;2.5m in 2023 to ensure the delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy, in particular the expansion and deepening of the services offered to young people by the Youth Diversion Projects, which are fully funded by my Department.</p><p>My Department is continually seeking to strengthen our evidence based approach to combatting anti-social behaviour, as is the entire Government. Supporting communities to be safe and feel safe requires a whole of government approach and that is why the Local Community Safety Partnerships are currently being piloted across three locations, bringing local communities together with all of the key service providers in their area to identify the particular issues that need to be tackled in their local area and drawing up a plan to set out the steps that will be taken to address them, by whom and when. Listening, implementing, assessing and where necessary, adapting our policies is a key part of how the Department and the other Justice agencies are working to tackle anti-social behaviour.</p><p>I want to commend the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who every day face the challenges of dealing with crime in the post-pandemic landscape. Just last month, Minister Browne and I met with the Garda Commissioner to discuss a number of issues, including anti-social behaviour. The Commissioner fully agrees that high-visibility policing is a crucial element of ensuring that communities are safe and feel safe.</p><p>This will be prioritised by supporting and enhancing ongoing Garda operations, such as Operation Citizen, which provides a visible presence in the city centre, and Operation Tombola, which tackles anti-social behaviour over the Halloween period. </p><p>But I know the Deputy will agree that a multi-agency approach is critical to tackling anti-social behaviour, as has been seen following the events in Cherry Orchard last month. I am particularly pleased by the innovative projects that my Department is supporting through the Community Safety Innovation Fund announced last Monday. This and other innovative, cross-cutting projects form a key part of the Government's response to anti-social behaviour.</p><p>There are also numerous other Garda operations taking place across the country, and the Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs to combat anti-social behavior. An unprecedented allocation of over &euro;2.14 billion<b></b>has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Budget 2023.</p></reply>

A person convicted of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a maximum fine of &euro;2,500, or to both, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both. </p><p>I have also signalled my intention to increase the maximum penalty available for this offence to 10 year imprisonment, in amendments to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas. </p><p>Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides for the offence of dangerous driving.  A person who commits an offence under the section is liable to (a) in the case of death or serious bodily harm to another person, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine not exceeding &euro;20,000 or to both, and b) in any other case, a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.</p><p>In addition, section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for the offence of assault or threatening to assault certain categories of persons. Such persons include a person providing medical services in a hospital, or any person assisting such a person, a peace officer or any person assisting a peace officer, or any other person with intent to resist lawful apprehension or detention for an offence.  The term 'peace officer' includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel or a member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>A person convicted of an offence under section 19 of the 1994 Act is liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both. A person convicted of such an offence on indictment is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, or to both. The latter penalty was increased from a maximum term of 5 years in 2006. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, sentencing in individual cases is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence. The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the law in this area under review.</p></reply>

This includes the deployment of Garda members throughout the State. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with the unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2023 of &euro;2.14 billion.<b></b>This unprecedented amount will fund the planned recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda recruits as well as over 400 Garda staff.</p><p>I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimal use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs. I am further advised that there are no set requirements to have a specific number of Community Garda&iacute; posts across the Divisions.</p><p>The table below, provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Longford Garda stations by rank at 31 August, the latest date for which figures are available.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Station</th>       <th>Inspector</th>       <th>Sergeant</th>       <th>Garda</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballymahon</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Granard</td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Edgeworthstown</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that, to date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society, including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in the course of carrying out their duties.</p><p>Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda Operating Model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under 'A Policing Service for Our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations.</p></reply>

Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.</p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks. An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. These penalties demonstrate the seriousness attached to breaches of the legislation governing the importation and use of fireworks.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, each year in the run up to Halloween, additional efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks, under what is known as Operation Tombola. This year is no different and I have been advised  by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Tombola commenced on 01 October. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that, through Operation Tombola, each Regional Assistant Commissioner ensures that appropriate measures are put in place in each Division, to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na puts in place a range of measures to combat the importation, sale and distribution of illegal fireworks, through intelligence led operations, visits to local car boot sales, searches and seizures of fireworks. They also liaise with local authorities and Fire Services, and identify and remove stockpiles of bonfire material and abandoned vehicles from locations.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also promote awareness of the dangers associated with the improper use of fireworks and unsupervised bonfires through the media, social media, school visits and information leaflet distribution by the Crime Prevention Officer and members generally. They conduct high visibility policing of Halloween night celebrations, i.e. beat, bike and mobile patrols, thus preventing damage to property, injury, trauma for the vulnerable and the elderly, and general anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Commissioner that policing plans under the auspices of Operation Tombola include an overt uniform presence and covert element where appropriate. Local Garda management are engaged with relevant stakeholders, including the local authorities, to identify, co-ordinate and implement an appropriate multi-agency strategy for the busy Halloween period.</p>  <p>  Operation Tombola also focuses on preventing associated public disorder and anti-social behaviour through the incremental deployment of resources, including Garda Public Order Units where appropriate, to augment local plans. </p>  <p>  I am very aware of the distressing impact the improper use of fireworks has on our communities. I know the fear and distress fireworks being set off cause, in particular, our elderly family members and neighbours and people with sensory challenges and other vulnerabilities. They also have a terrible impact on pets and other animals and livestock.</p>  <p>  That is why every year as Halloween approaches, my Department runs a safety campaign aimed at ensuring the public is aware of the dangers of illegal fireworks and bonfires. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I launched this year's awareness raising campaign urging against the misuse of fireworks in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) and Dublin Fire Brigade .</p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s campaign emphasises the distressing impact the improper use of fireworks has on communities and both wild and domestic animals. Highlighting the damaging and life changing consequences these dangers can pose, not only to those who directly use illegal fireworks, but also innocent bystanders to whom the improper use of fireworks can cause serious distress and injury, the campaign urges people to consider those who are indirectly impacted by their actions over this Halloween period. The campaign also seeks to remind the public of the serious penalties that can be imposed for the misuse of illegal fireworks. </p>  <p>  To support the campaign and increase our reach my Department have also been in touch with local authorities and frontline services across the country, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, and SpunOut &ndash; a dedicated youth information provider, so that the campaigning messaging is shared with the widest possible audience.  </p>  <p>  The campaign messaging is also featured on local radio stations across the country, as well as across social media, YouTube and Spotify. As always, this messaging will continue to be pushed out across a number of mediums including social media on a regular basis until early November.</p></reply>

That said, the HSE has advised that it is the developer&rsquo;s intention that works will recommence on the project as soon as possible and that, to this end, the HSE remains in continuing dialogue with the landlord.  </p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to impress on the HSE the importance of working with the developer to progress construction as a matter of urgency and the HSE has formally requested a planned recommencement date and programme of works to completion.  </p>  <p>I understand that this delay is frustrating for the people of Ballyhaunis and its surrounding area. However, I wish to reiterate that both I and the HSE remain committed to the delivery of a Primary Care Centre in Ballyhaunis as quickly as possible.

This informed a process of pay restoration for 300 of the largest Section 39 organisations, including the 50 engaged in the pilot. Eligibility for pay restoration was based on certain criteria, including those who received over &euro;250k from the HSE through a Service Level Agreement.  A total of &euro;39.16m has been provided for Pay Restoration to date, with a final &euro;4.75m due to be paid in 2023.  </p>  <p>  As colleagues will be aware, Section 39 organisations are independently owned and run. As a result, data on the exact number of Section 39 staff employed and their salary level is unavailable. I cannot, therefore, provide the deputy with an estimated cost relating to pay increases within Section 39 organisations.  However, as there are 1,476 Section 39 organisations currently funded by the HSE, we know that this would be a substantial amount.</p>  <p>  I believe a process similar to that conducted for pay restoration could play a useful role in providing solutions to the current pay-related issues that Section 39 organisations have raised.  Such a process would help to establish the figures sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, services are in place to provide care for children who may need it. At present, evidence supports the provision of care to children by their GPs and if necessary, by general paediatricians, working in multi-disciplinary teams.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Paediatrics and the National Clinical Advisors and Group Leads for children and young people work closely with the HSE Long-Covid team to review evidence and support access to care.

However, the increase in activity in all three Injury Units is a positive development. In 2021, 33,585 patients attended the Injury Units, which exceeded the level of activity prior to the pandemic. I am advised that there has been an annual growth in activity of 36% at Nenagh so far this year and 19% at Ennis. In May 2022, both Ennis and Nenagh had their busiest months to date with over 1,200 attendances each.</p>  <p>  The new Injury Unit which opened at Ennis Hospital in April 2022 represents a &euro;2 million investment by the HSE in improving the clinical environment and the patient experience for these services. The HSE has confirmed that it remains committed to growing these services in their model 2 hospitals in the long-term.</p></reply>

The implementation of the EIP Model of Care is in line with Sharing the Vision. The EIP programme will ensure that people presenting with psychosis get rapid access to expert assessment and evidence based intervention including psychological interventions, family interventions, employment support, physical health support and medication.</p>  <p>  Early Intervention in Psychosis is an evidence-based approach that can transform the experiences and outcomes of people facing psychosis. Investment in this vital clinical programme can help reduce admissions to hospital, reduce relapses, prevent long-term disability and support people to stay in education and/or employment. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland an estimated 1,500 people develop psychotic disorder for the first time. Approximately 25 EIP services must be developed in Ireland to facilitate national implementation of this clinical programme, in line with Recommendation 52 of Sharing the Vision.</p>  <p>  There are currently 5 EIP services in place across CHOs 1, 4, 6, and 8. All are at various stages of development and resourcing in terms of progressing the Model of Care. Three of these EIP services formed part of an external evaluation, the report of which was launched on 22 September 2022. </p>  <p>  There is strong interest from clinicians to work on EIP teams and posts funded in 2022 are being progressed by each CHO. In some cases, backfilling of posts can take some time, resulting in gaps in teams. However, we continue to make positive progress in relation to recruitment for this important programme.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that the most effective way to reduce the impact of this disease is for those who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to self-isolate until 48 hours after symptoms have substantially or fully resolved, and for those who are eligible to receive their primary and booster doses. </p>  <p>  With regard to ventilation in the healthcare sector, it is one aspect of a suite of measures that are used in hospitals and other healthcare settings to mitigate the spread of respiratory infection, including COVID-19. It is important to remember that other preventative measures are still advised in healthcare settings, including respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and appropriate use of PPE, including face masks.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Division (AMRIC), publishes infection prevention and control guidance for healthcare settings. </p>  <p>  On 22nd September last, the AMRIC published the latest iteration of its Acute Hospital Infection Prevention and Control Precautions for possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases, which provides specific guidance with respect to ventilation in hospital settings. The guidance is published on the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s website and will continue to be regularly updated. The HSE implemented the guidance on 3rd October. </p>  <p>  Additionally, on 12th October, I published my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Approach to the Management of COVID-19 for Winter 2022/23. The Department&rsquo;s strategic objectives are presented thematically in the report. This report was informed by the work of the COVID-19 Advisory Group, whose multidisciplinary membership includes an expert on ventilation. Information is provided on ventilation under the heading of non-pharmaceutical interventions. </p>  <p>  The importance of ventilation as one measure within our overall layered response to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is also embedded in Government communications on the pandemic. This will continue to be the case in upcoming campaigns. </p></reply>

Considerable progress has been made on Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital, for Community Based Care and other healthcare settings. </p>  <p>  Following an open procurement process and Government decision, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Ireland have signed contracts with EPIC for the provision of an EHR System for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital. This will be the most extensive EHR deployment in Ireland and builds upon the success of EHR programmes at our largest maternity hospitals and St James&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>  <p>  The planned expansion of the use of electronic health records to maternity hospital sites at Limerick and the Coombe, in 2022 and 2023 will result in 70% of babies born in Ireland being assigned an electronic health record at birth. Contracts for clinical management systems capable of generating EHRs have also been signed for the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the National Forensics Hospitals. </p>  <p>  For community-based EHRs, a formal market soundings exercise was completed in Q1 2022 and a business case is under development. Separately almost all GPs practices use accredited GP Practice Systems capable of generating EHRs for patients. </p>  <p>  My Department is also giving consideration to a strategic approach to widening the roll-out of EHRs, interoperability of existing systems and market technology and systems advances in conjunction with the establishment of Regional Health Areas.</p></reply>

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Regional Health Areas across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, provided through the public health system. In this regard, funding was secured in Budget 2023 to support access to advanced AHR treatments, including, crucially, to allow the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care.</p>  <p>  This investment will facilitate the first steps to be taken towards the provision of a complete publicly-provided fertility service, which is the ultimate objective of Government. In particular, it will allow the historic development of the first National Advanced AHR Centre, delivering IVF and ICSI through a wholly public clinic. This is scheduled to open in the early part of 2024 and will provide a nationwide service, with all six Regional Fertility Hubs having equity of access for onward referral to it, via a shared care pathway. Subject to the provision of additional funding in future, it is envisaged that additional National Advanced AHR Centres will be developed and become operational on a phased basis elsewhere in the country.</p>  <p>  The 2023 allocation will also be utilised to support the Regional Fertility Hubs in order to expand their scope of services next year by introducing the provision of IUI (intrauterine insemination), a significant, yet less complex and less intrusive, component of AHR treatment. </p>  <p>  Separately, as an interim measure, I have instructed that some funding be made available to support access to advanced AHR treatment via private providers from September 2023. </p>  <p>  My officials, in conjunction with NWIHP, are now planning for the operationalisation of both the publicly- and privately- provided service, including the development of a national eligibility framework, as well as determining how the interim funding for private treatments will be provided to individual eligible patients. </p>  <p>  Overall, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader new AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available on the HSE website.</p><p>Separately, information will be available shortly for the other certain healthcare employees who are covered by the Government Decision, detailing the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This will cover eligible staff in six cohorts:<ol type="1"><li>Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</li><li>Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</li><li>Agency roles working in the HSE;</li><li>Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</li><li>Redeployed members of Defence Forces to work in the HSE;</li><li>Paramedics employed by Local Authorities</li></ol>The HSE has tendered for an external provider to assist in setting up and implementing the process of gathering required information from the relevant employers in cohorts 1-4 above, to facilitate payment of the Pandemic Recognition Payment to their eligible staff.  In accordance with public procurement guidelines, from the time a preferred tenderer is selected by the HSE, a standstill period of 14 days must also be observed before any contract can come into effect. I am eager for an efficient rollout to begin very shortly as this contract comes into force. </p></reply>

It is mainly associated with antibiotics but also occurs with other antimicrobials including antivirals and antifungals. Effective treatments are important to treat and prevent infections and minimise morbidly and mortality (e.g. sepsis). They are also required for the delivery of many modern healthcare interventions, including chemotherapy, major surgery, organ transplantation and neonatal care. </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. In recognition of the serious challenge posed by AMR, AMR has been included in Ireland&rsquo;s National Risk Assessment since 2014.</p><p>National Action Plans on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) are an international commitment for Member Stares of both the European Commission and the WHO.  Ireland&rsquo;s first National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020, known as iNAP1, was developed jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and was published in October 2017.</p><p>The successor plan, Ireland&rsquo;s second One Health National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2021-2025, known as iNAP2, was published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in November 2021. Importantly, it includes learning from both the CPE and COVID-19 Public Health Emergencies and the Report of the European Commission / European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control One Health Country Monitoring Visit on AMR to Ireland in 2019. It also aligns with the Department of Health Statement of Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2023 and the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.</p><p>Both plans adopt a One Health approach and align to the five Strategic Objectives as outlined in the WHO Global Action Plan (2015) and the requirements of the European Action Plan on AMR (2017). iNAP2 includes 90 actions specific to human health across these objectives. In addition, it also includes 15 One Health actions agreed across the human health, animal health and environment sectors.</p><p>The goal of the One Health concept is to encourage multidisciplinary collaborative efforts across different sectors such as human health, animal health, agriculture, and the environment to achieve the optimal health outcomes for people and animals. It advocates a &ldquo;whole of society&rdquo; approach, recognising that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. It has been acknowledged globally that a One Health approach is the most effective way to address the global AMR challenge. This is promoted by both the WHO and the European Commission. </p><p>The human health actions in iNAP2 have been developed through engagement with internal and external stakeholders and the expert advisory input of the Patient Safety Council. </p><p>The approach to iNAP2 actions was based on three Guiding Principles:<ol type="1"><li>Patient-centred approach, founded on integrated care in line with Sl&aacute;intecare;</li> <li>Developing iNAP2 with a focus on people, including patients, service users, staff, stakeholders and the public;</li><li>Ensuring that learning from the COVID-19 Pandemic is incorporated, focusing on infection prevention and control as an enabler for safe care.</li></ol>A mid-term review of the Human Health actions in iNAP2 is planned for 2023. This will ensure that ongoing learnings from the COVID-19 Pandemic are captured to inform the remainder of the lifecycle of the Plan. </p><p>On the same day as the publication of iNAP2, the HSE published the HSE 2022-2025 Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control (AMRIC) Action Plan. This supports the delivery of iNAP2 and outlines the delivery and implementation of the human health actions under their remit.</p><p>Since 2018, there has been over &euro;25m in new development funding to support activities in the Human Health sector including the funding and approval for the recruitment of 345 additional full-time posts across a range of IPC and AMR roles.</p><p>Antimicrobial Resistance poses a significant challenge to human, animal, and environmental health. iNAP2 provides the roadmap to help address this challenge over the lifecycle of the plan. The Department of Health is committed to continuing to work with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and HSE AMRIC, and to engaging with other stakeholders across the One Health sectors, to progress implementation of the actions under iNAP2. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000061#WRG01600"><p>I am acutely aware of the specific challenges faced by the nursing homes sector related to price inflation and increased energy costs. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support. </p>  <p>  Substantial additional supports have also been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 saw an additional &euro;180 million of funding for services for older people for winter 2022 and into 2023, building on unprecedented increases of recent years. This will bring investment in these services to over &euro;2.4 billion in 2023, including nearly &euro;12 million of new developments. Prior to Budget Day Minister Butler stated that her priority was to secure additional funding for Budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to a high standard. Long-term residential care will be supported through additional funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.</p>  <p>  In addition, a significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based service providers who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community.</p>  <p>  The details of the plan are being finalised. It is proposed that the inflation support fund will be administered by the HSE utilising the mechanisms in place for funding eligible organisations in receipt of Service Level Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements. These arrangements are already in place with organisations that provide key health and social care services for people in Ireland.  It is proposed that payments will be made to eligible organisations in the final quarter of 2022 to meet the pressures of this coming winter. Many eligible organisations may be already operating within a context of increased inflationary pressures, while others may only begin to experience same as winter progresses.</p>  <p>  For providers of long-term residential care who participate in the nursing home support scheme, funding will be allocated through the established mechanism of the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme. Precise details of the scheme are being finalised and will be communicated in the coming days.</p>  <p>  To address strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) was established in March 2022 and published a report on October 15th outlining 16 key recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment and retention, pay and conditions and overall sectoral reform. I strongly endorse the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to address the critical shortage of care workers in Ireland and a dedicated Implementation Group will start to progress these immediately.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home, local market prices, historic prices and overall budgetary capacity. </p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence, and there is no role for Ministers or the Department of Health in these negotiations. The Department of Health published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system which are now being taken forward by the Department of Health and the NTPF.  </p></reply>

This report provides an important opportunity for a renewed focus on measures to improve the quality and safety of emergency services delivered to the people of the Midwest region by University Hospital Limerick. </p>  <p>  The Deloitte review was commissioned by the CEO of the University of Limerick Hospital Group in March this year. The primary objectives of the review were to identify the source of patient flow challenges in UHL and determine possible opportunities to enhance the existing approach and reflect on the effectiveness and impact of patient flow initiatives introduced to date. The report includes recommendations relating to process, supporting infrastructure, staffing, and ICT. While some of the recommendations can be implemented locally, others require an integrated response with community services.</p>  <p>  In parallel to this review, the HSE&rsquo;s Performance Management and Improvement Unit (PMIU) has led an intensive engagement with UHL team members throughout the summer in response to my concerns about the hospital raised with the HSE in April this year.</p>  <p>  The PMIU are cognisant of both the findings and recommendations of the Deloitte report and those of the HIQA report following HIQA's unannounced inspection of the ED in Limerick in March. The recommendations of these reviews will continue to inform planning for University Hospital Limerick, including the bespoke initiatives for UL Hospitals Group and CHO Mid-West that form part of the HSE Winter Plan 2022/2023 and the longer-term national 3-year Unscheduled Care Improvement Plan that is in development by the HSE.</p></reply>

The scheme will be expanded to cover all children aged 6 and 7 by the end of 2022 and, from 1 April 2023, eligibility will be extended to people who earn the median household income of &euro;46,000 or less. It will be adjusted for people living alone and for those with children; further operational details will be made available prior to the commencement of the income-based expansion.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that these measures will be supported by a significant package of additional capacity supports to GP practices. Engagement with the GP representative organsisation is expected to continue to determine how best to utilise these additional supports.</p>  <p>  The proposed package of capacity supports announced in Budget 2023 builds on steps already taken by the Government to increase the number of GPs working throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement the additional annual expenditure provided for general practice will have increased to &euro;211.6m per annum by 2023. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022.  Following the transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, preparatory work has commenced on a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a sustainable general practice.</p></reply>

It is in the early stages of design development under the Public Spending Code (PSC) lifecycle. </p><p>The updated PSC aims to ensure that maximum value for money can be achieved for the taxpayer through disciplined project evaluation, preparation and implementation. The PSC outlines the processes, decision gates, and requirements at each of those gates for capital investment proposals in excess of &euro;100m. The requirements of each of these stages must be comprehensively addressed in order to receive approval-in-principle to proceed to the next stage of the PSC. </p><p>The original proposal was for a new multi-story ED block at an estimated cost of &euro;65-&euro;120m. However, as a result of service-led demands, there has been very significant increase in the scale and ambition for the Galway site and the proposal now incorporates a new ED, a new Maternity Department, and a new Paediatric Department, and would likely require capital investment in the order of hundreds of millions of euro.</p><p>In the meantime, an interim ED, which can serve as enabling work for the larger proposal, was substantially completed in July 2022 and, after a commissioning/equipping/training phase, opened earlier this month- over the weekend of 8-9 October. This interim ED has more capacity with 43-patient bays compared to 34-bays in the pre-COVID ED. It will also provide 43 single, closed cubicles and extra resuscitation bays, providing greater dignity and privacy for patients.</p><p>The ambition for the proposal at UHG and the investment required is therefore not insignificant. Investment decisions must be clearly linked to core national policy objectives. The Strategic Assessment Report for this proposal is still being reviewed to determine its alignment with the various national strategies and policies that the proposal crosscuts. It is expected that this will be concluded in coming weeks.</p><p>Once the Departmental review of the SAR is complete, it will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) for review. If DPER finds that the SAR provides a basis to proceed, approval to develop the proposal by means of a Preliminary Business Case at Decision Gate 1 of the PSC can be granted.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that certain rural GMS vacancies can be difficult to fill. As of the 1st of October, there were 25 GMS GP vacancies, 13 of which were in rural areas. For this reason, in addition to the more general measures taken to increase the number of GPs in the State and the significant increases in investment into general practice, specific supports are in place to support GPs in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was introduced previously to support rural GPs, these supports have been increased by 10% under the 2019 GP Agreement. In addition, practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking. Specific fees are also in place for dispensing doctors (who operate in rural areas), these have been increased by 28% under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are preparing to commence shortly a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice in general and in rural areas specifically, and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a better general practice.</p></reply>

This aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged and ensure greater capacity in the future. It will also help to address waiting lists on a national level through the provision of dedicated, standalone facilities in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  The development of the elective hospital proposals is following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code. This sets out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects. A Programme Preliminary Business Case has been reviewed by my Department and shared with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A project-level Preliminary Business Case for Cork is now complete and has been reviewed under the newly introduced External Assurance Process. Feedback from the review has been incorporated as required and the PBC has been submitted for review by the Department of Public Expenditure&rsquo;s Major Projects Advisory Group. Once this process has concluded, a Memorandum will be brought to Government for its consideration/approval, including a recommendation on a site option in Cork.</p>  <p>  In parallel, work has also commenced to ensure a smooth transition to the next phase of Public Spending Code Gate 2 - Detailed Project Design, Planning and Procurement - and to ensure the necessary structures and workstreams can be progressed at pace, including articulating the clinical service and operating model including separation of scheduled and unscheduled care pathways, procurement strategy, design for planning approvals and stakeholder engagement arrangements.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate a timeline for the design, applying for planning and building of the new facilities; however, based on current plans it is intended that they would open in 2027 and be fully operational from 2028.</p></reply>

Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and ED pressures, which have negatively impacted scheduled care activity in our hospitals this year, the priority for the HSE and NTPF is to deliver as much activity as possible to reduce waiting times and the number of people waiting for acute scheduled care by year-end. </p>  <p>  New capacity to further reduce waiting lists in 2023, along with associated estimates on the number of additional appointments and procedures expected to be delivered next year, will be developed as part of agreeing the 2023 Waiting List Action Plan with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). </p>  <p>  The most critical health priority for 2023 is to ensure the full delivery of this new Waiting List Action Plan which will include: short-term measures to address acute scheduled care waiting list backlogs; priority actions in relation to Obesity/Bariatrics, Spina Bifida/Scoliosis and Gynaecology; as well longer-term reforms to enhance capacity and streamline and reconfigure acute scheduled care pathways.</p>  <p>  For 2023, funding of &euro;443 million has been allocated to tackle Waiting Lists. This includes:</p>  <p>  - &euro;123 million in funding for delivery of the Waiting List Action Plan, including priority areas such as Obesity/Bariatrics, Spina Bifida/Scoliosis and Gynaecology, as well as progressing longer-term reforms to sustainably enhance capacity.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p></reply>

My department is committed to supporting the health of the population through the provision of graduates with the key competencies and skills to be effective in the health workforce and to support a range of clinical teams in our health services. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department engage on an ongoing basis with colleagues in the HSE, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other relevant stakeholders including the Irish Medical Schools and Higher Education Institutions to ensure that we train enough graduates with the skills necessary to support the delivery of our health and social care services and to develop a strategic approach to workforce planning for the health sector.</p>  <p>  Ongoing discussions between both Departments are in relation to increasing domestic supply on health-related courses such as medicine, nursing and health and social care disciplines in the short term to medium term, through the immediate provision of additional places, and the longer-term planning being undertaken around future skills needs in the context of future demand for health and social care services.</p>  <p>  Working collaboratively with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the higher education sector, we have already made good progress in putting in place a multi-annual plan to deliver more medical places.  In July, Government approved an agreement between the Department of Health and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Medical Schools to phase in an increase of 200 additional Irish/EU medicine places. The first phase has seen an additional 60 places offered in September 2022.  The Medical Schools and both Departments have agreed to explore the potential to maximise the phasing in of these places in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Further permanent additional places on healthcare disciplines were announced in July, including 135 places on nursing programmes commencing from September 2022. Significant engagement is ongoing between my department, NMBI and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in relation to a sustainable introduction of further additional places on nursing programmes.</p>  <p>  The availability clinical placement supports are key enablers of this expansion, and engagement across my Department, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the HSE and Higher Education Sector is ongoing. The Department of Health is continuing to work closely with officials in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science on other emerging workforce planning requirements including the provision of appropriate clinical placements for Health and Social Care Professionals.  A workshop on clinical placement issues is planned in the coming weeks and will involve the HSE and higher education providers. </p>  <p>  Health and social care courses are by their nature complex in delivery. Securing appropriate long-term clinical placements is a key element in unlocking additional provision.  It is important that any increases in places are introduced in a sustainable way so that Higher Education Institutions can build appropriate staffing capacity.</p></reply>

The evidence reviews were published in October 2020 and found that:</p>  <p>  - Electronic cigarettes are not harmless to users, but there is evidence that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.</p>  <p>  - Electronic cigarettes appear to be as effective as nicotine replacement therapies for assisting smoking cessation for an observed period of up to 6 months. Further study is required to determine their effectiveness over a longer period.</p>  <p>  - There appears to be an association between the use of electronic cigarettes and subsequent smoking among adolescents.</p>  <p>  The reviews highlighted the need for further research to establish the long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes. My Department monitors, on an ongoing basis, the emerging international research and evidence in relation to these products.</p>  <p>  The prevalence of electronic cigarette use amongst young people is monitored via the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) and the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study (HBSC), which both take place every four years.

This Framework will build on the extensive research and papers recently published by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service which looked at areas including historical investment in health, investment criteria, capacity and condition of assets across the sector and regions.</p>  <p>  The Framework will set out criteria for use in assessing investment proposals including patient safety and regulatory requirements, regional/population requirements and climate action considerations.</p>  <p>  The Framework will enhance transparency and efficiency in the consideration and selection of healthcare infrastructure investment proposals and ensuring alignment with National Planning Framework and National Development Plan Strategic Outcomes and health policies and strategies.</p>  <p>  My Department are continuing to engage with stakeholders on the Framework prior to its publication and implementation, which is expected in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Currently there are 2,529 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme.</p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. As of the 1st of October, there are 25 GMS GP vacancies, approximately 1 percent of GMS panels, with one vacancy in each of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement the additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  In addition, a steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. Following the transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I have asked the Health Service Executive to provide the Deputy with an update in relation to the GMS GP vacancies in the area concerned and the provision of the NEDOC out-of-hours GP service, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I am aware that a significant number of dentists chose to leave the Scheme during the pandemic, which led to difficulties for medical card patients in accessing dental care in some parts of the country. Following discussion with the Irish Dental Association, a &euro;26 million package of additional investment in and expansion of the Scheme came into effect from 1st May 2022, over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021. </p>  <p>  While the number of dentists submitting claims under the scheme has not yet increased, the numbers of patients being seen and the numbers of treatments being provided under the DTSS have both increased in recent months. This indicates the measures have had some positive impact on patient access to care.</p>  <p>  However, these are interim measures and I recognise that there is a need to substantively review and reform the DTSS to align with best international evidence and practice. It is my intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy, which sets out a body of substantial services reform. An unprecedented allocation of &euro;15 million has been made in Budget 2023 to enhance the provision of oral healthcare services. On top of this &euro;15 million allocation, resources will also be made available for new clinical leadership posts and for other supporting staff to allow substantive reform of the provision of public oral healthcare services to all ages to commence.</p>  <p>  The HSE will assist patients who are still having difficulties accessing services and may provide emergency dental services directly to patients where necessary. I have secured an additional &euro;5 million in Budget 2023 to help enable provision of such emergency care. </p></reply>

This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home</p>  <p>  - Local market prices</p>  <p>  - Historic prices</p>  <p>  - Overall budgetary capacity</p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations. However, the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.</p>  <p>  At present, the NTPF has regard to prices at county level when assessing &lsquo;local market price&rsquo; (one of the 4 criteria outlined directly above, that is used in determining a nursing home&rsquo;s agreed maximum price). However, disparities within a county (particularly between urban and rural areas) can mean that such prices do not always reflect the reality of local variations in cost. In this recommendation, the NTPF proposed undertaking a formal assessment of an alternative model where the local market price would be based on the prices of nursing homes within a specific radius, rather than at county level. </p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made on this recommendation, with systems developed that will allow an accurate estimate of the overall price impact of an alternative geographical pricing model. Once these systems have been put in place, a report will be submitted to the Minister for Health making further recommendations on implementing changes to the pricing system. </p></reply>

Currently there are 2,529 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement the additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  In addition, a steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. Following the transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, preparatory work has commenced on a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The review, with input from key stakeholders, will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a sustainable general practice.</p></reply>

I fully agree with the Deputy's assertion that we must ensure that the decarbonisation and digitalisation of Ireland's economy and society are complimentary and in harmony with environmental policy. The 'Government Statement on the role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' sets out how we intend to do that, and I would encourage the deputy to review the full Statement which is on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  As the deputy alludes to, data centre operations are at the very centre of these transformational twin transitions in our economy and society. </p>  <p>  Data centres serve a key infrastructure role in our society. Digitalisation can unlock decarbonisation opportunities and present opportunities for reducing carbon emissions in areas such as increased remote working, reduced business travel and in the digitalisation of our supply chains. However, I am also very conscious that in the short to medium term, the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity grid, security of supply concerns, and our determination to decarbonise our electricity system, means that not all demand for data centre development can be accommodated sustainably.</p>  <p>  The revised Statement advises that the recently published sectoral emissions ceilings will be a constraint on growth of the data centre sector, and the measures outlined in the Statement are aimed at requiring the sector to invest in decarbonised energy solutions, embrace demand-flexibility and increase efficiency.</p>  <p>  The principles for sustainable data centre development outlined in the Statement provide clear guidance for planning decision makers and system operators as to the Government&rsquo;s priority for sustainable future developments, ensuring that data centres in Ireland contribute positively towards the green and digital transformation in our society and economy.</p>  <p>  We see measures such as &lsquo;demand flexibility&rsquo; as a pathway to decarbonisation. Demand flexibility will incentivise and enable Data centres to avoid consumption of electricity from the power system during times of system stress. Helping mitigate their impact on security of supply to some extent, with the power system less likely to face generation shortages at peak times.</p>  <p>  Its important to acknowledge that some data centre operators are corporate leaders in decarbonising data, many of have committed to net zero carbon and 100% renewable energy goals. It is this Government&rsquo;s intention to harness this ambition where possible, and for data centres to contribute to our national objectives by facilitating investment in renewable energy, energy storage, &lsquo;energy parks&rsquo; and other efficient and sustainable development opportunities.</p></reply>

The scheme uses the single identifier of the Meter Point Registration Number (MPRN) to ensure it can be administered automatically and without an application/approval process. This mechanism allowed payments to be made automatically to 2,138,939 domestic electricity accounts, over 99.36% of eligible accounts, under the first scheme which operated between April and June of this year. </p><p>The scheme is operated by the electricity Distribution System Operator, ESB Networks, and electricity suppliers, with oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).</p><p>  If the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit payment exceeds the balance on an electricity account, the resulting credit will be carried forward on that account. It is not being applied to domestic gas accounts on the basis that it is intended to be a universal support. Not all consumers use gas but electricity is supplied to all households. </p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department of Transport and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to enable owners of small public service vehicles, such as taxis, hackneys and limousines, to buy electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the terms and conditions of the eSPSV grant scheme, applicants may be granted one extension for a three-month period in which to complete and finalise their application.  Given the difficulties in obtaining vehicles, extensions have been granted on a case by cases basis, but only up to three months; and where proof is provided that a vehicle is on order and the date it will become available. No further extensions are available after this time period on the original application. If the application process is timed out an individual is able to reapply to the scheme and will be considered a new applicant for the purpose of the scheme. No extensions will be granted past 2022. Applicants can apply under the new scheme in 2023. </p>  <p>  Queries on any individual cases should be directed to the NTA as the scheme administrators.</p></reply>

A further reduction of 1 cent per litre (VAT inclusive) applied from 1 April 2022 to offset the impact of anticipated increased prices as a result of the increase in the Biofuel Obligation Scheme administered by my colleague, the Minister or the Environment, Climate and Communications.  These reductions were due to expire on 12 October 2022 but in recognition of the continued impact of high fuel costs on society, I have extended the reductions until 28 February 2023.</p>  <p>  According to the European Commission weekly oil bulletin published today 20 October 2022,  average national prices in Ireland are &euro;1.82 per litre on petrol and &euro;1.97 on diesel. While garages are not committing an offence by charging a higher price than competitors, all garages must operate within the bounds of consumer protection and competition law in relation to their pricing policies and practices.  </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory independent body responsible for the promotion of consumer rights and the enforcement of consumer law. The CCPC provides information on consumer rights and enforces consumer protection laws, including rules on pricing and deceptive trading practices.   </p>  <p>  If an individual believes that a breach of their consumer rights has occurred, they may make a complaint directly to the business concerned, but also to the CCPC.  The CPCC provides advice and guidelines on the process of making a complaint. Full information is available at: www.ccpc.ie</p>  <p>  With regard to the haulage sector, the Government has put in place several measures to ease cost pressures including:</p>  <p>  - On 15 March 2022, the Government introduced the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport and provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. There was good uptake of the scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to c. 3,080 operators (approx. 80% of licensed operators.)</p>  <p>  - The Diesel Rebate Scheme (&lsquo;DRS&rsquo;) has been in operation since 2013 and remains available to qualifying road haulage and passenger transport operators. The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby the rebate kicks in when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 VAT exclusive and the repayment amount increases gradually as the retail price increases up to a maximum repayment amount of 7.5 cents per litre.  Budget 2020 provided for a significant enhancement to the scheme whereby the marginal rate of compensation was doubled at prices over &euro;1.07 VAT exclusive.  This enhancement has been maintained to date in light of the current challenges facing sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  - VAT registered businesses are also entitled to recover the cost of VAT on the purchase of diesel, used in the course of their business, as is the case with most business costs.</p>  <p>  - The extended excise reduction on diesel also benefits hauliers.    </p>  <p>  The Government does not have infinite resources but through the measures outlined it has responded to help to ease the impact of high fuel prices.   </p></reply>

The Central Bank has also put in place a range of measures, including the Consumer Protection Code, in order to protect consumers who are taking out or already have a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework also seeks to ensure that lenders are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle. </p>  <p>  Where a loan is sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the regulatory protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new owner. Consumers whose loans are sold or transferred, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA). </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has said that it expects that all regulated entities take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers (existing and new) and communicate clearly, effectively, and in a timely manner with all customers. </p></reply>

Concerns regarding potential obstructions or other hazards that might contribute to flooding in the context of a severe weather event should be brought to the attention of the relevant local authority. Under the Government&rsquo;s Framework for Major Emergency Management, each local authority is designated the Lead Agency for co-ordinating the response to flood events within its functional area. </p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of arterial drainage schemes and flood relief schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995, as amended.  Arterial drainage maintenance is an ongoing programme of works of a cyclical nature, typically every four to six years. Each year, the OPW prepares an annual arterial drainage maintenance programme for each region that identifies the proposed maintenance locations within each arterial drainage scheme catchment area. The annual maintenance programme is informed by data gathered from a variety of sources, including maintenance records, observations from inspections and from information provided by members of the public. In addition to these planned maintenance activities, the OPW may also carry out maintenance work where necessary to address issues that come to its attention.</p><p>This maintenance work is organised on a regional basis at locations in Mungret, Co. Limerick, Headford, Co. Galway and Trim, Co. Meath. Concerns regarding potential obstructions or other hazards on a channel that is maintained by the OPW should be brought to the attention of the OPW at floodinfo@opw.ie.  An online map of the country with detailed information on the location of schemes maintained by the OPW can be found on <i>www.floodinfo.ie</i>.  </p><p>Riparian owners of land also have an important role in ensuring that watercourses are managed and free flowing so that in extreme weather events the risk of flooding can be minimised.

Among other things, the Bill will establish a new multi-person Media Commission (to be known as Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n), dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, establish a regulatory framework for online safety, and update the regulatory frameworks for broadcasting and audiovisual on-demand media services.</p>  <p>  The OSMR Bill is currently progressing through the legislative process in the D&aacute;il, having been passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11 July 2022. I intend to progress the Bill to enactment before the end of the year. Following this, in Q1 2024 Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be formally established and commence its regulatory functions. This will involve the development of regulatory codes and rules which will complete the transposition of the revised AVMSD. It is expected that this work will be a priority of An Coimisi&uacute;n once formally established.</p>  <p>  Regarding the question on accessibility, Article 7 of the revised AVMSD requires Member States to take the following measures:</p>  <p>  -  Member States shall ensure, without undue delay, that services provided by media service providers under their jurisdiction are made continuously and progressively more accessible to persons with disabilities through proportionate measures;</p>  <p>  -  Member States shall ensure that media service providers report on a regular basis to the national regulatory authorities or bodies on the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1. By 19 December 2022 and every three years thereafter, Member States shall report to the Commission on the implementation of paragraph 1;</p>  <p>  -  Member States shall encourage media service providers to develop accessibility action plans in respect of continuously and progressively making their services more accessible to persons with disabilities. Any such action plan shall be communicated to national regulatory authorities or bodies;</p>  <p>  -  Each Member State shall designate a single, easily accessible, including by persons with disabilities, and publicly available online point of contact for providing information and receiving complaints regarding any accessibility issues referred to in this Article; and,</p>  <p>  -  Member States shall ensure that emergency information, including public communications and announcements in natural disaster situations, which is made available to the public through audiovisual media services, is provided in a manner which is accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Article 7 will be transposed into Irish law by section 9 of the OSMR Bill, which will insert section 46O into the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 46O will enable An Coimisi&uacute;n to make media service rules in relation to a number of matters including the accessibility of audiovisual media services in line with the requirements of the revised AVMSD.</p>  <p>  Until such time as these rules come into place, section 46O(13) will provide that the current Access Rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will continue to apply to broadcasters established in the State.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i)in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;(ii) in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and(iii)  can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant.  Capital funding is available in my Department to support additional social housing acquisitions.  </p><p>The Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 came into effect on 6 July 2022. Part 11 amended the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to, inter alia, extend the required termination notice period that tenants must receive (where there has been no breach of tenant obligations). In addition, from 6 July 2022, when landlords are serving a Notice of Termination on their tenants, they must also send a copy to the Residential Tenancies Board at the same time. Failure to send a copy to the RTB at the same time will invalidate the Notice of Termination. </p><p>Providing early intervention to people at risk of homelessness is a priority for Government and Local authorities oversee a range of homeless prevention and tenancy sustainment measures.  Many of these services are operated in partnership between local authorities and NGO service delivery partners and are funded by my Department. </p><p>The HAP Placefinder Service supports households experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, to identify and secure a HAP supported tenancy in the private rented market. Under the Placefinder service, all local authorities are provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for eligible households. I have also increased the HAP discretion rate from the previous 20%, to a maximum of 35% for all local authority areas. </p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All.</p><p>  Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p><p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p><p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p><p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing reviews of the schemes under it. Feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been very positive, with 304 applications reported at the start of October.</p><p>  Given that Pathway 4 of Housing for All is intended to support re-use of existing buildings and the synergy with the Government's Our Rural Future policy, I do see the sense in extending the eligibility for the scheme to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas to ensure we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible. In that context, I am pleased to say that the Government has decided to extend the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme and I expect to have that extension to cities and rural properties in place by November.</p><p>  Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority will be available to provide advice and information on the schemes and the application process.</p></reply>

In light of this limited response, a second call was opened on the 15th of July.  This call remains open to submissions, and as of the 19th of October 2022, 5 further proposals have been submitted.  </p>  <p>  In line with the agreed Housing Supply Clearing House process, all submitted proposals, including the proposal referred to by the Deputy, have been initially assessed to establish eligibility, identify the key issues for consideration and categorise the submissions. In this regard, a report is being prepared for submission to the Minister in the coming weeks to set out the initial assessment of the submitted proposals and the recommended course of action. Further updates will subsequently be provided to the persons who have made submissions in due course.</p></reply>

Our assessment has been that the situation on the ground is complex. The Embassy, along with our EU partners, continues to maintain engagement with all stakeholders, and to encourage all stakeholders to engage in inclusive dialogue in order to resolve the issues.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland and Colombia enjoy excellent, long-standing relations across a range of areas. Our cooperation in the area of peacebuilding and our support to the Colombian peace process is a key component of the bilateral relationship, and we recognise that addressing social, land-related and environmental issues is an essential component of Colombia&rsquo;s peace process, as is addressing the situation faced by human rights defenders, civil society groups, and minority and ethnic groups in Colombia. Our support to the peace process takes the form of funding to the EU and UN Trust Funds for peace, as well as funding to civil society involved in peacebuilding, the operation of a lesson-sharing programme to exchange on experiences in peacebuilding from the Northern Ireland context, and constructive engagement on the United Nations Security Council. Since the new Colombian Government took office in August, we have reiterated our steadfast support to supporting Peace Agreement implementation and our firm intention to remain a long-term partner in this regard.</p></reply>

The report published last month by the UN International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia presents further alarming details of the human rights and humanitarian situation, including reports of the use of starvation as a method of warfare as well as the systematic use of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence.  Over 13 million people in northern Ethiopia are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  The resurgence of hostilities in August has reversed the progress made since the declaration of a ceasefire in March and has had a serious impact on the delivery of humanitarian aid. The significant escalation of fighting in recent days is of particular concern and is having an increasingly dire impact on the civilian population. It is critical that humanitarian deliveries are able to urgently resume and that essential services are restored.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU, UN and wider international community to address the crisis, as well as engaging directly through our Embassy in Addis Ababa and other bilateral channels. I continue to raise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns with key interlocutors, and to advocate for full humanitarian access, an urgent end to violence, dialogue, accountability for atrocities, and ultimately a political solution to the conflict. I strongly support the African Union&rsquo;s mediation efforts, and encourage and support the EU, UN and others to assist this work. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently raised this crisis, and particularly the issue of humanitarian access, at the UN Security Council and within the European Union.</p>  <p>  The situation in Ethiopia was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 October, where I expressed support for ongoing EU efforts in supporting AU mediation, in coordination with the US and UN envoys, while also sharing concerns with other Foreign Ministers on the resurgence of violence.</p>  <p>  In addition to our work to ensure an international focus on resolving this crisis, Ireland continues to take action directly to alleviate the humanitarian toll of the conflict. We provided over &euro;40 million in assistance to Ethiopia last year, with a similar level of support this year.</p></reply>

It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>   On the 12th of July this year I brought to Government a High Level Action Plan and a Memo for Government both of which were approved.  As part of this, Government approved a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission, which will entail funding increases to reach a defence budget of c. &euro;1.5 billion (at January 2022 prices) by 2028 through the annual Estimates process.</p>  <p>  A civil/military Implementation Management Office (IMO) has been established to support the implementation of the overall transformation programme required to implement recommendations from the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  The High Level Action Plan also sets out all the recommendations contained within the report and designates a response of Accept, Accept in Principal, Further Evaluation or Revert. There are a number of recommendations contained in the report which may impact on the structure of the Defence Forces including that the structure of the Army be reviewed and, in that context, the disposition of Units across the Defence Forces may be considered.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion on this matter prior to completion of the ongoing process. </p></reply>

For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024.

It is the responsibility of the school Management Authority to ensure that all teaching posts will be filled. Vacancies may arise in schools as a result of additional teaching posts, retirements, teachers moving to another school, career breaks, job sharing arrangements, etc. Once a school has selected a successful candidate for a vacancy, they must provide the teacher&rsquo;s details to my Department in order to be set up on payroll.  These details are provided in an appointment form and include details of the teachers&rsquo; appointment, type of contract, Teaching Council registration details, bank details, etc. My Department gives an annual commitment to Schools, teachers, Unions and Education Partners that all correctly completed appointment forms received in Payroll Division in early July will be paid on the first pay date in September. For the 2022/2023 school year these dates were 8th July 2022 for Primary teachers and 1st July, 2022 for Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools teachers. It was not possible to set a relatively small number of these appointment forms up for the first pay date in September as the forms were incomplete. Difficulties were encountered in verifying details with schools or the teacher concerned as they were unavailable during the school summer closure period.</p>  <p>  Appointment forms received after the July dates are processed in date order of receipt and many are processed in time for salary payment on the first pay date of September, or as early as possible thereafter. There are many instances where a school forwards a appointment form after the school year has begun.</p>  <p>  My Department has received in the region of 10,000 appointment forms to date for the start of the 2022/2023 school year. In order to process this high volume in the months of July and August, the Payroll staff worked overtime during the week, at weekends and were constrained in taking leave. </p>  <p>  As appointment forms are submitted in paper format as well as by email and continue to be received and processed, I do not have data on the number of appointments that took more than two weeks to process. I can advise the Deputy however that once processed, the appointment has also to meet the payroll cutoff deadline date for inclusion in the next available pay run. This means that in most cases it will invariably take more than two weeks from date of receipt until processed and included in the next payroll for payment.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that staff in my Department are in direct contact with schools and teachers, on an ongoing basis. They are highly aware of the financial pressure that late payments of salary can place on teachers, especially newly qualified teachers and every effort is made to resolve issues as soon as possible and to ensure prompt payment. The majority of appointment applications have now been processed for the 2022/23 school year, and any outstanding applications are now being processed.</p></reply>

To qualify for the Fuel Allowance, an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the household composition criteria. This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  While the Department's schemes are reviewed on an ongoing basis there are no plans to grant automatic access to the Fuel Allowance payment without regard to the qualifying criteria set out above. Any decision to do so would change the targeted nature of the scheme and would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall welfare Budget 2023 package of almost &euro;2.2 Billion, I was delighted to announce a number of considerable reforms to the means threshold of the Fuel Allowance scheme which will benefit many pensioner households. These reforms include:</p>  <p>  - From January 2023, a new means threshold will be introduced for people aged 70 years and over. The new means threshold will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.</p>  <p>  - From January 2023, the standard means test for persons under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 from &euro;120 to &euro;200 over the maximum State Pension Contributory rate.</p>  <p>  - From January 2023, the Disablement Benefit payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.</p>  <p>  - From January 2023, the Half-Rate Carer's Allowance payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight that the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It gives extra financial support to families with children with rates depending on their incomes and family size.  It is not considered a long-term Social Protection payment and recipients are in full time employment and are more likely to have additional resources.  A person in receipt of the WFP can continue to receive the payment for 52 weeks even if their income increases. </p><p>While no provision was made in Budget 2023 to allow persons in receipt of the WFP to access the Fuel Allowance payment, as part of the overall Social Welfare Budget 2023 package of almost &euro;2.2 Billion, I was pleased to announce a number of measures in relation to the WFP.  In November 2022, people receiving the WFP will get a lump-sum payment of &euro;500 and, in January 2023, the WFP income limits will increase by &euro;40 across all family sizes. </p><p>For people parenting alone and who are on a social welfare scheme such as the One-Parent Family Payment, they may also receive the double-week payment in October and the Christmas Bonus in December. </p><p>Many of those on the WFP will also benefit from the non-social welfare cost of living measures announced in the Budget, such as the<b></b>enhanced electricity credits of &euro;600 which will be applied to electricity bills. </p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.738.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000068#WRO00400"><p>People with a disability who are self-employed, or considering self-employment, cannot avail of the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS).  This provision also applies to directors of limited companies who work as paid employees in their company.</p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is an employment support to private sector employers.  The objective of the scheme is to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities, who they may not otherwise consider due to a potential productivity loss.  The incentive is intended to encourage employers to take on new employees.  The scheme provides financial incentives to employers to hire new staff with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment.  The employee must be subject to and have the same rights as per the conditions of employment as any of their other employees.  These conditions include the payment of Class A PRSI contributions. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that my department provides a wide range of other employment-related supports for persons with disabilities seeking to enter self-employment. </p>  <p>  - Disability Allowance and Blind Pension</p>  <p>  Both Disability Allowance and Blind Pension are structured to support recipients to avail of their own employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375, are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test.  Earnings above &euro;375 are assessed at 100%. As part of Budget 2023, I have increased the earnings disregard for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension by &euro;25 per week, from &euro;140 to &euro;165.</p>  <p>  - Partial Capacity Benefit</p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme allows a person who has been in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, the latter for a minimum of 26 weeks, and who may not have full capacity for work, to enter or return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment.  The personal rate of payment of Partial Capacity Benefit is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction regarding their capacity for work and the payment they are moving from, i.e., Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit.  After the medical assessment, if a person's restriction regarding their capacity for work is rated as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% of their previous rate, respectively.  If assessed as &lsquo;mild&rsquo; they will not qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit. </p>  <p>  Partial Capacity Benefit has been designed so there are no restrictions/limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work under the scheme.  A person who participates on the scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.</p>  <p>  - Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)</p>  <p>  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme encourages people getting certain social welfare payments to become self-employed.  This includes persons in receipt of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  A person who avails of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme retains a percentage of their social welfare payment for up to 2 years.  Once accepted onto the scheme the person retains 100% of their original payment in year one and 75% in year two.</p>  <p>  - Reasonable Accommodations and Self Employment</p>  <p>  The Departments Reasonable Accommodation Fund includes the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant (WEAG).  Where a person with a disability is self-employed and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment they can apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment.  A grant of up to &euro;6,350 is available towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment.  It is important to note that applications from persons who are self-employed which may be in excess of this sum may be considered on an individual basis, up to a maximum of &euro;9,523, if specialist training for assistive technology is required.</p>  <p>  A review of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund is ongoing and it is expected that the review will be published before year end. </p>  <p>  As part of my department&rsquo;s commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, a review of the Wage Subsidy Scheme is currently being undertaken and a public consultation will be held in the coming months.  The public consultation will invite people with disabilities, employers, and the general public to share their views on the WSS.  These views will be used to inform the WSS review and the future of the scheme. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will keep my department&rsquo;s employment support schemes for people with disabilities under review, such as the WSS Review outlined above, to ensure that they continue to meet their policy objectives.  However, any potential changes to these schemes can only be considered in the wider budgetary and policy context. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This settlement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  This settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age are now able to apply for this payment.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, an administrative and ICT system to accept applications and process payments was put in place within the Department of Social Protection.  The first group of ex-gratia applications have been received - these relate to persons who retired since 2008.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Expenditure and Reform as regards the timing of issuing of these payments.</p>  <p>  A notification will issue to recipients as soon as the payments are processed.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is one of 21 contracts providing this service.

Though regrettable, my Department cannot direct the employment and staffing of third-party contractors.  In line with the contract the SDCP is required to sufficiently staff its employment service with appropriately qualified staff and comply with statutory employment provisions.  </p>  <p>  Once contracts were signed by IPLAESs, my Department issued upfront payments and provided every assistance to IPLAESs to mobilise services to the long term unemployed within their catchment areas.

I have personally met with a number of Family Resource Centres over recent months to discuss their concerns. This area of work is a significant priority for me, and for this Government.</p><p>The Government greatly appreciates the work of family resource centres and the work of all the community and voluntary bodies funded by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>As you mention, I have secured an additional &euro;37 million in funding for Tusla in budget 2023. The net funding available to Tusla is determined annually as part of the estimates process and notified to the agency through my annual Performance Statement. In response to the Performance Statement, Tusla will prepare a Business Plan for 2023 and as always family resource centres will be a component. Funds are limited and there are increasing demands for essential services provided by Tusla.</p><p>Throughout 2018 and 2019, my Department  provided Tusla with an additional &euro;4.5 million to invest in the family resource centres programme. This funding facilitated the expansion of that programme to 121 family resource centres and provided additional supports in core funding for existing family resource centres.</p><p>In 2020 and 2021, Tusla provided additional supports as needed to family resource centres and other funded community and voluntary partners to assist with pressures arising from Covid-19.</p><p>In 2021, Tusla had a core budget of &euro;18 million for the family resource centres programme. An additional 4% in funding was allocated to the family resource centres in 2022 to target sustainability.</p><p>Family resource centres have also benefited from Dormant Account funding &euro;650,000 in 2021 and &euro;1 million in 2022. </p><p>I am aware that family resource centres are providing significant levels of assistance on the ground in communities who are welcoming Ukrainian people and I have asked Tusla to continue to support Family Resource Centres in those efforts. I am seeking funding for family resource centres for this purpose during discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure.</p><p>It must be noted other Government bodies also provide substantial funding to family resource centres to deliver services on their behalf. In 2020 more then half of their funding came from non-Tusla sources such as Local Authorities, ETBs, the HSE, Pobal and the Dept. of Social Protection.</p><p>A spending review of Tusla-funded family support services is underway. This review will help inform future priorities for investment in these services.</p><p>I will continue to engage with Tusla, and family resource centres on the key issue of their funding and sustainability of the valuable services they provide to our communities.</p></reply>

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible.</p>  <p>  The Act allows the Government, by Order, to direct an intervention at a particular site where the criteria for manifestly inappropriate burials are met and to approve the appointment of a Director of Authorised Intervention to oversee and manage a phased, step-by-step approach to the excavation, recovery, analysis, identification (if possible) and re-interment of the remains. </p>  <p>  On 4 October, the Government made an order under the Act to establish an independent Office to lead an intervention at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway. The making of the Order follows on from Resolutions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad last month approving the draft Order that was agreed by Government in July. </p>  <p>  The Government order specifies that the functions of the Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam will include carrying out a DNA Identification Programme, which involves taking DNA samples from eligible family members and human remains buried at a site and analysis of those samples by Forensic Science Ireland. The purpose of the analysis is to compare DNA profiles to establish if there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at the site and the human remains that are recovered.  </p>  <p>  The Act defines an eligible family member as a person who has reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is a child, parent, sibling, half-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew (whether of the whole blood or the half-blood), grandniece or grandnephew of the person who is buried at an intervention site.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that Forensic Science Ireland can establish the Databases that will allow for DNA profile comparison. </p>  <p>  I intend to appoint a Director to head up the Office as soon as possible. Arrangements for the recruitment of a Director to head up the Office are currently being finalised and my officials are liaising with the Public Appointments Service in this regard. It is expected that once the post is advertised, the appointment of a Director will take a number of weeks. When appointed, the Director will make arrangements for a public information campaign to promote awareness of the Identification Programme, including how family members can notify the Director of his or her interest in participating in the Programme, in line with the provisions of the Act. </p></reply>

The Scheme will stand in recognition of time spent, harsh conditions, emotional abuse and all other forms of harm, mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced while resident in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution. The graduated payment rates under the Scheme proportionately acknowledge the more prolonged experience of harsh institutional conditions which were endured by those who spent longer periods of time in these institutions.</p><p>In relation to children who spent less than six months in an institution and who were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family, the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed, through extensive engagement with those concerned, is access to records. So for those children who spent short periods of time in an institution during their infancy, the Action Plan provides a response to their needs in the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 and the investment which has been made available to support implementation of this legislation. The legislation provides guaranteed access to birth certificates, as well as wider birth and early life information for those who have questions in relation to their origins.  It also supports contact and family reunion, where that is the wish of both parties, by means of the new statutory tracing service and Contact Preference Register. </p><p>It should also be underlined that free counselling support has been in place since before the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report, through the National Counselling Service in the HSE. This is free of charge, includes out of hours support and those who identify themselves as survivors of the institutions are prioritised for the next available counselling space. Counselling support is also being provided to survivors, former residents and adopted persons by Barnardos, Tusla and AAI under the auspices of the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.</p></reply>

This will allow a person to make an application in respect of time spent as a relevant person in that additional institution.  Section 15 then provides a related provision in allowing for an applicant to submit a second application in a case where they were also resident in an institution that has been added to the Schedule.</p></reply>

The National Childcare Scheme is designed to implement various adjustments reflecting the policy decisions and priorities of Government. Such adjustments may be to subsidies or income thresholds amongst other things</p><p>Budget 2023 introduced enhancements to NCS subsidies which will come into effect on 2 January 2023. From this date, all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive an NCS subsidy of at least &euro;1.40. </p><p>There are two types of subsidies available to parents:</p><p><b>- Universal subsidies </b>are available to all families with children between 24 weeks and 15 years of age. This subsidy is not means tested and currently provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week. This will rise to &euro;1.40 per hour from 2 January 2023.</p><p>- Alternatively,<b>Income Assessed Subsidies</b>are available to families with children  aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on the applicant&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The ratewill vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in a family. It can be used towards the cost of a Tusla registered childcare place for up to a  maximum of 45 hours per week. To apply for an Income Assessed subsidy, the applicant&rsquo;s reckonable family income has to be less than &euro;60,000.</p><p>The current subsidy rates are: <table>    <tr>       <th>Reckonable income</th>       <th>&euro;26,000 or below</th>       <th>&euro;26,000 &ndash; &euro;60,000</th>       <th>Over &euro;60,000</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24-52 weeks old</td>       <td>&euro;5.10 </td>       <td>&euro;5.10 - &euro;0.50</td>       <td>&euro;0.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 to 2 years old</td>       <td>&euro;4.35 </td>       <td>&euro;4.35 - &euro;0.50</td>       <td>&euro;0.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years old or older</td>       <td>&euro;3.95 </td>       <td>&euro;3.95- &euro;0.50</td>       <td>&euro;0.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>At school (or older than 6 and   less than 15)</td>       <td>&euro;3.75 </td>       <td>&euro;3.75- &euro;0.50</td>       <td>&euro;0.50 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>From January 2<sup>nd</sup>2023 the subsidy rates will be: <table>    <tr>       <th>Reckonable income</th>       <th>&euro;26,000 or below</th>       <th>&euro;26,000 &ndash; &euro;60,000</th>       <th>Over &euro;60,000</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24-52 weeks old</td>       <td>&euro;5.10 </td>       <td>&euro;5.10 - &euro;1.40</td>       <td>&euro;1.40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 to 2 years old</td>       <td>&euro;4.35 </td>       <td>&euro;4.35 - &euro;1.40</td>       <td>&euro;1.40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years old or older</td>       <td>&euro;3.95 </td>       <td>&euro;3.95- &euro;1.40</td>       <td>&euro;1.40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>At school (or older than 6 and   less than 15)</td>       <td>&euro;3.75 </td>       <td>&euro;3.75- &euro;1.40</td>       <td>&euro;1.40 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For income-assessed awards, the highest levels of subsidy will go to families at or below the minimum reckonable income threshold of &euro;26,000, with the level of subsidy tapering down to the minimum subsidy rate as income rises towards the maximum net income threshold of &euro;60,000. The extension of eligibility for the universal subsidy to all children under 15 coupled with the increase to &euro;1.40 will mean the taper rate for those with a net income of &euro;60,000 and above will be further reduced. This is because this group will see the highest reduction in weekly childcare costs as a result of the increase. These changes avoid a step effect for those whose incomes fall just outside the eligibility for income assessed subsidies. </p><p>Under the NCS, &ldquo;Reckonable income&rdquo; refers to the income that will be assessed when an application is made. It comprises of family income, including Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, after tax, PRSI, USC, and any allowable items under the Scheme have been deducted. A full list of income deductions and exclusions is available on www.ncs.gov.ie/faqs.</p><p>&quot;Allowable deductions&quot; to income assessment are permitted  and a list of these are provided in Schedule 1 of the Childcare Support Act 2018. Broadly it includes income tax, pension deductions,  and certain grants for education and labour activation.</p></reply>

Governance structures have put in place in the form of a Programme Board which includes representation from the NGO sector and an External Advisory Committee to oversee transition to the new system. The Board has met regularly over the past 15 months to review progress. </p><p>In order to secure the accommodation required, intensive cooperation has been underway with key implementation partners such as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the Local Authorities to develop the new accommodation model and support services. This work has included the development of an acquisition policy, a Local Authority Allocation key, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. In collaboration with the Housing Agency a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies is being developed. </p><p>Planning advanced on the acquisition of a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation, the integration support system that will apply including the launch in August 2022 of a &euro;1m integration fund. The aim of this fund is to fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants. The awards will be announced shortly.</p><p>As will be appreciated, the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for the implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have been temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White paper Transition Team. Upwards of 54,000 people displaced by the war in Ukraine have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and in excess of 42,000 have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State.  Alongside this, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people seeking international protection with over 11,500 arrivals in the first three quarters of 2022 alone. Overall my department is now accommodating over 60,000 people, compared with 7,500 at this time last year. The Department is working diligently to manage the response to the Ukraine crisis whilst continuing to progress the aims of the White Paper. </p><p>In this vastly changed context an overall review of the projected timelines and deliverables in the White Paper is currently underway. This is a complex exercise that will take account of both the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the substantial increase in numbers seeking International Protection. </p><p>An initial paper with some options and recommendations has been brought to the White Paper Programme Board for their input and feedback. </p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for the department.</p></reply>

It will allows the Minister to make certain other amendments to give effect to a determination of the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under <i>section 33(1)</i>of the <i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005  </i>(which deals with the distribution of Garda members throughout the State). </p><p>The purpose of this section is to provide for the making of a statutory instrument to amend other statutory instruments that refer to the word &lsquo;district&rsquo; or specific Garda ranks to reflect the changes to the organisational structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na brought about by the introduction of the new Garda operating model.  It is intended that any such amendments will be along the same lines as those being made in the Schedules to the Act.</p><p>To date, no statutory instruments under section 9 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Functions and Operational Areas) Act 2022 have been made.</p><p>Following discussions with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and within my Department, it is my intention to make Regulations under section 9 at the same time as the Act is commenced in its entirety once the new operating model has been rolled out nationwide.</p><p>Work has been underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) for some time to prepare for and implement the new organisational structure. The model was announced by the Commissioner in August 2019. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new operating model reflects and addresses the challenges of modern day policing by enabling specialisation in the delivery of key services and freeing up more Garda&iacute; to focus on front line policing. </p><p>It will particularly enhance the investigation of crime through the delivery of a greater range of specialised services in local areas such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cyber-crime, and economic crime. </p><p>The Operating Model is designed to make each Division the central unit of policing administration, rather than the current smaller District model, to benefit from greater scale. This is to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive policing service and will help strengthen the focus on community policing.</p><p>The development and introduction of the Operating Model was a recommendation by both the Garda Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI). </p><p>Its focus is on community policing based on local needs consistent with the objective of &ldquo;Keeping People Safe&rdquo; by working closely with wider services to prevent crime and support vulnerable people. The model will also facilitate more effective streamlining of administrative processes and reduce bureaucracy.</p><p>Under the Model, all services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level, to allow greater specialisation and to release Garda&iacute; from back office functions, and Garda Districts will no longer form part of the organisational structure.</p><p>This will result in a reduction in the number of Garda Divisions from the current 28 to 19 with each comprised of four Functional Areas: Community Engagement, Crime, Performance Assurance and Business Services. The Operating Model is currently being rolled out in all divisions and is fully implemented in five. </p></reply>

This is a key commitment in my Justice Plan 2022. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated family court within the existing courts structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes. </p><p>The Bill will provide a set of guiding principles to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration in all family law proceedings.The principles will give clear recognition to the need to ensure that the views of the child are heard and given due weight, and that children are appropriately informed about family law proceedings that affect them.</p><p>The drafting of the Family Court Bill is at an advanced stage with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible in this D&aacute;il session.</p><p>In addition I have also established a Family Justice Oversight Group to develop the first national strategy for the reform of the family justice system and to support the legislative changes proposed in the planned Family Court Bill. </p><p>The focus of the group is to drive and co-ordinate the modernisation of the family justice system to make it more user-friendly, streamlined, supportive and, where possible, less adversarial. During the Group&rsquo;s work to develop the strategy, it heard from children and young people who have engaged with the family justice system. They told the Group how they think a modernised family justice system should look.</p><p>Common themes were raised, similar to those raised during the wider consultation, such as the need for: a greater focus on children; better availability of and access to support services and appropriate training for those working in the family justice system, in particular for those who work with children. These areas are being considered by the Group as work to finalise the strategy continues.</p><p>The Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge, and ongoing professional training in the area of family law will be required to be appointed as a family court judge.</p></reply>

The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the group, or associated with the group, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and people being brought before the Courts. This is evident both here and in other jurisdictions, as indeed are the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles organised criminal activity through a range of targeted measures designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. To the greatest extent possible, these measures include the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.</p>  <p>  The additional resources allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years have enabled the Garda Commissioner to assign extra resources to the specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Armed Support Unit, Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses multi-disciplinary approaches to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. Such approaches include the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to CAB under the proceeds of crime legislation.</p>  <p>  Other measures taken to tackle organised crime include the strengthening of legislation where required, the establishment of a second Special Criminal Court in 2016, and the establishment of Garda Armed Response Units in all Garda regions which are available to support all divisions countrywide.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug-trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized almost &euro;64 million worth of illicit drugs and around &euro;6 million in cash. This represents a significant increase from 2019 when there were over &euro;21 million worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;2.5m in cash seized. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) conducted a search operation in Counties Donegal, Limerick and Cork on Friday 14 October 2022 targeting a Limerick based Organised Crime Group (OCG).  The operation was conducted by Bureau Officers, supported by the Southern Regional Armed Response Unit and Garda&iacute; from Donegal and Limerick. The search operation marks a significant development in the overall CAB proceeds of crime investigation which will target assets including properties linked to this OCG. In addition, the CAB were successful in a recent application to the Courts to have a property effectively owned by  a prominent OCG recognised as being the proceeds of crime.</p>  <p>  I am also progressing the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill shortly, which will increase the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.</p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2022 commits to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit. In 2022, we will also progress draft legislation to outlaw the grooming of children into a life of crime. In parallel, we will continue to roll out the community intervention programme &ldquo;Greentown&rdquo; which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang.</p></reply>

These figures excludes the subversive prisoners in Portlaoise Prison. </p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that in respect of the 17 leaders there are currently 5 further court dates pending.  </p>  <p>  In relation to  the  information sought by the Deputy in respect of the number of criminal gang leaders who have charges pending against them, it is important to state that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is responsible for the prosecution of crime in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Criminal investigations are carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who then submit a report to the DPP. It is for the DPP to decide whether or not someone should be prosecuted and for what crime, on the basis of the Garda findings, viewed against the background of common and/or statute law. The Director is fully independent in the performance of her functions.</p>  <p>  Membership or allegiance of criminal groups fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated on a daily basis. It is also the case that prisoners will not always declare their affiliation to certain groupings and it is therefore not possible to provide definitive numbers in relation to the number of known members of criminal groupings currently in custody. It should also be noted that more than one criminal gang may group together under the umbrella of a particular group and in some instances some gangs may form splinter groups due to family or in house disputes.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a number of prisons have introduced specialist programmes, including a gang desistance group which incorporates collaboration with men with a history of gang involvement in the development and facilitation of the programme. A full range of policies, procedures and standard operating procedures are used by the IPS to identify, monitor and manage specific individuals. Management and staff have to ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons. </p>  <p>  Measures taken on a continuous basis include regular targeted searching; placement in high security locations; close supervision of all visits, including the use of screened visits and the barring of certain visitors; the use of CCTV, metal detectors and mobile phone detectors; and the examination and monitoring of mail and telephone calls. The Operational Support Group has a core function to gather and collate intelligence information on criminal gang members in our prisons and to carry out intelligence led searches. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the IPS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs and the release of prisoners who form part of these groupings.</p></reply>

Both have distinct functions, powers and methods of working. </p>  <p>  Tusla has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. In doing so, it relies heavily on individuals reporting concerns about children, in accordance with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017 and the Children First Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I am assured by my Cabinet colleague - the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - that Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it. Concerns about children may arise in any setting, including within the home or involving children in the care of the State.</p>  <p>  If there are ongoing child protections concerns, Tusla will take the necessary actions to ensure that a child who may be at risk of harm is protected. If Tusla suspects that a crime has been committed and a child has been wilfully neglected or physically or sexually abused, it will formally notify the Garda&iacute; without delay.</p>  <p>  The involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in cases of alleged child abuse and neglect stems from its primary responsibility to protect the community and to bring offenders to justice. Where it is suspected that a crime has been committed, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has overall responsibility for the direction of any criminal investigation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, the investigation of suspected crimes is an operational matter within the responsibility of the Commissioner and not for me as Minister. </p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that this Government takes the issue of sexual exploitation of children very seriously and there is comprehensive legislation in place to deal with these offences.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted in early 2017. It is a wide-ranging piece of legislation, which significantly enhances laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  Specific offences have been provided for in this Act to target the recognised steps in what is often a gradual process of grooming a victim.</p>  <p>  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act are measures to strengthen significantly the existing criminal law in combating child exploitation and, in particular, to address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that sophisticated grooming often involves seemingly innocent contact with, or befriending of, a child, perhaps through text messaging, social media or messaging apps. This may be followed by the exposure of the child to sexual images or content.  Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a specific offence of using information and communications technology to communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  The offence allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to justice online predators and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.  This is in recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity so as to facilitate the production of pornography or to meet the child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that child trafficking and exploitation (including the production of child pornography) are criminalised under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 to raise the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 years from 5 to 7 years imprisonment.  Furthermore, the 2017 Act amended the 2006 Act to raise the maximum penalty for attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years from 2 to 7 years imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, as amended, also provides that the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years is life imprisonment and the same penalty applies to attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years.</p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the "Lanzarote Convention") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021.</p>  <p>  Part 2 of The Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child sexual abuse material and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.862.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000070#WRQ00700"><p>The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that offer purposeful activity to prisoners while serving their sentences and which encourage them to lead law abiding lives on release.  All prisoners are eligible to use the services, including those who are first-time offenders. The Service does not collect data on the number of first time offenders who availed on these services.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service Strategic Plan 2019 - 2022 committed to further develop the integration of prisoner care and support services to deliver more effective rehabilitation to prisoners. It committed to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management. To this end, the Irish Prison Service has changed the role of Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) Coordinator to a rostered position in all committal prisons to extend the reach of the service to evenings and weekends and increased the number of WTO-ISM Coordinator posts in Cork and Midlands Prisons. </p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management service is offered to all prisoners serving greater than 1 year and some discreet cohorts serving less than one year including candidates for the Community Support Scheme, people convicted of a sex offence, and female prisoners. </p>  <p>  In July 2021, the Irish Prison Service introduced a new central management ICT platform on the Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) to capture and monitor the work of Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators and members of the multi-disciplinary team. Since July 2021, prisoner multi-disciplinary sentence plans agreed by the prison-based team are now printed and shared with the prisoner to guide the prisoner&rsquo;s ownership of their sentence management.  This centralised information-sharing resource also assists prison-based services to improve the transition from custody to the community for offenders, with the overall aim of reducing risk to the individual and reducing risk of recidivism, while improving accountability and transparency. </p>  <p>  Between 5 July 2021 and 17 October 2022, just under 5,000 Integrated Sentence Management interviews were conducted face-to-face with prisoners to inform and direct referrals to prison based rehabilitative service providers and over 3,000 prisoner multi-disciplinary sentence plans have been agreed. </p>  <p>  Work on multi-disciplinary sentence plans is resource intensive but work is progressing in each prison to develop an individual multi-disciplinary sentence plan for all Integrated Sentence Management-eligible prisoners on a gradual basis. Once the initial plan is agreed for the prisoner the new ICT system records the need for the plan to be reviewed a minimum of once-per-year but the plan can be reviewed and updated at any time under the direction of the Governor.</p>  <p>  The prisons Work and Training service make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody. Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning and industrial skills.  </p>  <p>  The "Working to Change Social Enterprise Strategy - 2021-2023" sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and Probation Service and my Department.</p>  <p>  The Joint Irish Prison Service/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 &ndash; 2022 commits to the provision of broad based education. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Service.  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  </p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, curriculum development that is specific to prison circumstances have taken place, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts, in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  </p>  <p>  The Prison Psychology Service provide assessment and intervention and operates a proactive referral service for particular cohorts of people in custody. The Psychology Service proactively engages with the following groups of people:</p>  <p>  - 18 &ndash; 24 year olds who are committed to custody with a sentence of one year or more, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p>  <p>  - People committed to custody with a sentence of two years or more for a violent offence, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p>  <p>  - People convicted of sexual violence;</p>  <p>  - People sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The Probation Service has joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have Post Release Supervision Orders. This multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation is in place in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.865.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000070#WRQ01000"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the restricting of a person&rsquo;s liberty is a serious issue, given the Constitutional presumption that a person is deemed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</p><p>While the State&rsquo;s bail laws do provide for the refusal of bail in certain circumstances, the presiding judge is entirely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the decision to grant bail in a particular case is solely a matter for the judge.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Bail Act 1997 followed on foot of the 1996 referendum on a proposed amendment to the Constitution enabling a court to refuse bail for a person charged with a serious offence to prevent the risk of another serious offence being committed while on bail.</p><p>Over the last twenty five years, the State&rsquo;s bail laws were further strengthened, specifically by the Criminal Justice Act, 2007, the Criminal Justice Act, 2015, and the Criminal Justice Act, 2017. </p><p>In considering whether to refuse bail under the 1997 Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant and, in specific circumstances, the nature and likelihood of any danger to a person or to the community from granting bail.</p><p>The 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail. If an individual fails to comply with any bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant and this gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.</p><p>In the event of a breach of High Court bail, the defendant must be brought before the Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge and an order and/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.</p><p>In relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy, it is important to state that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is the agency responsible for the prosecution of crime in Ireland.  </p><p>Criminal investigations are carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who then submit a report to the DPP. It is for the DPP to decide whether or not someone should be prosecuted and for what crime, on the basis of the Garda findings, viewed against the background of common and/or statute law. The Director is fully independent in the performance of her functions. </p><p>Furthermore, as the Deputy may be aware, the provision of figures in relation to convictions are a matter for the Courts Service. Management of the courts, operational and logistical matters are the responsibility of the Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998 and given the separation of powers in the Constitution. As the Deputy will be aware, I have no role in this regard. </p><p>In order to be of assistance, my Department contacted the Courts Service to see if the statistics requested by the Deputy are available. I am advised by the Courts Service that statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide the specific information sought. However, it may be of interest to the Deputy to note that the Central Statistics Office regularly publishes both prison and probation re-offending statistics on their website www.cso.ie.</p></reply>

The Department of Health provides over &euro;130 million to drug and alcohol services every year. </p>  <p>  According to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System 2015-2021 Alcohol Data published in July 2022, in 2021 there was a total of 6,859 cases treated, 44% (3026) were new cases and 52% (3596) were previously treated cases. In 2021 60% (4183) of cases were treated in outpatient facilities, up by 678 cases when compared to 2020, while there was 2102 (31%) inpatient cases, up 422 from 2020. </p>  <p>In   Budget 2022 &euro;487,000 was secured to provide for a Tier 2 Clinical Community Response to Alcohol Service in CHO 9, and &euro;180,000 for a Tier 3 Alcohol Treatment service to support the NEIC Initiative.</p>  <p>  In 2020, &euro;469,600 was secured for the establishment of a Galway Community Alcohol Addiction Treatment Service to target adults with alcohol-related problems, living in the Galway City area. The service was set up to fill a gap in service provision arising from the reorganisation of alcohol services in Galway.</p>  <p>  Finally in December 2021, Minister for State for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy, Frank Feighan TD, announced a &euro;2 million fund to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services. The Community Service Enhancement Fund (CSEF) is part of the strategic priority to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community in the national drugs strategy 2021-2025.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-20a.877.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102000070#WRQ01900"><p>The Programme for Government Sharing our Future contains specific commitments in recognition of the contribution of Family Carers to care provision in Ireland, which will build on the progress to date in the implementation of the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.  One of these commitments is to review and update the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p>  <p>  Before commencing work to update and refresh the Strategy, the Department of Health will need to consider the approach to the update and the breadth of stakeholder consultation required. It is of note that a survey carried out by Care Alliance Ireland and UCC in 2021 found that for 40 of the 42 actions in the National Carers' Strategy, over 90% of carers felt they were still relevant and wanted them retained but that they should be strengthened. </p>  <p>  Government has taken a range of steps in recent years to improve the situation of carers. In line with the core vision of the 2012 Strategy, these measures recognise and respect carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence and who are empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to developing a &lsquo;Carers' Guarantee&rsquo; proposal that will provide a core basket of services to carers across the country regardless of where they live. In Budget 2021 Government provided funding of &euro;2 million to implement the Carers' Guarantee. &euro;1.9 million of this funding is being channelled through Family Carers Ireland, while the remaining &euro;100,000 is supporting the development and delivery of online supports for family carers through Care Alliance Ireland by means of an online support group.</p>  <p>  The &euro;1.9m allocation to Family Carers Ireland aims to improve access to carer supports across the country. This funding is extending services to approximately 5,000 additional family carers through a mixture of individual and community support services, including peer support, online activities, education programmes, virtual clinics and counselling supports. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to extending free GP care to carers in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. To inform the implementation of this commitment, an analysis of the policy, legal and financial implications will be undertaken by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that since September 2018, individuals in receipt of either a full or half-rate Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit are automatically eligible for a GP visit card. This means that many persons in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant already qualify for a GP visit card, as the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is paid automatically to persons in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit. Other measures introduced in recent years to expand access to GP Care include the automatic awarding of a GP visit card to all over 70s in 2015, and a 10% increase to the income thresholds for a GP Visit Card in 2019, which are considerably higher than those for a medical card. Currently, over 2 million people or 41.6% of the population have either a medical or GP visit card.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides a comprehensive package of carers&rsquo; income supports including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, in acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society and the particular challenges they face in light of the current cost of living crisis, the Minister for Social Protection announced a number of further financial supports for carers.  The measures benefitting family carers directly include a  &euro;500 Cost of Living lump sum      payment to be paid in November and a Cost of Living Double      Payment to Carers to be paid in October. Carers will also receive the      Christmas Bonus Double Payment in early December.</p>  <p>  In addition, there will be a &euro;12 increase in the maximum      rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit with effect from January      2023, with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate. The Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s      Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance      with effect from January 2023. Domiciliary Care Allowance      will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a pension solution for family carers that recognises their important work.  The current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and Home Caring Periods to recognise caring periods (of up to 20 years) outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment. On 20 September 2022, Government approved enhanced State Pension provision for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years), as recommended by the Pensions Commission, to be introduced from January 2024. This will be implemented through a scheme to ensure that long-term carers can be attributed with contributions for gaps in their contribution record arising from their time spent caring, and through the establishment of a &lsquo;Family Carer Register'. The Department of Social Protection will work to implement the reforms, including the drafting of legislation and development of administrative and IT systems as necessary.  As part of the work to implement the new scheme, relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders will examine options for the creation of a statutory &lsquo;Family Carer Register&rsquo;.</p></reply>

It will tackle the criminality and anti-social behaviour associated with the drugs trade that impose a heavy burden on communities. These issues require action across government to promote community development and community safety</p>  <p>  Drug related intimidation and violence is a serious and insidious problem that affects individuals, families, and communities, throughout the country. It is not acceptable that the lives of families and communities are blighted by the violence and intimidation associated with criminal groups. Addressing drug-related intimidation and violence is a central concern in strengthening resilience in communities, supporting participation of individuals families and communities, and developing evidence informed policies. </p>  <p>  The Drive (Drug-related intimidation and violence engagement) initiative is a data driven interagency response to tackle drug related intimidation and violence in communities most impacted. It is led by the drug and alcohol task forces, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the HSE, family support services and civil society organisations. The initiative is funded by the Department of Health for a three-year period. </p>  <p>  I launched the report on the initiative in November 2021. This is available at DRIVE: Drug Related Intimidation and Violence Engagement. An interagency response in Ireland - Drug and Alcohol Information and Support in Ireland - Drugs.ie. The report outlines the Drive model accompanied by a detailed implementation plan. As it develops, Drive will provide a toolkit for communities to enhance their capacity to address drug related intimidation. This model will complement the work of the Department of Justice on community policing and safety matters. It also builds the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme developed by An Garda Siochana and family support services to support affected families.</p>  <p>  An information session on the Drive initiative was held on 17th October. Further information on the initiative can be got by emailing drive@ndublinrdtf.ie . </p>  <p>  To support the rollout of the Drive initiative, I have allocated funding of &euro;250,000 in Budget 2023. This funding will support its work programme including the development of a suite of training and capacity building resources, a national Drive liaison network, a shared learning network and referral pathways to support for victims, awareness raising, community initiatives and targeted interagency programmes, and a national data collection system.</p></reply>

The closure of any nursing home reduces bed capacity and puts pressure on other local health and social care facilities, including acute hospitals. Ensuring the welfare and safety of residents is secured when nursing homes close is the most important thing and work to alleviate the concerns of nursing home residents must continue.</p>  <p>  All nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well-established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents.  As per regulations, HIQA must also be notified of any closure with 6 months&rsquo; notice. It is essential that when nursing homes are intending to close, residents and their families are consulted with and given appropriate notice so that new homes can be found and they can be moved in a safe, planned way. The continued wellbeing of nursing home residents and their families remains my continued focus.</p>  <p>  It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. I recognise that these cost pressures often disproportionately affect smaller nursing homes that do not have the same access to economies of scale as larger nursing homes; recent interventions by the State have taken this into consideration and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access long-term residential care is provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home</p>  <p>  - Local market prices</p>  <p>  - Historic prices</p>  <p>  - Overall budgetary capacity</p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support. The scheme will also be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating, whilst continuing to support nursing homes with the cost of managing COVID-19 outbreaks. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p></reply>

It examines the use of a variety of drugs and includes alcohol and tobacco consumption. The results of the 2019/2020 survey show that overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014/15 survey. An increase has been seen, however, in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. </p>  <p>  While cannabis is the most prevalent illegal drug used in Ireland, of cannabis use has decreased from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded. Cocaine use has increased across all age groups. Men aged 25 to 34 are most likely to report cocaine use in the last year. The findings of the 2019/20 survey represent a significant increase in use when compared to the same cohort in the 2014/15 survey.  Recent cocaine use among males aged 25-34 years increased, from 1.8% in 2003 to 9.4% in 2019-2020.</p>  <p>  Ecstasy was the second most commonly used drug in the last 12 months after cannabis and has increased in prevalence from 1.8 to 2.2%. The recent use of ecstasy among 15- to 64-year-olds has risen from 2.1% to 2.7% when compared to the findings of the 2014/15 survey. </p>  <p>  The National Drug Treatment Reporting System (NDTRS) is the national surveillance system that records and reports on the numbers of cases in treatment for drug and alcohol related problems. The latest NDTRS report published in June, provides information on treatment provided by health services to address the harmful effects of drug use, and the types of drugs that are most impacting on people in treatment, and the social factors associated with problematic drug use. </p>  <p>  The National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, sets out a health-led approach to drug use. It promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with drug use treated first and foremost as a public health issue. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government endorses this health-led approach. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue.  </p>  <p>  Arising from the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, six strategic priorities were identified for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025, which align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan. </p>  <p>  One priority is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This aims to reinforce the health-led, rather than criminal justice-led, approach to people who use of drugs and who commit drug-related crimes. The focus will be on the rollout of the health diversion programme for people in possession of drugs for personal use, which will offer compassion not punishment. Other initiatives, such as the drug treatment courts, will also be supported. A particular emphasis will be on the exchange of best practice on alternatives to coercive sanctions with EU member states.</p>  <p>  The health diversion programme will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people. The commencement of the health diversion programme is currently being finalised. The health diversion programme will be reviewed following the first full year of implementation, to ensure it is meeting all of its aims and to make any necessary changes. </p>  <p>  The working group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use examined the option of decriminalising drugs. The group did not deem this an appropriate option in the Irish context due to legal difficulties (which could lead to the de facto legalisation of drugs), and operational problems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The report of the working group is available here. Accordingly, the Government has no plans to decriminalise drugs, including cannabis.</p>  <p>  We cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by illicit drugs. The Government is committed to a public health approach to drug use, that will lead to better outcomes for individuals and society. I look forward to the deliberations on this matter by the forthcoming citizens assembly on drug use.</p></reply>

This is another record budget for mental health services, which includes the greatest increase of &euro;72.8m given in one year and demonstrates the commitment of the Government to this key care programme.  This significant investment will enable implementation of many of the short and medium-term measures in our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, enhancing the provision of mental health supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention, to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, and enabling us to continue to deliver our vital services to as many people as possible, as we move into 2023. </p>  <p>  In 2021, funding of &euro;4 million was allocated to an initiative to target a reduction in the waiting list for children and young people under the age of 18 waiting over 12 months to access primary care psychology services, further investment of approximately &euro;1.4 million in early 2022 was secured to support the ongoing initiative. This year, the Government&rsquo;s Waiting List action plan also assigned funding of &euro;5.5 million to primary care child psychology services.</p>  <p>  In 2022, the primary care psychology waiting list initiative has enabled almost 2,400 young people to access the service than otherwise would have. The initiative consists of work being implemented across the CHOs to tackle this waiting list and includes validation exercises, increased tele-screening and tele-consults, and increased provision of individual and group workshops as appropriate. Almost 2,500 young people have been removed from the primary care psychology waiting list through the work of this initiative.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also targeted the recruitment of staff psychologists, clinical psychologists, and administrative support staff, with campaigns underway across the CHOs. A national recruitment campaign to replenish the psychology assistant panel is also underway, which is expected to have a positive impact on activity and waitlist trends.</p>  <p>  Although primary care psychology is not the focus of the Enhanced Community Care Programme, the service will benefit from the new network structures, improvements in multi-disciplinary working and focus on local population needs.</p>  <p>  As occurs each year following the Budget, discussions will now take place with the HSE on details relating to specific service initiatives in the context of preparing the HSE Service Plan 2023, including that for Mental Health.</p></reply>

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. In the interim the HSE puts in place a locum or other appropriate arrangement to maintain GP services to the communities in question.</p>  <p>  As of the 1st of October, there are 2,529 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme. There were 25 GMS GP vacancies, approximately 1 percent of the total number of GMS panels. It is acknowledged that certain vacancies can be difficult to fill, often in rural areas. For this reason, in addition to the more general measures taken to increase the number of GPs in the State and the significant increases in investment into general practice, specific supports are in place to support GPs in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was introduced previously to support rural GPs, these supports have been increased by 10% under the 2019 GP Agreement. In addition, practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking. Specific fees are also in place for dispensing doctors (who operate in rural areas), these have been increased by 28% under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. Following, the transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are preparing to commence shortly a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice in general and in rural areas specifically, and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a sustainable general practice.</p></reply>

Typically each employer has a single ERN, however due to its scale and historic make-up, the HSE has a number of Employer Registration Numbers. This can result in the application of emergency tax after a rotation.</p>  <p>I have written to the HSE asking that this issue be resolved through the establishment of a single payroll system.

It is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE. The Board ensures that Sl&aacute;intecare implementation is fully embedded and owned across the Department of Health and the HSE. The Board engages with the Joint Committee on Health on a regular basis. </p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy 2021-2023, and the 2022 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan are focused on two reform programmes: </p><p><i>1. Improving Safe, Timely Access to Care and Promoting Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing, and </i></p><p><i>2. Addressing Health Inequalities &mdash; towards Universal Healthcare</i></p><p>Despite the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19 and a major cyber-attack, learnings were made and significant Sl&aacute;intecare reform and innovation is being delivered across our health and social services. Innovations and reforms have been made across a wide number of areas including community care, integrating care pathways, eHealth, increasing capacity, strategic organisation, healthy living, including:</p><p>- We recruited over 2,158 staff to the Enhanced Community Care Programme, and we established 18 of the 19 Community Care Local Development Officers. The Home Support Pilot integrates GPs with community teams in 4 Community Health Care Networks. We established 90 of the planned 96 CHNs. Services to Older Persons and those with Chronic Disease are now provided by 33 new Community Specialist Teams. Timely community or home care is provided by 21 new Community Intervention Teams, reducing hospital admissions, and waiting lists. </p><p>- Opening new Primary Care Centres (PCCs) brought their total number to 152. The GP Chronic Disease Management (CDM) Programme and the GP Access to Diagnostics programmes are ongoing. The Opportunistic Case Finding (OCF) and Prevention Pilot Programmes are using a Population Segmentation approach to apply bespoke interventions for those at risk, reducing ED attendance and waiting lists. Funding of &euro;350m for 45 actions will further reduce waiting lists and initiate long-term reforms in acute care. </p><p>- Preliminary Business Cases were completed for new elective centres in Cork and Galway are at the final stage of review and a Memorandum for Government expected to be presented for consideration in the very near future. </p><p>- Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Funding (SIF) of &euro;28 million delivered 106 successful HSE and NGO projects that have been either mainstreamed or scaled by the HSE. Appraisal of applications for a second round of funding is underway with decisions on successful applicants due in the near future. </p><p>- Progress on strategic change is shown by strong support for the implementation of the six Regional Health Areas. The RHA Implementation Team is comprised of senior members of the HSE, DoH, and DCEDIY staff working across six different workstreams along with colleagues from the Hospital Groups and CHOs for the RHA design and implementation phase. To note, the RHAs will serve one population in one region with one budget as formal regional divisions of the HSE, and as such, RHAs will report to the HSE Board. This policy direction balances the need for national consistency with regional autonomy and associated accountability. This will ensure national policies can be implemented consistently and disruption to the system will be minimised as we make this transition. This is in line with core Sl&aacute;intecare. </p><p>Detailed progress on implementing Sl&aacute;intecare to date is contained in the published progress reports and are available on the Government website (please see link: gov.ie - Sl&aacute;intecare: Publications (www.gov.ie)). Voices of patients recorded in the Sl&aacute;intecare 2021 end-of-year report, demonstrate how Sl&aacute;intecare is improving people&rsquo;s lives. They illustrate the outstanding work being done throughout the health system to adapt, to innovate and to move towards the provision of integrated services that put patients first. </p><p>The government remains strongly committed to implementing the health reform and will continue to focus on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></reply>

Undergraduate nursing and midwifery education programmes require students to undertake mandatory practice placements as a key requirement for the attainment of clinical competencies. These mandatory practice placements account for over 50% of the entire four-year undergraduate programme. Placement sites are chosen by the undergraduate programme provider to best support the student to acquire specific clinical competencies. The variances in the distance students are required to travel depends on the undergraduate programme the student is undertaking, the location of that programme and the availability of placements.</p><p>Practice placements for student nurses and midwives account for 81 weeks of the entire four-year undergraduate programme and students have a minimum of 4 hours protected time for reflection each week throughout the undergraduate programme. However, 36 weeks (internship) of these occur during the fourth year. The salary for student nurses and midwives on their final-year internship placement has increased and now stands at &euro;23,416 (annualised) for general nursing and midwifery students and &euro;23,911 (annualised) for psychiatric nursing students. The salary is reflective of the increased level of responsibility for care delivery that the internship period facilitates while remaining part of the students clinical learning requirement.  </p><p>The remaining 45 weeks of mandatory supernumerary practice placements occur from year 1 of the programme right through to the first semester of year four. Student nurses and midwives are entitled to claim a reimbursement of necessarily incurred travel expenses while attending practice placements. The Deputy will be aware that, aside from being able to recoup travel cost incurred while attending practice placements, the Transport For Ireland (TFI) 90 Minute Fare has reduced to &euro;1.00 for young adults (19-23) and students. This is a substantial reduction which benefits all students, including student nurses and midwives as they travel between home, college, and elsewhere.  Some students require overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements. The current overnight accommodation allowance for students is capped at &euro;100 per week, up from &euro;50.79 per week which was the amount from 2004 until September 2021 (receipts are required).</p><p>On 4 November 2021, following the publication of Longer-Term Review of Matters relating to Student Nurses and Midwives, an independent review, conducted by Mr. Se&aacute;n McHugh at my request (McHugh Report), I announced that the Government had approved my proposal to provide significant additional supports, worth &euro;12m, for student nurses and midwives while attending their clinical placements.  Among these temporary measures, I extended the Pandemic Placement Grant (PPG) of &euro;100 per week to all eligible nursing and midwifery students on supernumerary placement to the end of the academic year 2021/22.</p><p>I also announced additional support to nursing and midwifery students who require overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements. I doubled the cap on the vouched accommodation allowance to &euro;100 per week of placement. Student nurses and midwives (for Academic Year 2021/22) on paid internship placement received additional financial support (50% of the PPG: totalling to &euro;1,800 for the academic year) for the duration of their internship, from 1 January 2022. </p><p>These additional supports arose following the publication of the McHugh report which set out a number of recommendations, including an enhanced Travel and Subsistence scheme for students while attending their supernumerary clinical placements. As this is a significant departure from the current position, I have committed to bringing a further proposal to Government setting out how to deal with this recommendation with effect from the start of the 2022/2023 academic year. Along with my Department I have considered a number of options in relation to this recommendation so that an enhanced scheme can shortly be put in place that will provide a targeted and more equitable approach to supporting students in undertaking their supernumerary clinical placements.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. </p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>For 2023, funding of &euro;443 million is being allocated to tackle Waiting Lists.

Using a habitats-based approach, delivered through both multi-functional prescription and results-based actions, ACRES aims to contribute significantly to achieving improved biodiversity, climate, air and water quality outcomes.</p><p>The Scheme has two approaches:</p><p>-  ACRES Co-operation Project (CP), which applies in eight mapped zones that are areas of high nature value, hold significant carbon stores and are home to some of the most pristine waters in the country. Farmers participating in this approach will have the assistance of a local Co-operation Project (CP) Team, who will assist with implementation of the  scheme at local level.</p><p>-  ACRES General, for all other farmers not falling within CP Zones.</p><p>Based on learnings from other results-based schemes trialled by the Department and experience in GLAS, the average annual payment is estimated to be approximately &euro;7,000 for farmers in the ACRES CP measure and &euro;5,000 for farmers in the ACRES General measure.</p></reply>

While over 43,500 GLAS contracts remain active, all will expire on 31 December 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed &euro;1.5bn to ACRES over its duration, which is the largest amount ever committed to an agri-environment scheme. The budget allocation will facilitate the participation of 50,000 participants in ACRES overall. Farmers may apply for one of the approaches available under ACRES, namely the ACRES General approach or the ACRES Co-operation approach depending on the location of their holding.  </p>  <p>  It is currently envisaged that the split will be 30,000 participants in ACRES General and 20,000 participants in ACRES Co-operation &ndash; this will, however, be ultimately subject to the level of interest in each approach. The intake into the scheme will be phased, with at least two tranches, to spread the workload on advisors and enable them to allocate sufficient time for the preparation of applications, and the completion of the Farm Sustainability Plan (FSP) and selection of appropriate actions.</p></reply>

An additional quota extension of 425 meat processing operative permits was also established in June 2022. DETE has advised that they continue to keep the employment permits system under review in light of changing labour market circumstances and the timing of future quota allocations will be kept under consideration.</p>  <p>  While this is one method for helping to fill labour shortages, it should be considered as a last resort. The Department of Social Protection are involved in helping employers recruit from the domestic and European labour market. Sectors also need to have appropriate labour attraction and retention policies in place.</p>  <p>  The new Food Vision 2030 strategy includes a goal to &ldquo;Attract and Nurture Diverse and Inclusive Talent&rdquo; and this recommends actions for the sector, including that employers in the agri-food industry will develop an education, skills and talent attraction and retention strategy.

This draft Forest Strategy will be subject to a period of public consultation, which is due to commence this week.  </p>  <p>  DAFM is also currently developing a new Forest Strategy Implementation Plan which will include the next Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027.  There has been engagement with stakeholders and the public on the next Forestry Programme, which has gone to public consultation through the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment process this week.</p>  <p>  Having secured an additional &euro;12 million in Budget 2023 for Forestry to reach a total budget of &euro;112m, DAFM is also currently engaged in detailed discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to agree new grant and premium rates for the next Programme in order to incentivise the necessary levels of planting for Ireland to meet its afforestation targets. </p>  <p>  When concluded DAFM aims to provide this information regarding grants and premium rates at the earliest opportunity, as part of the process to secure state aid approval from the European Commission.</p></reply>

To date, 191 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;279 million for projects costing &euro;379 million.</p>  <p>  Calls for applications to the Fund are sought under two categories &ndash; Category 1 and Category 2. Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed. Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for Category 1 applications.</p>  <p>The fourth call for Category 1 applications to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed on 29 April 2022.  My Department received 42 applications to this call, together seeking funding of over &euro;149 million. I understand that an application was received for the project referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The application process for the Fund is competitive in nature. Applications are currently being assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department prepares a report setting out recommended projects. My role as Minister is to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding.  </p>  <p>  I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding. From 2017 to 2021, improvement works have been completed on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas. This year alone I have committed &euro;22 million under the scheme. Investment in LIS roads has now exceeded &euro;100 million since the establishment of my Department.</p>  <p>  Eligible road projects under the scheme are determined by the relevant local authorities in accordance with a broad outline set down by my Department. The road must provide access to parcels of land of which two or more are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate agricultural activities.   </p>  <p>  In order to satisfy the requirement for agricultural activity, applicants should provide documentation to their local authority to verify that they are engaged in such agricultural activities on the parcel of land in question. This can be done by providing evidence such as a herd/flock number or a copy of the maps associated with the applicant's Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Basic Payment Scheme application, or equivalent documentation.</p></reply>
