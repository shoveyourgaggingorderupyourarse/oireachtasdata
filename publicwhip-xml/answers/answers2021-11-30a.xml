It will produce a comprehensive report on the Shared Island in Q1 2022. </p><p>This research is part of a comprehensive research programme on Shared Island matters, involving the NESC, as well as the ESRI, the Irish Research Council and other partners. </p><p>2. <b>Climate and Biodiversity</b>: NESC is providing advice in relation to <i>just transition,</i>including case studies and work on developing indicators. It is also beginning a significant piece of research and consultation on climate, biodiversity and transition in agriculture.</p><p>3. <b>Housing</b>: NESC research has helped build consensus on the need for change in our housing system. In 2022, it will further consider practical aspects of a more pro-active land management system. It will also continue to examine housing systems that achieve affordability, inclusion and sustainability, drawing on aspects of the Irish system, including initial cost rental projects, and international experience.  </p><p>4. <b>Ireland&rsquo;s Well-Being Framework</b>: In 2021, NESC carried out a consultation with a range of stakeholders and experts.  In the coming year its work will examine the implementation of well-being frameworks, looking at international work and drawing on selected Irish work in such areas as performance and equality budgeting, and sectoral approaches in certain areas such as children&rsquo;s well-being. It will also look at how specific groups within society experience inequality.</p><p>5. <b>Recovery and Resilience</b>: This work will examine aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic to help identify strategic lessons about public governance and how government can be supported to arrange and manage its activity to deliver the best results for society. </p><p>The Council has so far published five reports in 2021:</p> <blockquote> 	&middot;<i>Grounding the Recovery in Sustainable Development: A Statement from the Council </i>(NESC Report No. 152)<br /><br />&middot;<i>Shared Island:  Projects, Progress &amp;amp; Policy Scoping Paper</i>(NESC Report No. 153)<br /><br />&middot;<i>Digital Inclusion in Ireland: Connectivity, Devices &amp;amp; Skills </i>(NESC Report No. 154)<br /><br />&middot;<i>Ireland&rsquo;s Well-Being Framework: Consultation Report </i>(NESC Report No. 155)<br /><br />&middot;<i>Collaboration on Climate and Biodiversity: Shared Island as a Catalyst for Renewed Ambition &amp;amp; Action</i>(NESC Report No.156) </blockquote>  <p>As reports are finalised in the relevant areas they are brought to Government for approval in advance of publication.</p></reply>

In fact my Department will spend over &euro;400 million on student supports in 2021 including the Student Grant scheme which assists over 74,000 students annually to access third level education.</p>  <p>  I am deeply aware of the strain that the rising cost of living and the continuing pandemic has placed on our students. I have prioritised addressing the concerns of students in the budgetary and policy decisions which I have taken.  In doing so, I decided to concentrate on the most impactful measures which will benefit the greatest numbers of people and those most in need of support.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 I made the first changes to SUSI grant rates and eligibility thresholds in a decade. An additional &euro;200 in the rate will benefit all students in receipt of a SUSI maintenance payment. The change in the thresholds of &euro;1,000 and adjacency rates will widen eligibility and provide higher rates of grant to many already in the scheme.  As a full year cost this package of funding will provide an additional &euro;60m for SUSI supports.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular impacts on students in financial difficulty, I have also directed additional &euro;22m in Covid specific funding to students through the Student Assistance Fund and priority groups in the new National Access Plan. Significant additional support has also been provided for student mental health (&euro;8m over two years). </p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I will shortly be bringing the Report on Future Sustainability of further and higher education including an assessment of the future funding model for higher education to Government. This report also identifies the need for additional student supports which is being further investigated through the SUSI Review, currently being finalised.  This review is examining the eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports for students and the first step in addressing these.  The review included extensive consultations with all key stakeholders including USI and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The findings will inform policy priorities and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.</p>  <p>  Finally, a word on student accommodation which I know can be a significant cost for students. We are addressing affordability issues through measures such as:</p>  <p>  - Capping student Accommodation under the Rent Pressure Zones.</p>  <p>  - For tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 restricts the total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent. </p>  <p>  - Limiting termination notice periods in respect of student-specific accommodation, so that no more than 28 days&rsquo; notice is required to be given by students.</p>  <p>  I am working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to consider how new models for affordable purpose-built student accommodation could be developed. Affordability will be a key priority. </p></reply>

These changes will take effect in the next academic year.  </p><p>These changes have allowed me to make early progress in addressing what I expect will be some of the themes emerging from the Review of the Student Grant Scheme.  This includes ensuring that the scheme keeps paces with changes in the economy, people&rsquo;s level of earnings and changes in the cost of living. </p><p>The package which I announced includes an increase of &euro;1,000 in the income thresholds for the standard rate of maintenance grant. </p><p>The scheme is demand led and it is not possible to give exact statistics of how many new students may apply or be eligible by changing the thresholds.  However, I expect it may lead to an increase in the number of students in the scheme of between 1,000 and 1,500 people.  </p><p>It is also anticipated that this change will have a positive impact on a number of students currently within the grant scheme.  Using assessment of last year&rsquo;s figures as a basis, I would imagine on the order of 6,800 students might benefit from the change in thresholds.</p><p>Alongside the &euro;200 increase in the rate of grant, which will benefit all students, and the changes in the non-adjacent rate, these represent significant enhancements to our support for students who rely on SUSI.</p></reply>

A dedicated apprentice guidance line has been established to support this initial period of increased visibility of apprenticeship to school leavers.</p><p>- Extending the female craft apprentice employer bursary to all apprenticeship programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. The bursary will be established from January 2022 and details of this scheme will be released in the near future. </p><p>- Progress on labelling access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses and increased clarity on progress routes is expected to be delivered in the near future. </p><p>The increase in apprenticeship registrations in 2021, exceeding expectations of a recovery from Covid-19 impacted 2020 but also showing a 25% increase on 2019 figures for the same period demonstrates the attractiveness of apprenticeships.  The recent inclusion of apprenticeship information on the CAO website will further help to increase awareness of and access to apprenticeship for a new cohort of learners. </p><p>I am satisfied that the suite of initiatives included in the Apprenticeship Action Plan will provide strong momentum to boosting the presence of currently under-represented groups in our apprenticeship population.  </p></reply>

The North West Strategic Growth Partnership is an example of this, where Donegal ETB and the North West Regional College in Northern Ireland ensure their programme complement, rather than compete with each other to ensure the FET needs of that region are addressed.  </p>  <p>  I also welcome the range of other activity in this area, including the important work which Aontas, the adult learning organisation, have been doing to support collaboration among community education practitioners in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I believe there is more potential for strengthened collaboration in FET, and the forthcoming PEACE PLUS programme will be provide a tremendous platform to develop such engagement.    </p>  <p>  This new programme will look to support area-based approaches, designed to address skills gaps, which will result in increased productivity and employment and higher levels of cross-border labour mobility.  </p>  <p>  The types of actions which would be in scope for funding on a cross-border basis include the provision of skills programmes in critical areas such as ICT, digital, green economy and entrepreneurship and delivery of programmes to support people in re-engaging with employment and upskilling.  This is an area in which intensified co-operation on a cross-border basis in FET can make a major contribution to the achievement of shared objectives under PEACE PLUS.</p>  <p>  The draft PEACE PLUS programme has been approved by the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive through the North-South Ministerial Council, and the Special EU Programmes Body is currently finalising its submission to the EU Commission for approval. It is likely that this stage will conclude in the first half of next year, with calls for proposals to be issued later in 2022.  I will keep the House updated on developments.</p></reply>

It was introduced in March 2020 and has supported a significant recovery of apprentice registrations in throughout the COVID-19 period, enabling registrations so far this year to exceed registrations for 2019.  </p><p>There have been 6,471 registrations so far in 2021 &ndash; an increase which not only exceeds expectations of a recovery of 2020 registrations which were badly impacted COVID-19, but also shows a 25% increase on 2019 figures for the same period.</p><p>Up to the end of October 2021, almost &euro;12m has been approved under the Scheme in respect of 5,971 apprentice registrations, with over 3,000 unique employers availing of it.

This will continue for the 25 programmes currently covered under this process.</p><p>Under the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025</i>, employers of all other apprentices will become eligible for an annual grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice. The implementation details are being worked through with a view to ensuring that the scheme is effective and introduced on a timely basis. </p><p>This will be supplemented by further practical measures to support the employment of apprentices in SMEs, and measures to support the employment of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship and the delivery of skills essential to the economy. Initial activity in this area will be delivered through the extension of the existing bursary for employers of female craft apprentices to all apprenticeships with over 80% representation of a single gender.</p><p>The employer grant along with these other initiatives have the potential to play a very important role in securing engagement with employers in addressing barriers to participation in the apprenticeship system.</p></reply>

This Fund supports educationally disadvantaged learners in accessing and participating in further education and training. It also enables investment in building the digital infrastructure of FET providers and their online learning capability.

In that context, a fully inclusive FET system is a priority for me in my role as Minister for State and for the Department. Inclusion is one of my Department's six strategic goals in its Statement of Strategy, and a core pillar of FET Strategy: Transforming Learning. </p><p>The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including persons with a disability.</p><p>In 2017, SOLAS published <i>&lsquo;Barriers to Further Education and Training with Particular Reference to Long Term Unemployed Persons and Other Vulnerable Individuals&rsquo;, </i>and the implementation of this report is a condition of funding through the strategic funding arrangements between SOLAS and the 16 Education and Training Boards. In line with the Programme for Government commitment, it is planned that in 2022, SOLAS will commission further research to examine barriers to participation in FET, with particular reference to persons with a disability.</p><p>I can also assure the Deputy that there is ongoing engagement and monitoring in relation to provision and support within FET, including for persons with a disability, through the Strategic Performance Agreement process between SOLAS and the 16 Education and Training Boards. </p><p>In alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the FET sector is implementing Universal Design for Learning, and published <i>'UDL for FET Practitioners: Guidance for Implementing UDL in Irish Further Education and Training'</i>guidelines earlier this year.</p><p>SOLAS are also currently overseeing an independent evaluation of Specialist Training Provision programme, which provides training for persons with a disability with higher support needs, to examine the quality, effectiveness, on-going relevance and overall value of training that is currently delivered by specialist training providers, and to propose any recommendations for future practice.</p><p>All of the foregoing initiatives and the broader operation of the FET system, including engagement with relevant stakeholders, provide SOLAS and the ETB system with very good insights and understanding on the access requirements of learners with disabilities which will help guide and inform future planning and delivery in this priority area.  </p><p>I have also secured additional funding of &euro;5m as part of Budget 2022 for the National Access and Inclusion Plan including a dedicated pilot <i>Pathways project</i>in higher education for students with intellectual disabilities.

This objective will inform analysis regarding the appropriate duration for the completion of any apprenticeship training.    </p>  <p>  Apprenticeships currently range from two to five years leading to qualifications at levels 5-10 of the national framework of qualifications.  It is important to highlight that as part of the apprenticeship development process the duration and level of the programme is linked to the achievement of specific learning outcomes, aligned with the skills and competencies an apprentice must demonstrate in order to qualify from their apprenticeship.  These factors are set out in an occupational profile which is approved by the Apprenticeship Council on the basis of the alignment of the apprenticeship with skills needs. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out a new structure for the management and governance of apprenticeship and provides for a shift to a single apprenticeship model which will deliver more discretion in relation to innovation and reform of programme content.    </p>  <p>  Setting the coordination and delivery of all apprenticeships close to the employer-education sector interface, through the use of apprenticeship consortia, will promote a timely and effective response to changing sectoral needs. </p>  <p>Proposed changes to the duration, level or other elements within the approved occupational profile will be examined by the proposed National Apprenticeship Alliance, which will take on the approval role from the Apprenticeship Council.

It is firmly focused on responding in an agile and flexible way to priority skill needs, and to changes in the world of work driven by technology, to ensure Ireland has a skilled and productive workforce. </p>  <p>  The National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora operating under the National Skills Strategy, foster engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, the enterprise agencies, and private sector representatives in relation to skills priorities. </p>  <p>  The skills ecosystem also encompasses the labour market information entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  This skills infrastructure informs and drives responsive and flexible forecasting, planning, and provision to meet skills requirements across all sectors of the economy.  It has an important role to play in identifying skills provision shortfalls to be addressed by the education and training system and concerns relating to labour shortages in particular sectors that relate to other factors.      </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Economic Recovery Plan, I recently launched a Skills Strategy Project to be undertaken in partnership with the OECD, which will play an important role in ensuring that Ireland's skills system is effective in meeting skills and human capital needs.  This will be central to our economic and social sustainability against the backdrop of major trends impacting on the workforce and society including digitisation and climate transition. </p></reply>

NZEB skills training comprising one to four days of training is largely targeted to existing construction professionals.  Ongoing innovation in delivery includes a move to a blended model of training in addition to the development of a pilot VR programme which is expected to be operational by year end.  </p>  <p>  For new entrants at craft level, curricula in apprenticeships are updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations. At non-craft operative level LOETB has developed, as a key component of its Just Transition response to Bord Na Mona employees, a six-day Skills to Advance programme that offers the trainee an opportunity to gain QQI Level V Certification in Thermal Insulation Installation. LOETB is also developing a follow-on programme based around QQI Level 5 modules in Ventilation and Air Tightness to be offered to all participants of the Thermal Insulation Programme.</p>  <p>  There is no specific apprenticeship in retrofit at the current time.  Rather, retrofit activity covers a range of tasks and professions including craft trades and operative level occupations in the construction sector.  Should there be a need for a retrofit-specific apprenticeship to complement the existing range of offerings, the development of new apprenticeships is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers can come together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship response in their sector under a defined process.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Budget 2022 skills package of &euro;132m, including &euro;22m towards the Further Education Green Skills Action Programme, the range of actions envisaged under the Apprenticeship Action Plan and the wider skills response across the tertiary education system will help ensure that priority skill needs in our economy in the years ahead will be met for the midlands and for Ireland.   </p></reply>

We will need to maximise our ability to produce talented and responsible graduates who can lead, innovate, create, inspire, and transform. We will need these graduates in every village, town, city, and region in Ireland if we are to achieve the ground-up community engagement required to succeed in a sustainable manner. The development of Technological Universities is a key development in this context and will prove to be transformative economically for our regions.</p><p>We are seeing strong early success with our TUs. In MTU the demand from CAO applicants has surged, with first-preference honours degree applications for MTU courses rising by more than 16%, almost twice the national average. In addition, the KTI Annual Knowledge Transfer Survey 2020 indicated that total research expenditure in MTU exceeded &euro;22M. </p><p>As the largest provider of part-time education in the state, TU Dublin makes an important contribution to the socio-economic life of the capital, TU Dublin&rsquo;s  award-winning technology transfer and business incubation activity has  delivered over 400 new sustainable businesses with an economic value of almost &euro;700 million.</p><p>Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, recently established in October, is a multi-campus university spread across six campuses throughout Ireland&rsquo;s Midwest and Midlands region with more than 14,000 students enrolled in hundreds of courses across four counties. </p><p>In addition to the established TUs, on 28 October, I announced that I was granting TU designation to the CUA consortium of GMIT, IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT. The name agreed by the applicant institutes for the new Technological University for the West and North West region being established next year shall be the Atlantic Technological University (Ollscoil Teicheola&iacute;ochta an Atlantaigh) with 1 April 2022 envisaged as the date of establishment. This TU will be unique in its geographic situation in the West / North West which will enable it to further foster and deepen significant cross-border higher education and economic linkages.</p><p>On 2 November I announced that a TU in the South East is to be established next year, subject to finalisation of some remaining technical and operational matters. The HEA will play a key assessment role in this regard, reporting on final compliance. All parties are working toward the new university opening its doors by 1 May 2022.</p><p>These new TUs are increasing higher education access, boosting regional development, and increasing opportunities for students, staff, businesses, and local communities. TUs are now taking their rightful place in the higher education landscape, benefiting students right across the regions, and proving that higher education can deliver regional excellence, while also making the international ambitions of student, staff and communities a reality.</p><p>TUs play a leadership role in the strategic development of our regions, and, in so doing, will adopt a global outlook and a civic-centric value system. TUs anchor regional development while participating fully on both the national, and international, stages.</p><p>In September the HEA announced funding of<b></b>&euro;25.7million to relevant higher education institutions in support of either progression towards TU status or for the vital post-establishment development phase. This brings total funding under the Technological University Transformation Fund to &euro;60 million with a further &euro;30m still to be awarded next year to assist the development and progression of TUs.</p><p>In addition, &euro;40 million is being allocated to a TU education and reforms project under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and my Department is also preparing a further TU oriented application under the European Regional Development Fund. </p><p>The 2 remaining standalone Institutes of Technology, Dundalk and Dun Laoghaire, that are not currently part of a TU development consortium, are striving to attain future TU status with the assistance of the HEA and material Transformation Fund support. It remains a matter for the governing bodies of autonomous Institutes of Technology as decide where they locate themselves on the higher education landscape.</p></reply>

The scheme has seen some of Ireland&rsquo;s most prominent researchers &lsquo;shadowing&rsquo; members of the Oireachtas for the day in Leinster House. The scheme was developed by the Irish Research Council to bridge the divide between policy-making and research and to ensure that elected representatives are supported to tap into publicly funded research. </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Shadowing Scheme pairs an Irish Research Council-funded researcher with a member of the Oireachtas. Typically, the researcher will be matched with a TD or Senator from his or her local constituency or who has expertise in an area of interest. The researcher accompanies the TD or Senator to Leinster House on the agreed date, observes proceedings and shadows their work for the day. The scheme is an excellent opportunity for researchers to deepen their understanding of political engagement and the policy-making system &ndash; and for members of the Oireachtas to engage directly with publicly-funded researchers. Members are welcome to do a return visit to the researcher&rsquo;s institution, if they wish.  </p>  <p>  It is the intention of the Irish Research Council to revisit its Oireachtas Shadowing Scheme once restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are fully lifted. The next pairings will expand to include Irish members of the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The SFI Public Service Fellowship, which was launched in 2019, is a pilot initiative which offers researchers a unique opportunity to be temporarily seconded to Government departments, agencies and the Library and Research Service of the Oireachtas, to work on specific projects where they can add value, resulting in mutually beneficial outcomes. The Fellowships awarded will foster innovation within the Public Sector by supporting the development and implementation of data-driven and evidence-based approaches.</p>  <p>  A total of 12 Public Service Fellowships were awarded with placements in a number of hosts: Houses of the Oireachtas Library and Research Services (6 Fellows), the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration (1 Fellow), Food Safety Authority of Ireland (2 Fellows), The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (2 Fellows) and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (1 Fellow). Of the 12 Fellowships 7 are due to end their placement in 2021. The remaining Fellows will carry out their placements until 2023.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the academic research community can provide essential input, expertise and service to bolster the work of colleagues in Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  Equally, placements within Government Departments and agencies will expose academic researchers to the mechanics of public service and policy making which will contribute greatly to their career development. The secondment model will also provide an opportunity for further dissemination of knowledge and learnings to a broader academic cohort on return of the Fellow to their academic institution. Thus, the SFI Public Service Fellowship pilot programme will help in increasing the linkages between the research and civil service systems.</p>  <p>  There is also Creating our Future, our national conversation on the role research can and should play in addressing opportunities, challenges and hopes for the future. I am grateful to Deputy Naughten for working with the Creating our Future team as Chair of the informal, cross party group on science and technology giving Members of the Oireachtas, and their staff the opportunity to learn more about the campaign and encourage engagement in their communities.  As we approach the end of the campaign I am pleased to see that there have been over ten thousand submissions so far, and I look forward to seeing the final tally.</p>  <p>  In addition, I recently announced plans to decouple the Chief Science Adviser role from the role of the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland in the medium term. In August, my department initiated informal discussions with stakeholders on science advisory structures. My Department will present a formal consultation document and commence a public consultation on the role of science advice structures to identify the best model for Ireland.

In this context, expressions of interest are being sought by my Department in a public process launched last week for key posts on the TU&rsquo;s first governing body including that of chairperson. An open public process has also been launched by the applicant institutes seeking expressions of interest in the post of first president of the new TU.</p>  <p>  On 23 November, I announced that the name agreed by the applicant institutes for the new Technological University for the West and North West region being established next year shall be the Atlantic Technological University (Ollscoil Teicheola&iacute;ochta an Atlantaigh). The name was chosen by the applicant institutes following a comprehensive survey commissioned by them of relevant internal and external stakeholders including most notably the students and staff of the three Institutes. This name has the full support of all three governing bodies.</p>  <p>  Subject to the drafting of the requisite Ministerial order under the Technological Universities Act 2018 by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, its laying before and approval by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas, it is proposed that the date on which the three Institutes will be formally dissolved and the Atlantic Technological University established in their place shall be the 1 April 2022. This means that students of the current three Institutes who graduate in this academic year of 2021/2022 and henceforth in the West and North West will do so with university qualifications.</p>  <p>  On foot of the TURN report Government announced in Budget 2020 the provision of &euro;90 million over the next three years under a TU Transformation Fund to support Institutes of Technology to jointly achieve TU designation and to further the advancement of established TUs. This dedicated funding is additional to the &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding invested in TU development and progression since 2013. My department has secured a further &euro;40 million in TU oriented funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. My department and the Higher Education Authority are also working to secure additional TU research funding under the European Regional Development Fund from next year. </p>  <p>  To date the consortium of GMIT, IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT has received almost &euro;16 million to advance its TU proposals. The HEA meets regularly with the fund recipients and consults at a sectoral level via the TU Research Network (TURN), to oversee the use of the fund and to best serve the needs of each institution or consortia at its current stage in the TU trajectory.</p>  <p>Considerable progress has been made towards the objectives of the fund since initial disbursements were made in 2020, as evidenced by the robust monitoring systems put in place to track progress. The last round of funding allocations was determined on the basis of assessed capacity and progress evidenced in meeting the objectives and ambitions outlined in the TURN Report. In this context, the HEA will issue a funding call in 2022 to each institution or consortia.  </p></reply>

This report sets out the demand for skilled workers required to support the growth of renewable energy generation over the coming 10 year period.  Engineers, Electrical and electronics technicians, ecology and environmental experts among others will be required to support the development of this vital element of Ireland's move to a Zero Carbon Economy. </p>  <p>  The national skills infrastructure provides a robust framework to support industry to meet skills needs.  While a structured response to the specific skills identified in the newly published report will be delivered over the coming period, the education and training sector is already working collaboratively with the wind industry to deliver on required skills needs across both further and higher education institutions.  </p>  <p>  Under Budget 2022, a total investment of &euro;78 million for reskilling and upskilling was provided including a &euro;22 million Green Skills Action programme and continued investment in supporting businesses.  Ireland&rsquo;s recent Recovery and Resilience Plan included SOLAS&rsquo;s Recovery Skills Response Programme will see a range of additional educational and training programmes rolled out as part of the Skills to Compete and the establishment of the SOLAS Green Skills Action programme focusing on providing training to address climate and low carbon economy issues. This approach will span all of Ireland, including the South East. </p>  <p>  There are a number of Wind Energy Schemes currently established nationwide. Kerry Education and Training Board offer a full suite of training schemes such as the Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician traineeship which was established in 2014. This traineeship typically lasts 39 weeks and includes a minimum of 30 percent on-the-job training. Upon completion, trainees may receive a City and Guilds Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrical Power Engineering, with high placement rates for graduate trainees.</p>  <p>  Kerry ETB has also developed the Wind Turbine Maintenance apprenticeship programme which was submitted to Quality and Qualifications Ireland in June of this year for validation at level 6 NFQ. The apprenticeship is expected to commence in Q1, 2022, subject to completion of validation.  </p>  <p>  The Green Tech Skillnet also provides training opportunities in wind energy both for those working in the industry and for people looking to enter the wind industry.  The Green Tech Skillnet is an enterprise-led network facilitating the workforce and development needs of the Irish renewable energy industry.  Green Tech Skillnet is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future.  In 2020, Green Tech Skillnet supported over 180 companies and provided upskilling to over 600 employed trainees through 1,700 training days in courses that include &ndash; </p>  <p>  - Introduction to Wind</p>  <p>  - Advanced Composite Wind Turbine Blade Repair</p>  <p>  - The Clean Energy Package Review and Risk Assessment and, </p>  <p>  - Wind Turbine Technician. </p>  <p>  Green Tech Skillnet also delivers programmes through the Skills Connect initiative to support jobseekers seeking to enter the renewable sector which includes a wind turbine technician programme. </p>  <p>  At higher education level, 14 courses in renewable energy have been established under Springboard+ 2021. Under HCI Pillar 1, there are 5 courses in or related to renewable energy and 2 under HCI Pillar 2. HCI Pillar 3, Innovation and Agility has two key areas of focus &ndash; innovation in modes and methods of delivery and an agility fund. There are 17 projects in or related to renewable energy within this stream, aiming to ensure that courses in areas of skills needs demonstrate innovative methods of teaching and delivery.</p>  <p>  The expansion of education and training delivery to support the skills required to support the growth of the offshore wind energy sector will be determined in a structured manner under the skills infrastructure mechanism.</p></reply>

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.</p>  <p>  The report referred to in the Deputy's question,  a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education (2016), was commissioned under the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme in November 2019. The final report deliverable was agreed between the Commission (DG Reform) and it's consultants at the end of May 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced its examination of the report's analysis, findings, conclusions and recommendations in order to develop proposals to present to Government to seek it&rsquo;s support to a sustainable future funding model and transformed FET and HE sector as contained in the Statement of Strategy. Once this examination is concluded the report will be submitted to Government for consideration in advance of its publication (pending agreement with the European Commission as the contracting authority).</p>  <p>  I have also been engaging with Government colleagues in relation to future funding for this sector as we work towards Government consideration of the report and decision on the key issues.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding, in advance of and since the publication of the 2016 it is important to note that significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Since 2015 annual expenditure allocated to higher education has increased by more than 40%.  In 2022 this allocation will be in excess of &euro;2billion.</p>  <p>This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector.  </p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.  </p>  <p>  HEA Student Record System (SRS) data shows that in 2019/20, 10% of new entrants came from DEIS Schools.  There is already extensive engagement between Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and DEIS schools. In an analysis carried out by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) at the start of the year, 98% of post-primary DEIS schools had links or engagement with a HEI.  </p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of  not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. </p>  <p>  Engagement with DEIS schools also features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3, including under the recent extension of a funding for another three years, include engagement with local DEIS schools.  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. The PATH 2 bursaries now with three tiers of support take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway. Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the HEA on the development of the new Plan with the intention of publishing the plan in Q1 of 2022. I am delighted to have recently announced additional funding of &euro;5m in 2022 to support the development of the new National Access Plan which I see as being more student centred, targeting specific under-represented groups and a move beyond the singular focus on access to HE with a strong focus on pathways.  Entry to higher education for students attending DEIS schools will be included as a KPI in the New Plan.</p></reply>

It is clear that unless these issues are tackled by moving to a single apprenticeship system, the potential to firmly embed apprenticeship as an attractive and sought-after mode of work based learning will be severely constrained in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The current structures have been subject to two major shocks within the past 20 years.  Firstly the collapse of the housing market in 2007 and its impact on craft apprenticeship and secondly the COVID pandemic in 2020 impacting on craft and post 2016 apprenticeships.  On both occasions, the partners in the education and training sector have come together to innovate and respond to the challenges faced by the system. On both occasions there have been learnings in relation to the ability of both craft and consortia apprenticeship operating structures to support the rapid change necessary to meet unforeseen challenges. </p>  <p>The single apprenticeship system builds on this, in aiming to deliver a structure which provides for local innovation combined with strong national level supports and coordination of the apprenticeship sector.  Migrating the existing structures to the single system will be planned in collaboration with system stakeholders and, for craft apprenticeship, will take place over the full duration of the Action Plan.   </p></reply>

Skills provision is underpinned by the framework of the National Skills Strategy, which is agile and responsive to changes in the world of work in order to address evolving skills needs.  This system is designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified higher education graduates and apprentices, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands.</p>  <p>  The number of students enrolled in higher education courses in engineering, manufacturing and construction has increased by 19% since 2014, rising from 23,400 to 27,900. The annual number of graduates from these courses has increased by 29.3%, from 6,900 to 8,900. These figures are expected to increase further over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The mainstream supply of graduates is supplemented with more targeted initiatives designed to meet specific skills needs.  The two key national targeted initiatives in the higher education system are Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.  Springboard+ 2021 was launched on 14th June 2021 and there are 46 Springboard+ 2021 courses in engineering with 1,657 places.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are another key component of our pipeline of skilled engineers. There are currently 14 apprenticeships available in engineering fields, ranging from Level 5 to Level 10 on the National Framework of Qualifications. As of October 2021 there were 2,697 apprentices registered on these programmes, 733 of which were newly registered this year. There are a further four apprenticeships in the engineering sector under development.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue working with enterprise agencies and industry groups, as well as the higher education institutions, to assess the future demand for higher education graduates and apprentices in engineering as well as our ability to meet this demand, and ensure we are prepared for the challenges ahead.</p></reply>

Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the COVID-related shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to access off-the-job training.   </p>  <p>  These measures have resulted in waiting lists for apprentices wishing to progress to off-the-job phases of their training.  At the end of October over 10,300 craft apprentices were waiting for an off-the-job training space.  Almost 70% of these were in one of three apprenticeships:  Electrical, Plumbing and Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery.</p>  <p>  Off-the-job training for craft apprenticeships generally takes place in three phases &ndash; Phase 2 is 22 weeks delivered in an ETB Training Centre, with Phases 4 and 6 each of between 10-12 weeks in duration are delivered in IoTs or Technological Universities. </p>  <p>  The following measures have been put in places to increase capacity to address the waiting lists:-</p>  <p>  - &euro;20m capital funding has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to provide additional structural capacity within Training Centres and IoTs/Technological Universities.  These places began to come on stream in September 2021, with 2,500 apprentices starting phases 4 or 6 compared to 2,100 in January 2020 (pre-COVID).</p>  <p>  - As from September 2021 classes have returned to full capacity of 14-16 apprentices per class, rather than the 50% capacity which had been in place during 2020 and until Q3, 2021 under COVID-19 distancing requirements. </p>  <p>  - The structure of Phase 2 delivery in the three most impacted apprenticeships is being reformed, with the institutions and partners working together to deliver an innovative teaching response to reduce waiting lists.  On-site teaching will be reduced to 18 weeks of practical work, with theory elements of the Phase delivered around the off-the-job training.  This will allow for a third intake of Phase 2 apprentices providing up to a 50% increase in availability of Phase 2 places annually. </p>  <p>  - &euro;17m targeted funding has been provided for additional craft apprenticeship classes in 2022 across the further and higher education sectors. </p>  <p>  - A significant recruitment campaign is under way to deliver the additional staffing to support the above measures. </p>  <p>  - Waiting lists are continually monitored and additional targeted measures will be introduced to ensure that craft apprentices impacted by these delays are enabled to qualify from their apprenticeship as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Subject to continued access to workshops and training facilities in addition to the rollout of additional places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training for phases 4 and 6 will be cleared by Easter 2021, with phase 2 waiting lists cleared by year-end 2022.  </p></reply>

A key goal for my Department is to enhance the visibility of further education and training (FET) and apprenticeship options for school leavers and the changes to allow school leavers explore options across the third level system, whether in higher education, further education or apprenticeship options, from the CAO website is a key development.  </p>  <p>  This initiative comes from the collaboration of a working group comprising representatives of SOLAS, the CAO, ETBI and the ETBs.  Within the FET sector, a central portal has been developed to enable learners to apply for their chosen courses, which have been updated in terms of course naming conventions and learner requirements.  This is being managed through FETCH / PLSS (which is a central application system for FET courses delivered through Education and Training Boards throughout the country).? Technical experts from SOLAS and the CAO are working together to ensure that technology developed for FET in the short-term aligns with CAO systems to enable integration over time.</p>  <p>  The further development and expansion of the CAO FET offers to include wider options will build on the experience of the 2022 application process. </p>  <p>  For apprenticeship options, students must first be hired by an approved apprentice employer.  There is a link to a dedicated page on the apprenticeship website which provides information on how to find an apprenticeship and links to available apprenticeship employment opportunities. There is also a freephone number available - 1800 794 487 for guidance on apprenticeships which is open 12pm-6pm Monday-Friday.</p>  <p>It is my understanding that the NCCA&rsquo;s Advisory Report on Senior Cycle Reform has been submitted to the Department of Education for consideration and is due to be published in the coming weeks.

With regard to Building Skills, there has been a sizable increase in the number of upskilling and reskilling opportunities made available through <i>Skills to Advance</i>, focussed on upskilling for those in employment, and <i>Skills to Compete</i>, a key SOLAS initiative to support those who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19 to re-enter the workforce, and through the expansion of eCollege.  Very significantly, the new Action Plan for Apprenticeships launched earlier this year sets a target of 10,000 new apprentices registering every year by 2025. </p><p>In the area of fostering inclusion, there have been two significant developments, namely the development of the Framework for Universal Design for Learning in FET and the launch and publication of the new 10 year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy, Adult Literacy for Life.  Both developments are significant and will help to enable every citizen to participate fully in society.</p><p>Turning to Creating Pathways, the enhancement of the CAO website for the 2022 CAO application process by the inclusion of links to information on, and applications for, FET programmes and to Apprenticeship information and employment opportunities is significant in enhancing the visibility of FET and apprenticeship options for school leavers.</p><p>Progress has also been made in the enabling themes identified in the FET Strategy - staffing, structures and capabilities, learner performance centred, digital transformation and capital infrastructure.  The FET strategy will underpin the development of new strategic performance agreements between SOLAS and each of the ETBs for the next three years, from 2022-2024 and the provision in Budget 2022 will support building the required capacity within the ETBs.</p></reply>

These HEI reports will shortly be received and analysed by the HEA, with a view to establishing a clear picture of institutional work undertaken in this area and identifying any priority areas where action may still need to be taken. </p><p>My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:</p><p>- NUIG Active Consent Programme</p><p>- UCC Bystander Training</p><p>- Speak Out report and support online platform</p><p>- The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWCI in conjunction with USI.</p><p>My Department is  partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub, that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.</p><p>The IUA has published guidelines entitled '<i>Guidelines for Universities on How to Respond to Alleged Staff or Student of University Related Sexual Misconduct'</i>, which are available to assist HEIs in this area.</p><p>THEA launched their PROPEL Report (Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence), in March 2021, with funding from my Department.  The PROPEL report details key components and options for inclusion in institutional action plans, outline of best practice and guidelines for emerging policies and procedures in this area and a series of conclusions and recommendations.</p><p>At my request, the HEA has carried out surveys of Staff and Students in higher education regarding their experiences of Sexual Harassment and Violence, the report is in the final stages of completion and will be published in the coming weeks. This will provide an evidence base to inform future policy in this area. </p></reply>

In my role as Minister for Further and Higher Education, it has, therefore, been a priority for me to highlight and communicate the need for a balanced tertiary education system.  To progress this key goal, from this year, school leavers will be able to explore options across the third level system, whether in higher education, further education or apprenticeship options, from the CAO website.</p>  <p>  While fully recognising the critical role of the higher education system, we are also working to strengthen the further education and training system under a new strategy for that sector.  This will help ensure that our tertiary education system as a whole equips our students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to secure good quality, well paid and sustainable employment.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Higher Education Authority will continue to engage actively with the higher education institutions on the availability of places in higher education and to build capacity in the higher education system.</p></reply>

It will ensure that Irish speakers can interact with the Government and access public services through a high standard of Irish. Further information on this bill can be found in the following link www.gov.ie/en/press-release/a8eef-official-languages-bill-amendment-2019-before-the-dail/.</p>  <p>  There is already a broad range of courses available in Irish in higher education institutions that will meet future demand. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative, funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is to ensure the availability of qualified persons with Irish language skills to meet recruitment needs in Ireland and the EU. Under this scheme the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht provides funding for a range of specialised third level Irish language courses in areas such as translation, interpretation and law. Further information on this Initiative can be found in the following link www.gov.ie/en/publication/7c05c-third-level-education/.</p>  <p>  Under the Advanced Irish Language Strategic Initiative there are 8 courses available in 5 different institutions. There were 73 students enrolled in these courses in 2019/2020 and 84 students enrolled in 2020/2021.</p>  <p>  As of 2020/21, there were 67 courses in Higher Education delivering Irish language tuition or delivered through the medium of Irish, a total of 1,674 students (6,283 since 2016/17). This includes courses in Teacher Training colleges, but excludes courses in Irish Studies, Irish history, folklore, music/dance and the likes. A further 1,021 students are recorded as taking Irish language as a subject as part of a further 37 courses (5,618 students since 2016/17).</p>  <p>  The Department distributes recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for disbursement directly to the HEA's designated higher education institutions. The HEA distributes this funding as a block grant to the institutions. As autonomous bodies, payment of this funding, including any expenditure on Irish-language education initiatives, falls to the individual institution.</p>  <p>  In addition, specific support is provided for the development of Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge in NUIG. The Department has agreed to provide an allocation of &euro;900,000 for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 academic years.</p>  <p>  The Acadamh is a research and educational institution which is intended to promote and develop Irish-medium education. It is headquartered in NUIG&rsquo;s main Galway City campus, but also has campuses in the Ceathr&uacute; Rua  and Carna in Connemara, and in the Doir&iacute; Beaga in Gaoth Dobhair, Donegal.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are autonomous, and determine themselves which Irish-language courses will be offered.

HEIs were requested to allocate funds towards student-facing services, including the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors and additional Assistant Psychologists.</p><p>In 2021, a further &euro;5 million was allocated to the higher education institutions to support student mental health and wellbeing. This funding allocated by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) included &euro;2m delivered through the Recurrent Grant Model to Higher Education Institutions along with an additional &euro;3m which I secured as part of the 2021 Covid-19 response package. Again HEIs were requested to allocate funds towards student-facing services.</p><p>HEIs were required to report on the use of funds to the HEA in July 2021. The HEA has analysed these reports and produced an overview report, which indicates the impacts of the funding.</p><p>This has included:</p><p>- increased capacity for students to avail of mental health services., especially in the provision of one-to-one sessions, and also, access to psychologists and in some institutions, topsychiatrists;</p><p>- additional and significant provisions offered include webinars, group sessions, online forums and the development of regular newsletters and e-zines, as well as increased social media presence;</p><p>- innovative outreach events and workshops were also instigated and reported on by HEIs and these provisions catered for consent, suicide prevention, addictive behaviours and vulnerable groups.</p><p>- HEIs have developed systems and structures for improving services and other activities. For example, in larger institutions, case management and triaging processes have been implemented;</p><p>- HEI staff have been able to avail of training sessions on mental health, thereby, raising the profile internally within HEIs of what services and supports are available for students.</p><p>The HEA encourages all HEIs in receipt of this funding to assist in the implementation of the following Frameworks:</p><p>- National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework;</p><p>- Framework for Consent in HEIs; Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions. </p><p>The outcome of this funding has resulted in all HEIs reporting a reduction in waiting times, with some HEIs offering rapid access resources. In addition, it is significant that HEIs proactively reach out to students rather than wait to contact Mental Health services.

This comprises tuition fee funding via the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;357m to meeting the tuition fee costs of over 146,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution. In addition, over 65,000 students have all or part of the &euro;3,000 student contribution paid on their behalf under the Student Grant Scheme at a cost of over &euro;190m.</p>  <p>  This substantial funding support has played a very important role in enabling access to and growth in higher education in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department's Statement of Strategy, which I published on 8 March last, contains a commitment to put in place a sustainable funding model for the higher education.  This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education (2016), was commissioned under the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme in November 2019. The final report deliverable was agreed between the Commission (DG Reform) and it's consultants at the end of May 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced its examination of the report's analysis, findings, conclusions and recommendations in order to develop proposals to present to Government to seek it&rsquo;s support to a sustainable future funding model and transformed FET and HE sector as contained in the Statement of Strategy. Once this examination is concluded the report will be submitted to Government for consideration in advance of its publication (pending agreement with the European Commission as the contracting authority).</p>  <p>  I have also been engaging with Government colleagues in relation to future funding for this sector as we work towards Government consideration of the report and decision on the key issues.</p>  <p>In terms of funding, in advance of and since the publication of the 2016 it is important to note that significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Since 2015 annual expenditure allocated to higher education has increased by more than 40%.  In 2022 this allocation will be in excess of &euro;2billion. This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector.  </p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.  A range of supports and measures are in place for learners with disabilities; some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student populace. </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education.  14,000 students are supported annually under the fund. Supports in the FET sector for learners with a disability include access to the Fund for Students with a Disability (FSD), a wide range of reasonable accommodations depending on the learner&rsquo;s needs, the Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), as well as provision of specific programmes for learners with a disability who may require more intensive supports through Specialist Training Provision (STP). </p>  <p>  We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. We are currently preparing a new National Access Plan, which will look at specific measures for people with intellectual disabilities. While there is significant provision for students with intellectual disabilities in the further education and training sector where there were 2,821 learners with intellectual disabilities in 2019 and some provision in the higher education sector involving a comparatively small number of learners I have asked my officials to engage with the HEA and SOLAS to see where we can play a stronger role, in meeting the educational needs of this group as part of a coherent whole of Government response. We are at an early stage of work in this area, but it is an area I am strongly committed to pursuing.</p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), and the 16 ETBs across the country have progressed a series of actions to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion through the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines to promote inclusion throughout FET, including for learners with a disability. This includes the development of a conceptual framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for the FET Sector, which aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. </p></reply>

Earlier this year I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.8m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  It is important to state the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.2% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declaring a disability.</p>  <p>    However, we acknowledge more needs to be done.

In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution required from the apprentice.</p>  <p>  For craft apprenticeships, the ASC charged is typically one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT or Technological University.  In the case of consortia-led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as off-the-job training has a more flexible structure, ranging from periods of block release to one day per week or remote learning options. </p>  <p>  The ASC applies to all learners attending a higher education institution. In relation to construction related apprenticeships there has been a significant recovery in registrations in 2021. As a demand driven programme, the number of apprentice placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 rising to 3,499 in 2019 and 3,924 registrations on construction and electrical related apprenticeships at the end of October 2021.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the existing construction related craft apprenticeships at level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications, apprenticeships are currently in development in roofing and cladding (L5) and advanced quantity surveyor (L9).</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 is a five year plan which sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The plan will deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025 across all sectors of the economy including construction. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan, craft apprenticeships will migrate from a centralised model of delivery managed by SOLAS to a distributed model of delivery led by industry and education and training providers. This will deliver greater responsiveness to changing demand and it will be delivered over the full duration of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Additionally, throughout the duration of the plan, a new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) will drive central branding and promotional activities targeted to heighten public awareness of the range of apprenticeship offerings in all sectors including construction. </p>  <p>Where a skills need is identified within a sector then a defined employer-led process for proposing and developing an apprenticeship is available through the www.apprenticeship.ie site.  Where new and emerging skills needs are identified then actions under the plan will ensure that employers receive practical supports and advice should they wish to develop an apprenticeship within their sector.   </p></reply>

Within the meaning of these Acts, higher education institutions are autonomous with regard to management of their academic affairs and the location of their campuses. </p>  <p>  For example, IT Carlow currently has a footprint in Counties Wexford and Wicklow as well as Carlow, and the former Limerick IT, now dissolved and part of the new Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest retained a campus presence in Counties Clare and Tipperary as well as Limerick.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 reiterate the pivotal role of higher education in regional development. Future Jobs Ireland also strongly endorses the role of technological higher education to drive the development of regional clusters with a particular focus on innovation, technology and SMEs.</p>  <p>  In this context the symbiotic relationship between a Technological University and its region strongly resonates with a core priority under the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 to create regionally based clusters or networks of learning and research. The TURN report of 2019 is the blueprint for TUs in the state and it emphasises the regional development role of this new type of HEI. The functions of TUs under the Technological Universities Act 2018 include the provision of  programmes of education and training that reflect the needs of individuals, business, enterprise, the professions, the community, local interests and other stakeholders in the region in which the campuses of the technological university are located and collaboration with business, enterprise, the professions, the community, local interests and related stakeholders in the region.  It is worth noting that all TUs are multi-campus institutions. For example, the aforementioned Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, recently established in October, encompasses six campuses throughout Ireland&rsquo;s Midwest and Midlands region with more than 14,000 students enrolled in hundreds of courses across four counties. The latest TU to be designated in the West /North West, to be known as the Atlantic Technological University upon establishment, has a campus presence in Castlebar, Killybegs, Letterfrack  and  Mountbellew as well as Galway, Sligo and Letterkenny.   </p></reply>

The plan will deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.  </p>  <p>  The Plan will address the clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people of all ages, be they progressing in their career, school leavers, career changers or the unemployed. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Currently 31.1% of the overall apprenticeship population are over 25 years of age. In a number of recently developed apprenticeships such as CGI Technical Assistant, Equipment Systems Engineer and Principal Engineer the over 25 cohort rises to 100%. Across all of the 37 more recently developed apprenticeships the average age of apprentices is 27.</p>  <p>  A new National Apprenticeship Office will make accessing information on, and engagement with, apprenticeship more straightforward for both learners of all ages and employers.  In 2022 we will launch financial supports for employers of apprentices and the public service will set out a roadmap for the recruitment of apprentices. </p>  <p>Under the Action Plan the impacts of, and outcomes from, existing access to apprenticeship and pre apprenticeship programmes as well as other interventions across the sector will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions to deliver an apprentice population which better reflects the general population.  Enhanced cooperation with the State's Public Employment Service as set out in the Plan will also increase visibility of apprenticeship to employers and career changers.  </p></reply>

This will continue to be the case in upcoming campaigns.</p><p>For example, the current #ProtectOurProgress campaign from the Government Information Service (GIS) which is running on the MerrionStreet.ie social channels emphasises the importance of fresh air. In addition, the most recent national and local press and radio campaign conducted by GIS (which ran over 10 days from 19th October 2021) referred to the importance of well-ventilated indoor spaces.</p><p>Ventilation is also embedded as a key measure in the current #LayerUp campaign from the Department of Health.  As part of this campaign, the Department of Health have updated and refreshed the public health COVID-19 signage and this collateral has been disseminated widely to Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders for public display. </p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) have a range of multi-channel COVID-19 communications campaigns ongoing, covering both COVID-19 Protection and COVID-19 Vaccines. The COVID-19 Protection campaign features strong visual reminders of the behaviours that prevent COVID-19&rsquo;s spread and is live on TV, digital video and social media. The first advert is live at the moment and covers wearing a mask, cleaning hands and giving space. The HSE is developing a second TV advert as part of this campaign which will focus on ventilation, the COVID pass and other measures. This is due to be complete in the coming weeks.</p><p>In mid-May of this year, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment highlighted the importance of both natural and mechanical ventilation as part of the broader Work Safely social media campaign on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p>The social media messages, which included a short video and images, stressed the importance of ventilation as a method for both employers and employees to work safely. The social media messages also highlighted the ventilation advice within the Work Safely Protocol. </p><p>The Department ran a paid advertising campaign on Facebook and Instagram promoting Work Safely from June to September 2021 and an organic campaign is ongoing on Twitter and LinkedIn platforms.</p><p>The Department also engaged directly with representative bodies on ventilation, circulating information posters for employers and employees, including a ventilation <b>dos and don&rsquo;ts</b>poster.  In addition, the Department promoted each updating of the Work Safe Protocol, including the ventilation section within, and also promoted a new Health and Safety Authority ventilation checklist. </p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has developed guidance for youth services in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Guidance for Youth Work Organisations references the significance of ventilation and how it will remain a core component of our COVID-19 response. The Department hosts a Youth Sector COVID-19 Oversight Group where key stakeholders meet with the Department to discuss the Guidance. The use of ventilation was discussed and emphasised at these meetings. In June 2021 the Department launched a capital programme for Early Learning and Care and School-Aged Childcare services which provided &euro;4.6 million in funding for services to enhance their outdoor facilities, improve ventilation indoors and purchase Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors.  The purpose of the capital programme was to support infection control by supporting services to increase the time children spent outdoors, and to improve ventilation in services when the children were indoors.</p><p>The Department of Education has issued clear and practical guidance for schools on the steps to be taken by all schools to manage ventilation levels.</p><p>Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May 2021, updating guidance previously issued,  following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on gov.ie. </p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The guidance outlines that CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial, to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school.  In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to primary (18,262) and post-primary (17,215) schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million.</p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices, etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  </p><p>Where the above measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p><p>The Department continues to advise schools on these measures through guidance issued to all schools,  regular meetings with management bodies and the education partners and support of individual schools through its COVID-19 helpline for schools.</p><p>Through the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, the Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme provided grants for capital projects and works to address challenges associated with COVID-19 and that supported the recovery of the commercial creative, cultural, entertainment and events sector. Funding up to &euro;25,000 was offered to facilitate capital works that assisted organisations in reopening and continue to operate safely for staff and audiences.  The list of types of expenditure that was eligible for funding included the installation or modification of ventilation systems.  </p><p>Transport operators have added signage on the windows of vehicles where windows can be opened asking customers to leave them open.</p><p>Lastly, it should be noted that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has updated and published its guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation as recently as 18th November 2021.</p></reply>

The funding for Tourism in Budget 2022 amounting to &euro;288.5m represents an increase of &euro;67.6m over the 2021 allocation. This includes &euro;50m funding for further Tourism Business Continuity Supports to assist strategic tourism businesses with their survival and recovery.  This funding will assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until summer 2022 when it is expected that inbound tourism will recover.

Five phases of this Scheme have been launched since the beginning of 2021. Phases 4 and 5 closed for applications on 24 September 2021. By  the end of 2021 hundreds of tourism businesses will have received vital funding to help them survive the impacts of the pandemic. Hundreds more will again receive support in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;50m for the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, the budget measures include a &euro;35m increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund in 2022 to enable Tourism Ireland to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Funding is also being provided for a range of initiatives including domestic marketing and festivals, supporting the digitalisation of tourism businesses as well as skills development and staff retention.  &euro;36.5m is also being  provided in capital funding for tourism product development for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.</p>  <p>  The supports for Tourism also include a range of cross-Government measures which will assist the sector in its recovery and growth. Tourism enterprises continue to benefit from measures such as the continuation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to April 2022, tax warehousing and a commercial rates waiver while the 9% VAT rate for hospitality remains in place until September 2022.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Ventilation, under the Department of Health, has completed its initial programme of work and, to allow for greater integration and collaboration with relevant government departments and stakeholders on the further development of sector specific ventilation guidance, the group now works with the Senior Officials Group to further inform sectoral guidance and public information regarding ventilation. Specific supports for ventilation have not been set up but as you are aware, the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  The Government has worked to ensure that there is a range of assistance in place for COVID-19-impacted businesses including the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme. For further information, businesses are advised to view my Department&rsquo;s website at enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/Government-supports-to-COVID-19-impacted-businesses.html.</p>  <p>It is important to note that all businesses supports are being kept under review to ensure that they are timely and target those that need them the most.  </p></reply>

In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews. The reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments.</p>  <p>  Bus and Coach drivers are included on the Ineligible Occupations List.  In order to add or remove an occupation from the lists, evidence is sought demonstrating that recruitment difficulties are solely due to genuine shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions. The review process invites stakeholders, through the public consultation, to provide data to substantiate claims of lack of skills or labour availability in a detailed evidence-based business case. Sectors are also advised to engage in a systematic and structured manner with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  The most recent review of the Occupations Lists concluded on 27th October. In response to the public consultation, 29 submissions were received from a range of bodies including the Agri/Food, Hospitality and Transport/Logistics sectors. The Economic Migration Policy Unit of my Department informs me that no submissions were received for the occupation of Bus or Coach Drivers. While consideration of the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market had a significant influence on the outcome of the review, changes were announced to address the more immediate skills and labour shortages across key sectors.</p>  <p>  The next review will commence with a public consultation in the coming months with commencement announced on the Department's website.  Contact details may also be forwarded to the Department for those who wish to receive email notification of the consultation phase.</p></reply>

These trade missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.</p>  <p>  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ministerial-led trade missions and events took place virtually throughout Quarters 1 to 3 of 2021.  There were no physical Ministerial-led trade missions planned for Australia in 2021 due to travel restrictions, therefore the focus of Enterprise Ireland teams on the ground remained on working one to one with the 300+ companies doing business in Australia.</p>  <p>  Physical Ministerial-led trade missions recommenced in September 2021 with missions taking place to the UK, France and Germany and to the UAE and Qatar in October 2021and to Canada and the USA and to Saudi Arabia and Dubai in November 2021. A further trade mission to Finland and Liverpool is taking place this December. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present for a Ministerial-led trade mission to Australia in early 2022.  My Department is currently in contact with Enterprise Ireland with a view to developing a Ministerial-led Trade Mission Programme for 2022 and no decisions have yet been made in relation to the final Programme. While the 2022 Programme is being developed, Enterprise Ireland is also making plans for a robust programme of in-market events for 2022 as Covid-19 restrictions begin to lift globally.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with its agencies to assess opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland, including in markets in the Asia-Pacific region such as Australia.    </p></reply>

This Office, which is chaired by the Minister for State, Se&aacute;n Fleming has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on the issues surrounding competition. Its aim is to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. </p>  <p>  Minister of State S&eacute;an Fleming recently met with CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland to discuss a variety of issues with them including expanding their risk appetite. The Office (which can be contacted at insurancecompetition@finance.gov.ie) is also working closely with the IDA to advertise the reform agenda to potential new market entrants. </p>  <p>  Government provides an extensive package of supports to business and my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie sets out a range of information, including details of COVID-19 business supports.

My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has undertaken an initial investigation into the matter and established that the premises is a new build and that neighbouring properties can access high speed broadband. My Department has raised a query with the network operator who has confirmed that the issue is system related and the network operator will review and hopefully rectify the matter to allow the order for the high speed broadband service to be placed with the resident&rsquo;s service provider.</p></reply>

The over-riding objective is to ensure that, by 2030, all packaging placed on the Irish market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way. The plan sets out a level of ambition which will position Ireland as a frontrunner towards the attainment of EU packaging recycling targets.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Single Use Plastics Directive requires that Member States take necessary measures to ensure separate collection for recycling. To that end, by 2025, Ireland must ensure the separate collection of 77% of plastic beverage bottles placed on the market (by weight), rising to 90% by 2029. In order to achieve this, I recently signed the Separate Collection (Deposit Return Scheme) Regulations 2021, to enable the establishment of a Deposit Return Scheme in Ireland, which will be introduced in Q3 2022. The Deposit Return Scheme will achieve the separate collection targets for PET plastic bottles set out in the Single Use Plastics Directive and the recycling targets for aluminium established in directives on packaging and packaging waste. While there are no targets set for the recycling of plastic beverage bottles, it is expected that the material  collected by the Deposit Return Scheme will be of high quality, leading to increased recycling levels of this packaging type.  </p>  <p>  Consumption reduction is, of course, preferential to increased recycling and it is my intention to publish a suite of consumption reduction measures for single use plastic food containers and cups under Article 4 of the Single Use Plastics Directive, when the format for these measures is agreed at EU level.</p></reply>

Three bands of salmon exploitation rates were set, low (average 5%) medium (average 15%) and high (average 35%). Each river was allocated a rod exploitation rate based on the level of salmon angling taking place. Generally, rivers open for catch and release were categorised as the low rod exploitation rate. However, if fishery staff indicate a higher rod exploitation rate, then this higher rate is applied to predict the total salmon run. Where the level of salmon angling has increased, the rod exploitation rate has also increased. </p>  <p>  To account for the low fishing pressure during summer 2018 due to the exceptionally dry and hot weather conditions, the exploitation rates were reduced generally by 50%, where the catch figure was used to estimate the stock. In rivers such as the Barrow, Nore and Suir which jointly considers the one-sea-winter grilse and multi-sea-winter stock components, the reduction was generally applied only to the one-sea-winter grilse portion of the total angling catch. However, the 2018 exploitation rate for the River Suir was subsequently reassigned to a standard low exploitation rate as the 2018 catch records showed over double the estimated catch originally provided for.</p>  <p>  For salmon rivers without fish counters like the Barrow, Nore and Suir, the Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS) use the recorded salmon rod catch on each river for the most recent five-year period in conjunction with a range of rod exploitation rates to provide an estimate of the total salmon run. A five-year average is used to avoid a disproportionate impact from a good or bad year. Counter data is one of a number of indices used to estimate salmon runs and IFI has a range of fish counters nationwide from which index data may be extrapolated. There are currently no plans to install fish counters on the Suir, Nore and the Barrow. </p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. This project has been selected for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will be co-funded by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Exchequer funding. The target for introduction of the scheme is mid-2022.</p>  <p>  The loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint. The specific features of the scheme are still under development.</p>  <p>  The loan guarantee is expected to help to increase the volume of retrofit activity within the State and improve the recovery and resilience of the supply chain within the retrofit sector. The scheme will also signal to the banking sector new viable business opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

From 3rd July this year single use plastic cutlery, plates, stirrers, straws, balloon sticks and cotton bud sticks may not be placed on the Irish market. This ban also applies to single use expanded polystyrene cups and food containers and all products containing oxo-degradable plastic. Other measures arising from SUP Directive will be implemented in the coming years, including the introduction of new Extended Producer Responsibility schemes for material such as tobacco products and fishing gear.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme for plastic beverage bottles and aluminium cans will  assist in reducing single use plastics and will help Ireland meet EU targets while promoting a wider circular economy.

It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  However, there are houses and dwellings in Ireland where home charging is not an option, due to the lack of driveway or garden. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan 21 includes a number of actions to facilitate the increased provision of EV charging infrastructure, much of which will be targeted at providing charging solutions for those without access to home chargers. These include</p>  <p>  - Establish an Office for Low Emitting Vehicles to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure</p>  <p>  - Develop a national infrastructure strategy to address on-street, location and fastcharging infrastructure needs to stay ahead of demand, having particular regard to non-urban needs </p>  <p>  - Enable greater EV infrastructure roll-out for passenger cars and vans</p>  <p>  - Launch a Destination Charger Scheme to install publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure</p>  <p>  - Amend the Home Charger Grant Scheme to include apartment</p>  <p>  A national ambition has been firmly established that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable. In addition to the above actions, the Climate Action Plan outlines a pathway to a radical and equitable transformation in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector over the next nine years as it moves towards decarbonisation.  </p></reply>

A national charging infrastructure strategy is due for publication early next year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.   </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. I would be very happy to consider any applications from Kerry County Council under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

The Department completed this work over the following months and, in September of last year, informed the Commission that Directive 2017/159 had been transposed in full.  A response from the EU Commission is awaited.</p>  <p>  To note, in recent days, a separate Directive, 2019/1834, amending Directive 92/29/EC with regard to safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels has been transposed.  In transposing that amending Directive, my Department produced a consolidated statutory instrument to transpose Directive 92/29/EC as amended and revoked the original transposing statutory instrument.  As part of that consolidation, my Department also took the opportunity to include provisions from the Work in Fishing Directive (2017/159) related to medical care on board vessels, which had already been transposed by way of SI 258/2020 and SI 259/2020 and to revoke those two original transposing statutory instruments.  </p>  <p>  The reasoning behind this approach was to produce a consolidated text detailing the legal requirements for the provision of medical supplies and equipment on board vessels making it easier for industry to identify and meet their legal obligations.  Now all of the requirements are set out in a single text rather than four separate Statutory Instruments. The EU Commission has been notified of the updated national execution measures for both Directive 92/29/EC as amended and Directive 2017/159.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to put in place the necessary measures to improve the transposition, implementation and enforcement of transport law in Ireland. As previously mentioned, a dedicated EU Coordination Unit within my Department is responsible for engaging with the EU Commission on these issues and works closely with responsible Officials in the Department of Transport, and other Departments as required, in response to each case.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, in June 2020, the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services. The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.</p>  <p>  Owing to the continued fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  The NTA are currently carrying out a review of the supports to the licensed bus sector which I expect to receive shortly. No decision has been taken in relation to a potential continuation of these supports.</p></reply>

The European Court of Justice made a judgment in this case on 9 July 2020.

On 7 September 2020, my Department communicated to the European Commission that Directive 2017/159 had been transposed in full. On 23 July 2021, my Department communicated to the European Commission that Directive 2018/645 had been transposed in full. The Department of Transport is awaiting the views of the Commission in these cases.</p>  <p>  The final case relates to a recently issued Letter of Formal Notice regarding Directive (EU) 2019/520 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems and facilitating cross-border exchange of information on the failure to pay road fees in the Union.

A Public Dancing Licence is separate to a liquor licence. A Public Dancing Licence fee includes court fees of &euro;335 and excise duties of &euro;155 bringing the total amount to &euro;490. These licences are administered by the Courts Service which collects the relevant excise duties and remits them to Revenue. </p>  <p>  As part of the range of measures introduced last year to support businesses impacted by the Covid-19 situation,  the Government decided to waive the Public Dancing Licence fee for 2020 and, earlier this year, decided to extend that waiver for 2021. The support package also included a waiver of the fees chargeable on the renewal of certain liquor licences in the 2020 licensing period which has also since been extended in respect of renewals during 2021.</p>  <p>  The excise component of the Public Dancing Licence waiver was brought into law through Section 31 of the Finance Act 2020 and will be extended to 2021 through this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, which is currently before the House.</p>  <p>  The court fees component of the Public Dancing Licence waiver was brought into law through the District Court (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2020 (S.I. No. 439 of 2020), and extended to 2021 through the District Court (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2021 (S.I. No. 444 of 2021), which were both signed by the Ministers for Justice and Equality and for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I understand that the Courts Service put in place arrangements to provide refunds for relevant Public Dancing Licence fees (comprising excise duties and court fees) paid prior to the coming into operation of the initial Order. </p>  <p>  Therefore, no fees are payable in respect of applications for Public Dancing Licences in 2020 or 2021. This measure, coupled with the extension of the waiver for renewal of liquor licences, is an important support for the hospitality sector impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

For VAT provisions, the communication refers to the fact that Member States can decide to apply reduced rates of VAT on energy products, but only within the confines of what is already provided for in the VAT Directive.  As you know, the current structure of VAT rates in the Directive provides for the application of one or two reduced rates and limits the application of those rates to supplies listed in Annex III.  The Directive provides that the reduced rates may not be lower than 5%. </p>  <p>  Within this rates structure, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III.  Under this framework, Ireland has a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.  Also, Ireland has retained its historic application of one of the reduced rates of VAT, 13.5%, to a range of services (including the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services) and, under the Directive, the rate applicable to such services cannot be reduced below 12%. </p>  <p>  If Ireland did reduce the rate below 12%, even on a temporary basis, we would not be able to retain the derogation we currently hold that allows us to apply a reduced rate.  This means that the VAT rate on electricity, gas, oil and fuel would increase to 23% when the temporary relief had expired.  </p></reply>

This measure gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. The main aim of the policy underpinning the design of scheme is to help encourage the building of additional new properties.</p><p>A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming he or she meets various conditions specified in the section.  The main conditions include that the claimant is a first-time purchaser, the claimant has a qualifying loan on the property in question and the claimant has completed a tax return form and is tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.  Also, the new property must be occupied as the sole or main residence of a first-time purchaser. </p><p>The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. The HTB scheme operates by way of a payment being made at deposit stage following the signing of a contract to purchase, or, in the case of a self-build, following the drawdown of the first tranche of the relevant mortgage. The HTB scheme has been widely publicised since its announcement in 2016, particularly by financial institutions providing mortgages. </p><p><b>The Living City Initiative</b></p><p>The Living City Initiative (LCI) is a tax incentive aimed at the regeneration of the historic inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. The scheme provides income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in refurbishing/converting qualifying pre-1915 buildings which are located within 'Special Regeneration Areas'.</p><p>There are three types of relief available; owner occupier residential relief, rented residential (landlord) relief and commercial or retail relief. The rented residential relief was introduced with effect from 1 January 2017. Owner occupier relief is given by writing off qualifying expenditure incurred on the property against total income at a rate of 10% per annum over ten years. Rented residential and commercial relief is given by way of capital allowances, with eligible expenditure incurred on the property being written off over seven years at a rate of 15% per annum over 6 years and 10% in the final year.</p><p>Sections 372AAA to 372AAD Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outline the conditions applicable to each element of the LCI. Further information on those conditions are available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-10/10-13-01.pdf .</p><p><b>Stamp duty</b></p><p>Where there is a transfer of residential property, stamp duty is charged at the rate of 1% on the first &euro;1 million of the consideration and 2% on any excess over &euro;1 million. Transfers of non&ndash;residential property, including agricultural land, attract a stamp duty charge at the rate of 7.5% of the consideration.  </p><p>Section 83D of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 provides for a refund of stamp duty paid on the transfer of non-residential land where the land is subsequently developed for residential purposes.  To qualify for a refund, construction operations must commence on the land within the period of 30 months of the transfer, but no later than 31 December 2022.  The amount refundable is calculated by reference to the difference between stamp duty paid at the rate of 7.5% and the stamp duty that would have been paid had the rate been 2% (2% was the rate that applied to the transfer of non-residential property prior to 11 October 2017).  The refund scheme applies to both single dwelling units (one-off houses) and multi-unit developments. In the case of multi-unit developments, 75% of the total surface area of the land must be occupied by dwelling units, or the gross floor space of the dwelling units must account for at least 75% of the total surface area of the land.  The refund scheme is intended to encourage developers to convert non-residential land into residential land, thereby creating extra housing capacity.</p></reply>

The purpose of providing tax relief for pension contributions is to encourage saving - by employers, employees and the self-employed - towards retirement income. Any early drawdowns from a pension fund, for any purpose, would reduce the pension savings from which individuals could provide for their retirement, with smaller pension schemes losing a larger proportion of their overall savings.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy is suggesting that early drawdown of pension funds be allowed in certain defined circumstances, to fund the installation of microgeneration projects in private dwellings, it is not clear whether it would be intended that the drawdown to be available from all pension products or only certain products.</p>  <p>  As an exceptional measure, with a view of relieving hardship during the financial crisis early drawdown from pension funds was permitted. However, it was for a limited period of time and early drawdown was confined to only one type of pension product -  additional voluntary contributions (AVCs).  Section 782A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year period, from 27 March 2013 to 26 March 2016, during which they could draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of their AVCs. The amount drawn down was subject to income tax under Schedule E, PRSI and USC, which was collected under the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates what is described as an &ldquo;Exempt &ndash; Exempt &ndash; Taxed&rdquo; or &ldquo;EET&rdquo; pension regime. Contributions to a pension fund are relieved from tax and growth in these funds are also accumulated on a tax-free basis. Payments out of the fund during retirement are then subject to income tax, and USC and PRSI where applicable. The introduction of a tax relief scheme to allow early drawdown of pension funds could undermine the integrity of the &ldquo;EET&rdquo; regime. Therefore, I do not have any plans to introduce such a measure.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, in Finance Bill 2021 I have included a provision for a tax disregard in respect of personal income received by households who sell residual electricity that they generate back to the grid. The amount of the disregard will be set at &euro;200. This figure should ensure that most will pay no tax on income from this source. The measure will operate for an initial period of three years with a sunset clause applying at the end of 2024.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-30a.405.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000073#WRH01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198, 203 and 208 together.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (25th November) by EWSS is almost &euro;6.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.58 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;877 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 690,300 employees. </p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  This 30% reduction metric, which applies on a self-assessment basis, has been in place since EWSS came into effect in September 2020.  I would also draw attention to the fact that, despite the exit from restrictions, it was not tightened in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 which was enacted in the summer and which extended the scheme beyond end-June 2021 nor is there any proposal to do so in the provisions of Finance Bill which is currently being debated by the Oireachtas.   In fact, the reference period to which the metric must be applied was broadened out in the above Act to span a full year thus effectively relaxing the conditionality to qualify to benefit from the scheme in most cases. </p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time it is necessary to gradually unwind and phase out this temporary emergency support measure. That is why, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals insofar as possible during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  As regards the EWSS and the current circumstances referenced by the Deputies in their questions, the Government continues to monitor developments closely and will consider if any response is required at an appropriate time. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would draw the Deputies attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available over the course of the last 18 months or so &ndash; including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. Details of the supports are available on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s website at the following link enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/. </p></reply>

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules that require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, neither my Department nor I have responsibility for the enforcement of the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018, which fall under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and I am unable to comment on the specific scenario that the Deputy has asked about.  On a general level, the Equal Status Acts prohibit certain kinds of discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, obtaining or disposing of accommodation and in relation to educational establishments. The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including disability. However, in relation to insurance, the Deputy should be aware that the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any of the grounds (except gender) &ndash; but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and are reasonable.  </p>  <p>  From a financial services perspective, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. This Information Service can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. </p></reply>

The amount of the LPT-related surcharge that is generated will be equal to 10% of the income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax chargeable.</p><p>In effect, the surcharge is applied as if the income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax return has been filed more than 2 months late.  If the income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax return is actually filed after the appropriate due date for filing the return, a late filing surcharge will be applied to that return and an LPT-related late filing surcharge will not also be applied.  So there is no question of a double penalty being applied.</p><p>Where a person incurs an LPT-related surcharge and they subsequently bring their LPT payments and returns up-to-date, Revenue will cap the surcharge at 100% of the person&rsquo;s LPT liability.  In recognition of the high LPT compliance rate shown by self-employed taxpayers to date, this year in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021, I provided for a 50% reduction in this cap.  This means that where the amount of an LPT-related surcharge exceeds 50% of a person&rsquo;s LPT liability and the person subsequently brings their LPT obligations up to date, the surcharge payable will be capped at 50% of their LPT liability.  This change will take effect from 1 January 2022.</p><p>In addition to this change, I am advised by Revenue that in acknowledgement of the requirement for all residential property owners in the State to file an LPT return for the 2022 to 2025 valuation period during the busy income tax return filing period, outstanding LPT returns or payments for 2022 did not trigger a surcharge for the 2020 Form 11 return.  It should be noted, however, that any outstanding LPT returns or payments for 2021 or earlier years would have resulted in an LPT-related surcharge being triggered. </p><p>The Deputy has asked me for my views on whether it may be more appropriate to apply such penalties to self-assessed taxpayers&rsquo; tax records rather than applied in the current form.  </p><p>The background to the introduction of the LPT-related surcharge was the need to provide a balance between the LPT compliance measures that applied to property owners who were employees and those that were self-assessed.  In the case of employees, Revenue can make it mandatory for an employer to deduct the LPT liability at source from a person&rsquo;s salary, in the same way that income tax and PRSI is deducted.  A similar compliance measure is not generally possible where tax is not deductible at source: an exception is the deduction of LPT from certain EU payments made to farmers by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; non-compliance with LPT obligations will also affect a person&rsquo;s tax clearance status.  It is within this context that the surcharge was introduced.  </p><p>As the rationale for providing for this balance in LPT compliance measures still exists, I do not propose making any further changes to the basis on which the LPT-related surcharge is applied.However, as noted above, as a result of changes I made to the LPT legislation this year, self-assessed taxpayers that incur an LPT-related surcharge and subsequently bring their LPT obligations up-to-date will benefit from the reduced cap in the surcharge to 50% of their LPT liability from 1 January 2022.</p></reply>

Since 1 July 2021, all goods imported to the Union, regardless of their value, are liable to VAT. In addition, all goods valued at &euro;150 or more may be liable to a Customs duty charge. </p>  <p>  The Customs value on which Customs duty is calculated is the cost of the goods plus the transport costs (including postage), any insurance fees and any handling charges to deliver the goods to the EU. VAT is calculated on the Customs value, plus any Customs duty applicable. In addition, postal operators and courier businesses may charge an administration fee for the delivery of the goods.</p>  <p>  Generally, a UK retailer does not charge UK VAT on goods which are being exported from their territory. However, some delivery services use a proxy address in the UK. In these instances, from the perspective of the UK retailer and the operation of the VAT system in the UK, this appears as a sale within the UK, and not an export, and as a result is liable to UK VAT. When calculating the Customs value upon importation to Ireland, the invoice value is used in the calculation. Where the invoice value includes UK VAT then this will be included in the calculation of the Customs Value. </p>  <p>   The charging of VAT in the UK including any refund of UK VAT, is a matter for the retailer in the UK. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department maintains the Code of Practice for FOI which details the roles and responsibilities in the administration of the FOI system.  The Central Policy Unit also operates a helpdesk that is available to advise and guide decision makers in relation to issues they may have in implementing the FOI regime.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has put in place a standardised training framework for FOI, in order to inculcate a strong knowledge of what is required under the FOI system throughout the civil and public service.  Since this arrangement was first put in place in 2015, more than 7,000 officers across the system have received training through the framework. </p>  <p>  Section 27(14) of the Act obliges public bodies to endeavour to put in place mechanisms to facilitate payments required in processing an FOI request by electronic means.  This position is reflected in the code, manuals and sample letters.</p>  <p>  While my Department has produced supports and guidance around the FOI process, I should also acknowledge the excellent guidance documents on the operation of the legislation that have been published by the Office of the Information Commissioner, which have proven invaluable to decision-makers across the system.</p>  <p>  I also note that the basic requirements for an FOI decision have a statutory basis under section 13 of the Act, while the Information Commissioner has powers to direct that a revised decision is issued where this standard is not met.  Only three such directions were made in 2020, for context 32,652 FOI requests were handled by public bodies in that year, and the Commissioner observed in his Annual Report that this notably low number was part of a continuing trend of improvement.</p>  <p>  Finally the FOI system covers approximately 600 organisations that are diverse in terms of size, functions and structure.  As such, while I have outlined the supports that are available to decision makers, it is ultimately a matter for each decision maker to apply the legislation and guidance as appropriate in the circumstances of a particular request, and for each organisation to tailor the general approach where necessary to meet its own circumstances. </p></reply>

In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process. </p><p>Since 2018, significant work has been undertaken to develop the initiative and Equality Budgeting has been expanded across multiple dimensions of equality including gender, socio-economic, disability and minority groups.  </p><p>In 2019, the OECD was requested by my Department, and the Department of Justice and Equality, to conduct a scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. The published report supported the approach taken, and also provided twelve recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is well advanced. </p><p>A key OECD recommendation, that will underpin overall implementation, was the establishment of an inter-departmental network of Equality Budgeting contact points.  </p><p>In March of this year, Government agreed to establish an inter-departmental network on Equality Budgeting in order to facilitate the full implementation of Equality Budgeting across all departments, in line with this OECD recommendation. </p><p>Following a request for nominees, the network first meet in June, and has since met on two further dates in July and November.</p><p>The inter-departmental network includes a senior member of staff from each department with a broad knowledge of the policy work undertaken by that department and its relevance to advancing the goals of equality and inclusion. </p><p>Members are accountable for:</p><p>1. ensuring that policy makers in their departments are fully aware of, and implementing, Equality Budgeting policy where applicable;</p><p>2. bringing all relevant work within their department to the attention of the Equality Budgeting unit, to ensure that strategic direction of Equality Budgeting is fully informed, and;</p><p>3. attending all scheduled meetings, or where this is not possible, nominate a suitably informed deputy to attend, to represent their department </p><p>This group is playing a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting.</p><p>By improving knowledge sharing across departments, this network will help to resolve several challenges highlighted by the OECD. The network will also facilitate cross-government training on the purpose and application of equality budgeting.  </p><p>In conjunction with the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory group, this network will also help inform the future direction of Equality Budgeting policy, in line with broader cross-governmental developments, including the Wellbeing framework.<b></b></p><p>The Network is chaired jointly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and meetings will continue to be held on approximately a bi-monthly basis.

With an initial focus on gender, due to the availability of data, Equality Budgeting has since been expanded across multiple dimensions of equality including gender, socio-economic, disability and minority groups.  </p>  <p>  An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group (EBEAG) has been established to guide the development of Equality Budgeting policy. Representing key stakeholders such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the National Women&rsquo;s Council and the National Disability Authority, this group is chaired by my Department and has met regularly since 2018.</p>  <p>  To drive this important work forward in line with international best practice, in 2019 the OECD was requested by my Department, and the Department of Justice and Equality, to conduct a scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. The report, published on Budget day 2020, supported the approach taken, and also provided twelve recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the report's recommendations is well advanced, is a continued focus of work, and includes the workstreams below.</p>  <p>  In cooperation with my Department, the CSO conducted a data audit in 2020 to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. This work was guided by the EBEAG and the audit findings were published alongside Budget 2021. The information is published on the CSO website and will continue to be updated as new data is identified.  </p>  <p>  Following the data audit, work is now underway to identify a data strategy that will identify what actions are needed to improve the disaggregation of data and identify actions needed to address data gaps. This work is led by the CSO and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDIY).  </p>  <p>  A key OECD recommendation, that has underpinned overall implementation, was the establishment of an inter-departmental network of Equality Budgeting contact points.  In March of this year, Government agreed to establish an inter-departmental network on Equality Budgeting in order to facilitate the full implementation of Equality Budgeting across all departments, in line with this OECD recommendation. The network first met in June, and have since met on two further dates in July and November.   The inter-departmental network includes a senior member of staff from each department and members are accountable for:</p>  <p>  - ensuring that policy makers in their departments are fully aware of, and implementing, Equality Budgeting policy where applicable and </p>  <p>  - bringing all relevant work within their department to the attention of the Equality Budgeting unit, to ensure that strategic direction of Equality Budgeting is fully informed. </p>  <p>  An initial multi-dimensional Well-being Framework for Ireland was published in July 2021.  Since then the CSO has launched an interactive dashboard to complement the Framework and a wide-ranging public consultation led by the Department of the Taoiseach is ongoing. My Department is in the process of piloting an approach of locating well-being within existing public policy. The approach builds on the performance budgeting initiative by placing an explicit focus on stated policy goals and evidence of progress. With regard to well-being, my Department intends to: </p>  <p>  (1)  Put in place supports for other Departments to support them in using the Well-being Framework as part of the Spending Review process; and</p>  <p>  (2)  Develop an approach to linking budget decisions with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework. </p>  <p>  The Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) is an EU programme that provides tailor-made support to all EU countries for their institutional, administrative and growth-enhancing reforms. In Oct 2019, my Department applied for funding to develop our Performance Budgeting framework and systems, and in early 2020, it was confirmed that our application had been successful. This project aims to create a new architecture for Performance Budgeting that brings together the various streams including Green Budgeting, Equality Budgeting, and Well-being Budgeting. A key element of this project is the development of tagging and tracking functions. </p>  <p>  We continue to work closely with the Department of Finance, who are also members of the EBEAG, to ensure synergy with their remit. On Budget day this year, the Department of Finance published a paper (as part of the Report on Tax Expenditures 2021), which examined how to analyse and develop a process for Equality Budgeting in Ireland from a tax perspective. </p>  <p>  We continue to work very closely with our colleagues in D/CEDIY to ensure that Equality Budgeting and gender mainstreaming work together to achieve common goals and on mutually beneficial policies. The Inter-departmental network outlined above is jointly chaired by D/CEDIY which ensures collaboration is maximised. </p>  <p>  Communication with stakeholders continues to be a priority. Through both the EBEAG and the Inter-departmental network, very strong communication channels now exist. These channels provide the scope to enhance knowledge sharing on Equality Budgeting across Government. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to identify the most suitable approach to track the actions and impact of equality budgeting to inform both the Oireachtas and civil society stakeholders that builds on the existing structures in place in the Revised Estimates for Public Services and the Public Service Performance Report.</p>  <p>  The actions outlined above, and the work plan in place for 2022, will continue to support the further development of Equality Budgeting, ensuring that the momentum achieved to date will be maintained. </p></reply>

With a view to giving effect to this commitment and the actions outlined in the PFG, a TCF Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) was established in November 2020 to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages. The IDG is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD).  The IDG has met five times since its inaugural meeting in November.  </p>  <p>  In parallel with the IDG, a Town Centre First Advisory Group was also established to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development, and to support the work of the IDG. The Group, which I chair, comprises individual representatives from a broad range of sectors to ensure effective and diverse representation with the capacity and experience to contribute in a meaningful way to the preparation and implementation of a practical TCF framework.  The work of the Advisory Group has been advanced primarily through written submissions and bi-lateral meetings with the Co-chairs of the IDG and also the chairs of three IDG working groups that were also established to further inform and underpin the work of the Advisory Group and the IDG.  </p>  <p>  Following the initial development stages through the forum of the IDG and Advisory Group, both my and Minister Humphrey's Departments have collaborated in progressing a draft policy. Following a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Group on November 22, 2021, this document is currently being finalised for publication. I expect the TCF policy to be brought to Cabinet in the coming weeks and to be announced prior to the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The HNDA is a standardised methodology which quantifies current and projected housing needs of local authority areas, including requirements for different tenures.</p>  <p>  Nationally, the proportion of households identified by the HNDA with &ldquo;affordability constraints&rdquo; is c.12.5% of total demand arising over the next five years. Not all local authority areas have such a high level of affordably constrained demand. In many areas, sufficient housing is available at prices new households can afford to pay and their HNDAs identify demand with an affordability constraint at a low level or at 0%. However, other local authority areas have significantly higher house prices and affordability constraints greater than 20% of total housing demand.

These revised Regulations included the addition of investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), as a permitted investment class for credit unions. Accordingly, since 1 March 2018, credit unions are permitted to provide funding, through a regulated investment vehicle, to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  </p>  <p>  In mid-September 2021, it was announced that two credit union backed funds had received regulatory approval from the Central Bank to lend to AHBs for the purposes of delivering social and affordable housing. These are the Credit Union Approved Housing Body Fund and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) backed Approved Housing Body Fund. </p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department referred the Credit Union representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes. The work of the ICSH was supported by grant funding from my Department. </p>  <p>  The ICSH, along with six Tier 3 AHBs, have worked with specialist financial advisors to establish a funding mechanism or vehicle which would identify suitable sources of non-state finance to fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs, based on best value for money. Market testing undertaken revealed good interest in lending to the AHB sector from various lenders including banks, institutional investors and the Credit Union sector. So far, one AHB has set up an SPV and several AHBs have sourced finance from private institutions. As such, the work in this area is ongoing and has led to individual AHBs establishing SPVs for financing social housing.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union sector is one potential funder whose terms are assessed as part of the process of market testing to establish best value for money and optimum terms and conditions from lenders.  While my Department will continue to be available to provide any clarifications that may be required in relation to the delivery of social and affordable housing, it falls to the relevant parties, i.e. the AHBs, on the one hand, and potential investors on the other, to agree a workable and mutually acceptable approach in order to bring potential investment possibilities to a successful conclusion.</p></reply>

The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p>  <p>   Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a Local Electoral Area (LEA) within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p>  <p>  The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows: </p>  <p>  the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash;  </p>  <p>   in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or  </p>  <p>   in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. </p>  <p>  Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a summary  table of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. </p>  <p>  The RTB Rent Index measures rent increases in LEAs using the 2019 boundaries for these LEAs and there is no specific measure to calculate rental increases broken down to any lower level (i.e. part of an LEA). </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA (in its entirety) in Galway or elsewhere meets the designation criteria, it will be designated as a RPZ. </p>  <p>  The solution to dealing with the rental market challenges is to provide for increased supply of homes. Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland does that through a range of interventions and unprecedented investment with in excess of &euro;20 billion in funding over the next five years.    </p></reply>

The Memorandum of Understanding between Irish Water and local authorities, as referenced in the question, is intended only to address the arrangements necessary for taking in charge of estates which are connected to the public (Irish Water) network. It does not address housing estates which rely on DPI which are a legacy issue.    </p>  <p>  In terms of reliance on DPI, experience has shown that this infrastructure is often temporary and is not properly maintained. This can lead to environmental and public health risk. Policy in the past had allowed for DPI as an interim solution which would become redundant or partly redundant when a public scheme was constructed. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently operating a multi-annual capital investment programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of housing estates with legacy DPI. However, significant challenges exist in realising solutions for all these problem areas. </p>  <p>  On 21 September 2020, I announced allocations under the new multi-annual capital investment programme - the Multi-annual Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme 2019-2021 - for the progressive resolution of DPI, to enable the taking in charge of these estates.  </p>  <p>  The focus of the first multi-annual programme is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the public networks. The programme will also support a number of pilot projects where connection is not feasible in the immediate future. These pilot projects, together with a major study currently being undertaken by Irish Water due for completion in Q2 2022 will inform future policy considerations on resolving sub-standard developer provided infrastructure with sustainable solutions.</p>  <p>  Under the approvals in September 2020, local authorities were also asked to examine further estates requiring funding for resolution within their functional areas. Arising from this process, valid bids for estates were received from a number of local authorities. I am awaiting a report from the Expert Panel following their evaluation of these further estates and the pilot projects to be submitted to me early 2022. </p>  <p>  The issue of updating the Memorandum of Understanding would be a matter for the parties concerned. However, the sustainable resolution of the infrastructure referred to needs to be dealt with before it can be handed over to Irish Water in the manner set out in the reply.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland was published in September 2021 and, among other things, commits to a review of income eligibility for social housing. The review is underway and is examining the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities and equivalisation as between singles and families, while also having regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental. I intend the review to be completed before the end of the year.</p></reply>

This meant that for eligible businesses their commercial rates were funded by Government for nine months of 2020.   </p>  <p>  &euro;435m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a rates waiver for Q1 to Q3 this year.  Administration of the waiver by local authorities is ongoing and local authorities are currently submitting returns for recoupment of the costs of the waiver to the Department.  These are unprecedented measures, which offered support to businesses and financial certainty to local authorities.   </p>  <p>  A more targeted rates waiver for Q4 2021 was announced in Budget 2022 to cover the hospitality, arts, leisure and entertainment sectors, travel agency and airports sector.  &euro;62.3m has been allocated by Government for this waiver.  The waiver is intended to assist specific sectors as they continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions beyond September 2021.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the hospitality and tourism sectors make a very significant contribution to local authority income through their commercial rates, and to local economies generally by enticing visitors, boosting walk-in trade for other businesses and providing employment.  It is also the case that the hospitality and tourism sectors are widely affected by current COVID-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  As with all public health measures and associated supports, the waiver of commercial rates will be kept under review.  As has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic. </p></reply>

My Department, however, offers a number of financial supports for owners of protected structures, which may be of interest to home buyers considering purchasing such a structure.</p><p>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective Records of Protected Structures (RPS). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.</p><p>To assist local authorities and owners in fulfilling their statutory obligations, the Act provides for me, with the consent of the Oireachtas, to make grants to the local authorities for the purpose of assisting owners in carrying out eligible conservation works to their properties. This is achieved through two grant schemes: the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS).</p><p>Under the 2021 HSF and BHIS 562 heritage projects across every county in the country were allocated funding from a combined sum of &euro;6m. I was delighted to launch the 2022 HSF and BHIS schemes recently with joint funding of &euro;8m. Applications for both schemes are now open and details of how to apply are available on my Department's website as well as on the websites of all local authorities. In line with our recently-published <i>Housing for All</i>, applications which seek to return historic structures to residential use will be particularly welcome.</p><p>The Historic Towns Initiative (HTI) may also be of interest; it is a joint undertaking between my Department and the Heritage Council, which aims to promote the heritage-led regeneration of Ireland&rsquo;s historic towns. This year &euro;1.5m was available under the HTI. By working in partnership with owners and local authorities, the 2021 HTI allowed heritage-led regeneration projects to take place in nine towns across the country. The 2022 HTI will be announced shortly. Again, in line with <i>Housing for All</i>commitments, the 2022 scheme will encourage private owners and/or occupiers to bring vacant floor area in historic buildings back into use.</p></reply>

Where the conditions and size thresholds specified in the exemption class are not complied with or are exceeded, planning permission is required.</p>  <p>  Exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of specific forms of development are provided for when they are considered to be consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are considered appropriate for the purpose of supporting the roll-out of a high quality communications service by a statutory undertaker while also taking account of the ongoing technological advances in this area. The legislative provisions are supplemented by planning guidelines entitled the Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structure Guidelines, which originally issued to planning authorities in 1996. In 2012, my Department issued Circular Letter PL07/12 to planning authorities, updating certain sections of these Guidelines. The Guidelines provide advice on appropriate location and siting considerations for telecommunication installations and masts to be considered in the development planning and development management process. The Guidelines, and subsequent Circular Letter, are available at the following links:</p>  <p>www.opr.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2012-Telecommunications-Antennae-and-Support-Structures-Circular-PL-07-12-1.pdf </p>  <p>  and</p>  <p>  www.assets.gov.ie/111242/904beafb-f8f4-4585-954f-c0753072e422.doc </p>  <p>  I have no current plans to amend the Regulations in this matter.</p></reply>

Also in partnership with Limerick City and County Council and other stakeholders, the LDA recently put a Draft Spatial Framework on public display in respect of the proposed regeneration of c.69 hectares of largely state owned land centred around Colbert station in Limerick. </p><p>A Cork Docklands Delivery Office was also established by Cork City Council in partnership with the LDA. The partnership will seek to promote a regeneration project of international scale and significance in Cork City. Cork City Docklands is Ireland&rsquo;s largest regeneration project with a total area of 146ha of land. The new office will lead the development of thousands of homes and the creation of a new urban centre for international investment into Cork City. </p><p>The Government's Housing for All Strategy identifies a further 20 sites, in addition to the LDA's initial sites, with the potential to yield up to 15,000 units over time. These lands will transfer to LDA ownership as soon as practicable. The LDA, in consultation with the relevant Department, will undertake the process of due diligence on these lands, which will determine the appropriate residential yield for each site and other issues arising such as relocation of services. </p><p>An early site to transfer under Housing for All is the properties held by the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) in the Liberties area of Dublin. The Government announced earlier this year that the properties held by the DHDA are to be transferred to the LDA in mid-2022. The LDA intends to prepare a plan for development on the site and will engage with the local community and other stakeholders on other potential civic and community uses in addition to housing.</p><p>Under Housing for All, the LDA will also be responsible for &lsquo;Project Tosaigh&rsquo;, a new strategy to unlock stalled or slow developments on non-state lands. As part of this plan, the LDA will be tasked with intervening in slow or stalled developments, through an open and transparent process, designed to ascertain the potential for it to enter into strategic partnerships with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate delivery. It is estimated that this plan could deliver up to 5,000 new affordable homes on such lands that otherwise would not have been delivered, or would be delivered much more slowly. An initial call for expressions of interest has now been opened by the LDA and is set to run until early December. </p><p>Under the LDA Act, there is a minimum 50% affordable housing delivery requirement for those relevant public lands which are subject to Part 9 of the Act, with a minimum of 80% affordable housing on relevant public lands in urban areas with a population greater than 150,000, that is Dublin and Cork cities. This will be in addition to the increased 20% Part V social and affordable housing obligation being introduced under the Affordable Housing Act which will ensure that there will be 100% affordable and social housing on such lands in our largest cities.</p><p>Completion dates will also be dependent on the finalisation of plans and planning permission being sought as many of the sites will be phased over years due to size and scale of the developments.</p></reply>

However, at the request of Ireland, France and Estonia, the three EU members of the UN Security Council, the Council held an AOB discussion on Belarus on 11 November, focused on the ongoing migration issue there. Ireland expressed concern about the deteriorating situation at the EU-Belarus border, condemned the instrumentalisation of migrants for political purposes by the Belarusian authorities, and highlighted the need to prevent a humanitarian crisis unfolding.   </p>  <p>  The EU members of the Council, joined by Norway, the UK, and the US, as well as incoming Council member Albania, held a press stakeout after the meeting, stressing that all actions must be guided by fundamental values, especially regarding the protection of migrants&rsquo; human rights.  </p></reply>

Ireland and the EU had stated on numerous occasions that these elections were going to be neither free nor fair, and that proved to be the case. No credible opposition figures were allowed to run, and no election monitoring was permitted.</p>  <p>  In the months leading up to the elections, we had seen a severe crackdown on journalists, opposition politicians, human rights activists, civil society and business leaders in Nicaragua. This repression deprived Nicaraguan citizens of their human, civil and political rights, and of the right to elect their own government in fair and transparent elections.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have expressed our serious concern in relation to the situation in Nicaragua, have unequivocally condemned the actions of the Nicaraguan authorities, and have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of all opposition politicians and all other political prisoners. We have also called for the authorities to allow the return of international human rights bodies and NGOs to the country.</p>  <p>  We will continue to put pressure on the Nicaraguan authorities to put an end to the crackdown and to restore full respect for human rights and democracy in the country.</p>  <p>  Just like multiple other countries and multilateral bodies, the EU released a very strong statement on 8 November condemning the elections and stating that the presidency of Daniel Ortega lacks democratic legitimacy. The Nicaraguan government was left in no doubt that its actions are unacceptable to all EU Member States, including Ireland. That statement also noted that the EU will consider further restrictive measures against the regime. </p>  <p>  The next steps in terms of EU action on Nicaragua are currently being discussed among EU Member States in Brussels. The EU and Ireland have also been very clear that any further action must not add to the hardship of the population, and that the most vulnerable sectors of society must continue to be supported.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely engage at EU and international level, both through our Embassy in Mexico which covers relations with Nicaragua and through our partners on the ground, including NGO and civil society organisations, to find a solution to the crisis. </p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, the Passport Service has issued over half a million passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business day. </p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provided all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific information requested by the Deputy, the Passport Service systems do not currently allow us to provide this level of detail.  This is because elements of an application are reset when documentation which was incorrect or not submitted with the application are requested and subsequently received. However, the deputy can be assured that the Passport Service is attaching particular priority to the nearly 7% of online applications which have not been issued on or before estimated issue date which was indicated to the applicant. Intensive work is underway to eliminate these delays which are very much regretted by the Service.</p>  <p>  Most recent Passport Service figures show that 35% of online applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. The Passport Service contacts applicants who have not submitted the requisite documentation. However, the Passport Service must wait in those cases until the applicants submit the outstanding documentation that is required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of applicants. </p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications processing time is 40 working days.</p>  <p>  Resourcing the Passport Service is of the highest priority for my Department who are actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit both permanent and temporary staff between now and the end of January 2022.  This will double the number of staff from June levels to a total of 920 staff by the end of January. I am confident that these additional resources will help to improve customer experience and reduce turnaround times. to respond to current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. These improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Verification of consent of all guardians is vital to protecting the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and its guardians. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy is enquiring, this application was submitted shortly before Passport Service operations were disrupted by necessary public health restrictions. Once operations scaled up again in line with easing of public health restrictions, the Passport Service made multiple attempts to verify the consent of the applicant's parent who was resident overseas. Unfortunately, staff were unable to verify the consent of the overseas parent in this case and the passport application had come to the point where it had expired. I encourage the applicant's parent to apply for their child's passport again, once all supporting documents and consent forms are fully complete and verifiable. </p></reply>

The independent report which was produced, and to which the Deputy refers, considered the Defence Forces health and safety regime, its current policy and its application and made a number of observations including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure to monitoring. The report was published on the Department's website following its circulation to those who made disclosures and is therefore available to the agencies referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that separately from the independent review, following three inspections at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel during 2016, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) issued a Report of Inspection to the Air Corps on 21 October, 2016.  This report listed a number of advisory items for follow up, including the areas of risk assessments, safety statements and the provision and use of personal protective equipment.  </p>  <p>  The resultant Air Corps improvement plan confirmed the Air Corps' full commitment to implementing improved safety measures that protect workers and ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps improvement plan was implemented over eight phases,  which the military authorities have advised are now complete, with phase eight, chemical awareness training and respiratory equipment training, being a continuous process.  </p>  <p>  The HSA has formally noted the high level of cooperation received and the considerable progress made to date by the Air Corps in this regard and their investigation is now closed.   </p>  <p>  A wide range of other measures are  in place to ensure the health and safety of those serving in the Air Corps including monitoring exposure levels, conducting annual occupational medical screening, audits and training. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps and the wider Defence organisation is committed to complying with health and safety legislation.  The organisation is proactive in ensuring that the best standards are adhered to in order to ensure that the risk to human health is as low as reasonably practicable. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that  as litigation is on-going, managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of my Department, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  </p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms, and barracks infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The current AW139&rsquo;s were brought into service in 2006 and have a planned service life of approx 20 years.  There are no plans to change the AW139 fleet in 2022. The future maintenance and development of the Air Corps fleet will be considered as part of the Equipment Development Plan review process. </p>  <p>  The Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020, with a mandate to report within 12 months. The work of the Commission encompasses  the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards, to enable them to meet operational requirements.</p></reply>

These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are very effective to help prevent and control COVID-19 in schools. The vast majority of teachers and staff have now been vaccinated. The very high rates of take up of the vaccines across society has been encouraging and reassuring. My Department will continue to work closely with public health officials and the education stakeholders in respect of the safe operation of schools during COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The most up to date guidance for pregnant teachers and special needs assistants in the education sector was published by the HSE in July 2021 and authored by the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Public Health Medicine in HSE and Medmark Occupational Healthcare.</p>  <p>  As with all other guidelines around public health measures, my Department has been led by expert medical advice provided by the Government through the HSE and other relevant public bodies. In the particular case of advice around pregnant employees, this advice was prepared in consultation with the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the national professional and training body for Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Ireland, as well as other medical and public health professionals.</p>  <p>  The HSE guidance for the education sector confirm that pregnant teachers and special needs assistants can safely attend the workplace in school where all the infection prevention and control measures are in place by implementation of the School COVID-19 Response Plan. This is the case whether or not the pregnant teacher or special needs assistant has been vaccinated. </p>  <p>  However, all employees should apply to the Occupational Health Service (OHS) before the end of their first trimester, so that their individual medical circumstances can be assessed in the context of COVID-19. Those with underlying medical conditions may be categorised as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; and be facilitated to work remotely i.e. work from home.  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of employees, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process.  </p>  <p>  It is of course open to a teacher or special needs assistant to discuss their individual medical concerns with their own medical team.  Where their treating consultant has concerns over their fitness to work due to a pregnancy-related illness, then the terms and conditions of the Sick Leave Scheme (pregnancy related illness provisions) may apply, outside of the very specific COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment by the OHS referred to above.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and special needs assistants employed in recognised primary and post primary schools.</p></reply>

In the 2020/2021 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability. </p>  <p>  In general, children with special educational needs are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest school that is resourced to meet their special educational needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENO).  </p>  <p>  When applications are approved by the Department of Education, Bus &Eacute;ireann assesses the transport options available, taking into account the individual requirements of each child. Where children can be facilitated on an existing service, applications are processed as soon as possible and arrangements put in place with the families involved.</p>  <p>  My Department can confirm that it has recently received 26 transport applications for pupils attending the school in question. All parties involved are working together to process these applications as speedily as possible with a view to providing the new services to the families concerned in the shortest possible timeframe. </p>  <p>  My Department has to date sanctioned transport for 25 pupils involving a number of new SEN services. These services are currently being tendered by Bus &Eacute;ireann  in line with the procurement process.  A Special Transport Grant has been offered to the family of the remaining pupil. </p>  <p>  Both the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the challenges faced by parents awaiting transport for students with special educational needs. Families of children who are eligible for special educational needs school transport may therefore avail of the Special Transport Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements until services are finalised. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  The organisation's claim in relation to raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications have impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since the minimum qualifications were set, the Department has indicated to the organisation that it is open to reviewing the position. The Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p></reply>

Social, Personal and Health Education is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. RSE is required at all levels, from Primary through to Senior Cycle. The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the primary level SPHE curriculum is to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help them to create and maintain supportive relationships and to enable children make safe and healthy decisions now and in the future.   </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act, 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of classes which are contrary to the conscience of the parent if they so wish. It is expected that this right be upheld by schools on foot of a parental request. The school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p></reply>

Hours accumulated in any given school year must be utilised in the same school year.  </p>  <p>  Where hours were accumulated due to a school receiving a backdated increase to their Special Education Teaching hours, or due to a Special Education Teacher being used to cover substitution, as an emergency measure, schools were advised that any loss of special education teaching time should be made up at the first available opportunity by employing additional teaching resources to make up for the shortfall.</p>  <p>  DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools are being updated from September 2019.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p>  <p>  Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p>  <p>  Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Primary-Schools-Review-Application-2020.doc.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position.

Under the terms of the standard employment contract agreed in 2005, SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term, not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement, it was agreed to convert that requirement to one of 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs), for use by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. These arrangements were notified to schools in 2011, in Department Circular 0071/2011. The duties listed in that Circular form part of the normal range of SNA duties, and are therefore liable to be performed at any time during normal working hours, including during the 72 hours.  The agreed uses of the 72 hours include: </p>  <p>  - SEN pupil-centred activity - such as assistance with care planning;</p>  <p>  - Learning resource administration &ndash; such as preparing class rooms and materials;</p>  <p>  - Class and school planning and development;</p>  <p>  - Assistance with special exam centres for the State exams; and</p>  <p>  - Training</p>  <p>  The description of these hours in some commentary as &lsquo;unpaid&rsquo; is erroneous: remuneration for the 12 days or 72 hours is included as part of the normal salary paid to an SNA under the terms of the 2005 agreed contract.  </p>  <p>  An important reminder of the requirement to effectively manage, communicate and record this element of the SNA contract issued from my Department in November 2020, to ensure that schools effectively plan for the optimum use of this time to support the care needs of pupils. The 72 hours allow for very important support work to be carried out without reducing the SNA&rsquo;s time with the pupil(s) in need of their care. Accordingly, the suspension of the requirement to complete the 72 hours would have a direct, negative impact on pupils with special educational needs as it would impede on normal class time.  </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa, the trade union which represents SNAs, has formally sought abolition of the 72 hours contractual requirement through industrial relations channels. I understand that the claim is currently paused so that a review of the SNA contract, proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement, can be carried out and implemented first.   As the 72 hour requirement is an integral part of the current SNA contract, the review process may address the concerns that F&oacute;rsa have in relation to that aspect of the contract.  If those concerns are not addressed through the review process, my Department remains open to progressing the matter through the normal industrial relations channels.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Since the commencement of the 2020/2021 school year schools do not apply for SNA access for individual students. School have maintained their previous school year&rsquo;s mainstream SNA allocation.  Where a school believes they have identified insufficient SNA support to respond to an increase in the care needs profile of the school, they can apply for an exceptional review. </p><p>The SNA exceptional review considers the overall profile of needs in the school and is not specific to individual students. Students are no longer required to have a diagnosis or supporting clinical reports in order to access supports.</p><p>Decisions regarding the appropriate deployment of SNA supports are made by school management.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website, www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p></reply>

The Council reviews and accredits programmes provided by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the State, based on those standards. All programmes of ITE (primary, post-primary and further education) in Ireland that lead to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council. The standards for programmes of ITE have recently been revised and were published in C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education (2020) in October 2020. </p><p>Teachers who hold recognised Special Education Teaching qualifications obtained outside the State may continue to apply for registration with the Council under Route 4 and there is no intention to close-off this provision. </p><p>The standards stipulate that all programmes of ITE shall enable newly qualified teachers to facilitate quality teaching and learning for <b>all</b>pupils and sets Inclusive Education as one of the seven core elements which must unpin all aspects of the programme of ITE. The following excerpts from C&eacute;im are relevant in the context of inclusive education. </p><p>- The term inclusive education has been defined as &lsquo;any aspect of teachers&rsquo; learning aimed at improving their capacity to address and respond to the diversity of learners&rsquo; needs; to enable their participation in learning; and remove barriers to education through the accommodation and provision of appropriate structures and arrangements to enable each learner to achieve the maximum benefit from his/her attendance at school.&rsquo;  </p><p>- Furthermore, it references that &lsquo;the Council&rsquo;s view of a truly inclusive approach to professional practice recognises that teachers encounter a diverse range of needs in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting. This will include additional learning needs (e.g. autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia) and learning needs associated with diverse linguistic, socioeconomic, cultural and ethnic (including Traveller community, Roma) backgrounds.&rsquo; </p><p>- In the programme aims it is specified that &lsquo;programmes shall enable newly qualified teachers to facilitate quality teaching and learning for <b>all</b>pupils and in the context of curriculum development to include the learning outcomes based curricula and national priorities.&rsquo;</p><p>- One of the seven Core Elements for all programmes of initial teacher education is Inclusive Education.</p><p>- <b>Inclusive Education:</b>With reference to Inclusive Education as outlined in the Glossary, to include the fostering of appropriate learning environments that support the development of student teachers&rsquo; ability to provide for the learning needs of all pupils by utilising, for example, a universal design for learning framework. </p><p>In relation to school placement, the standards provide for a diversity of placement settings setting out that school placement shall comprise a minimum of two placement settings incorporating a variety of teaching situations, class levels and school contexts. C&eacute;im also sets out that during every module of school placement, student teachers, through the use of their Taisce, must demonstrate their understanding of Inclusive Education, as applicable to that context. </p></reply>

The guidelines also refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. </p>  <p>  The publication provides practical step-by-step guidelines for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. It offers support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time. The guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines "Responding to Critical Incidents: NEPS Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools&rsquo; are kept under constant review and a third edition was circulated by NEPS to schools in 2016. Training in critical incident planning is part of the service provided by NEPS to schools and has been a focus of my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education since 2016. In order to increase the reach of Critical Incident training to all schools, NEPS has developed an eLearning course Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools &ndash; eLearning Course&rsquo; to accompany "Responding to Critical Incidents: NEPS Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools&rsquo;. It is expected that this will be available in Q1 2022. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions in this regard, critical incidents are by their nature situations so named by schools themselves &ndash; traumatic events which have the potential to disrupt the normal operation of the school.  In such instances, when a school deems itself to have experienced a critical incident, a school&rsquo;s Critical incident policy and plan is activated.</p>  <p>  Depending upon the nature, severity or context of an event, schools may respond to a critical incident independently of NEPS support. On other occasions they may initiate contact with NEPS to seek advice or confirmation as to how they should proceed in relation to a particular event or part of the process. In many situations school authorities are satisfied to proceed with a response without further input from NEPS.  In other situations, school authorities may request the attendance of NEPS psychologists on-site to provide appropriate advice and assistance in the delivery of the response. When requested, NEPS will attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff in managing the situation. The nature and extent of the incident, as well as a school&rsquo;s capacity to respond will determine the degree of ongoing support required of NEPS.</p>  <p>  In terms of the number of critical incidents, 1557 critical incident responses were provided in schools by NEPS psychologists between September 2009 - 2021.</p></reply>

As set out in the accompanying Implementation Plan, four new leaving certificate curricular languages were introduced from September 2020 &ndash; Mandarin Chinese, Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese.  These new languages will be examined for the first time in summer 2022.</p>  <p>  As also set out in the implementation plan, Action 2.E.11. states that &ldquo;Following a review of newly introduced heritage language Leaving Certificate examinations in Polish, Portuguese and Lithuanian, consideration will be given to the inclusion of other existing non-curricular languages as heritage languages within the Leaving Certificate&rdquo; from Quarter 4 of 2022.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) are providing support classes in Dublin on Saturdays with students of Romanian heritage taking the non-curricular examination of Romanian at Leaving Certificate level.  Fifty-one students are enrolled in these classes for the current academic year and efforts are being made to establish a second class in Cork.   Funding has been provided for the current academic year to two schools in Dublin where there are significant numbers of students sitting the Leaving Certificate examination. PPLI are also working on the development of resources to support the teaching and learning of Romanian.</p>  <p>  PPLI have also been funding summer camps for senior cycle students in Dublin and Cork to encourage them to think about taking Romanian for Leaving Certificate and to facilitate them in meeting peers from a similar background and appreciating the value of their heritage language and culture. </p>  <p>  In primary and special schools, the Primary Language Curriculum (PLC), introduced in 2019, responds to the significant societal changes including greater diversity in our classrooms that have emerged in recent decades. The curriculum emphasises the importance of appreciating and nurturing children's home languages within the school environment, which includes the Romanian language for children from that linguistic background. </p>  <p>  Languages Connect also asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to consider the inclusion of Foreign Languages in the Primary School Curriculum. In response the draft Primary Curriculum Framework includes a proposal to introduce a foreign language for stages 3 and 4 (third to sixth class). This proposal, along with others related to the redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum, is currently being consulted upon.  In the meantime, I have introduced a language sampler module for primary schools.  Approximately 500 schools right across the country have expressed an interest in participating in this six-week module selecting 10 languages including Irish Sign Language.  The module is rolling out in three phases, the first 165 schools commenced the module in November and the remaining schools will roll out in phase two in February 2022 and phase three in May 2022.   Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) have been charged by the Department with managing this programme and they have provided Continuing Professional Development to the participating teachers and tutors and to the hosting teachers.  They have also provided the schools with a range of exciting and engaging resources which are also available on-line on the Languages Connect website, languagesconnect.ie/primary/.  Schools have been provided with a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to fund implementation of the module.  One school has selected to participate in the primary module using Romanian.</p>  <p>  The learning from this sampler module will help inform the ongoing thinking in relation to the proposed inclusion of languages in the redeveloped Primary School Curriculum. </p></reply>

It is chaired jointly by my Department and the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service. </p>  <p>  On 30 June 2021, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations.  Details of these adjustments were issued to schools on 19 August 2021 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes.  These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by these students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I consider that these arrangements are proportionate to the students&rsquo; experience and loss of learning, and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students.  The level of adjustment will be similar to that applied by the Assessment Arrangements For Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the adjustments for the 2022 examinations, I also announced that an alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations would be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  These  examinations will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement and certain categories of serious illness to be determined, with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the examinations system.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations, guided by prevailing public health advice. There will continue to be engagement with stakeholders, including through the Advisory Group on Planning for the State Examinations,  in the context of the 2022 examinations.</p></reply>

The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p>  <p>  A school may, however, seek payment to cover the cost of photocopying or other such learning materials where the amount sought by the school is consistent with the costs involved and the level of materials provided. It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.</p>  <p>  Should a parent have a difficulty in paying for learning materials, they should contact the school in the first instance to request a breakdown of the fees as to whether they are mandatory or elective fees and whether there is any element of voluntary contribution included. They may also wish to discuss whether the school will consider a reduction for families with more than one child and whether there is any other method of payment e.g. instalments in place. No pupil should be disadvantaged in their learning due to the non-payment of fees.</p>  <p>  The Department is also continuing to progress the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill has been passed by the Seanad and last July passed second stage in the D&aacute;il. The overall aim of the Bill is to improve the level of engagement between the school community by inviting feedback, comment and observation from students and parents and by further developing a listening culture in schools. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities.</p>  <p>  This approach will help ensure that the various views of students and parents will be heard and responded to by schools on policies and issues including school costs.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs. The policy advice was considered by the Department and it was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p></reply>

The Scheme, which was developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, provides for ex gratia payments to be made to those who qualify to apply for the Scheme and who satisfy the criteria as set out in the Terms of Scheme.  To qualify for a payment, an applicant must demonstrate that the facts of their case come within the parameters of the ECtHR judgment and, in particular, will have to satisfy the following criteria &ndash;</p>  <p>  - Were sexually abused while a pupil at a recognised day school and that this occurred before November 1991 in respect of a primary school or June 1992 in respect of a post-primary school.</p>  <p>  - That had the Guidelines for Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse, Department of Education 1991/1992 been in place at the time the sexual abuse occurred there would have been a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm suffered as a result.</p>  <p>  Under the Terms of Scheme, a recognised school is defined as a school that is recognised under section 10 of the Education Act 1998, as amended. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to fulfilling its obligations in implementing the ECtHR ruling.  This means that the revised scheme is designed first and foremost to provide a remedy to those who had issued and discontinued their proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse prior to the ECtHR ruling in O'Keeffe v Ireland and who did not receive a payment under the 2015 Scheme.  However, the revised scheme goes beyond that group in that all others who issued legal proceedings against the State at a later date and up to 1 July 2021 in respect of day school sexual abuse, whether these proceedings are still in being, were discontinued at any point, or who had settled with the State, may also apply for an award.</p>  <p>  As well as broadening the scope of the Scheme, the type and nature of evidence that will be considered by the State Claims Agency in respect of individual applications (and as set out in the Terms of Scheme) broadens the means through which an applicant can demonstrate that they fall within the terms of the ECtHR judgment. </p>  <p>  Full details in respect of the Scheme are available on www.gov.ie/en/service/90a42-revised-ex-gratia-scheme/.

Co-educational schools provide greater flexibility than single sex schools in terms of meeting demographic and school accommodation requirements in an area. Single-gender provision may, however, be made if there is an identified imbalance between the capacities of single-gender schools in the area.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in the school planning areas within Dublin 9 and 11, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are very effective.</p>  <p>  Public Health continue to advise that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 (and other respiratory viruses), is by ensuring no-one with new onset  symptoms attend school, and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.  </p>  <p>  Each school was provided with an updated COVID-19 Response Plan in advance of the return to school.  Significant additional resources of &euro;639m were put into schools in the last academic year to keep schools safe.  </p>  <p>  Further funding of &euro;57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. </p>  <p>  At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for Principals and Deputy Principals. Teacher Supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, and a recent review saw a further additional 200 teaching posts added resulting in approximately 680 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools </p>  <p>  At post primary level over 1000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements in order to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students and ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. </p>  <p>Managing ventilation is also an important part of the measures to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre last Thursday.    CO2 monitors were also provided to schools to assist with managing ventilation locally.</p>  <p>  All of these measures are remaining in place for this school year. The infection prevention and control measures in place in schools have worked very effectively to prevent and control Covid-19 in schools.  The Department will continue to work closely with public health officials and the education stakeholders in respect of the safe operation of schools during Covid-19. Where a school is experiencing issues with ventilation, they should contact the Department.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education also recently announced a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises.  </p>  <p>  Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod in a seven day period, antigen tests will be offered to every child in the class. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.  </p>  <p>  NPHET has recommended and the Government has approved a measure introducing the wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in 3rd class and above in primary schools.  HSPC interim Guidance on the use of face coverings in childcare and educational setting can be found at this link www.gov.ie/en/publication/1f9ba-interim-guidance-on-the-use-of-face-coverings-in-childcare-and-educational-settings/.</p>  <p>  The Department has provided guidance for schools, including information on those categories of children who are exempt on medical grounds from wearing face masks. The measure is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre last Thursday November 18<sup>th</sup>. </p><p>The Expert Group note in its own report notes &ldquo;very good advice is contained in the Department of Education s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools&rdquo;</p><p>The over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use.  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms during periods of colder weather.</p><p>Deployment of the above measures can be supplemented and enhanced by the use of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors. These monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/  rooms may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with  the impact of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation within a room. </p><p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. </p><p>The Department considers the above practical steps and stepwise approach are sufficient to ensure good ventilation practices in school while at the same time ensuring an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  </p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in the Lucan area, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train.  </p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in Lucan, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>A number of projects to deliver additional post primary school capacity in the Lucan area are planned or underway including the following:</p><p>St Joseph's College - Roll number 60263V - Project at stage 3 to cater for 1000 pupils &ndash; Interim accommodation approved in October 2021 for 6 additional Classrooms </p><p>Griffeen Community College - Roll Number 76454S - New school to cater for 1000 pupils and 4 Class SEN Base  - Project at Architectural design stage.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that as of  29/11/2021 a total of 212 schools have applied for additional monitors. Of these 179 schools have been approved for 1136 additional monitors. These have been dispatched or are in the process of being dispatched by Lennox Laboratories.</p><p>A further 31 applications have been approved for an additional 196 monitors. These schools are  being notified of their approval for additional monitors.  A request for dispatch of these monitors will be sent to Lennox shortly.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,012,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p><p>I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland.  I intend to meet with representatives to discuss their proposal in detail and will ask officials in my Department to examine the matter. </p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.</p><p>It is also important to note that there are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act. </p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <b></b></p></reply>

Department officials also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p><p>At the start of April this year, agreement was reached between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Social Protection on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue.  These proposals included a financial package.</p><p>Since that time, discussions on these proposals took place between my Department and the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments; the Department of Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance.  </p><p>Department officials wrote to both SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa recently setting out the terms of a full and final settlement which will involve a once off ex-gratia payment to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors on reaching pension age.  The total value of the financial package now on the table is in excess of &euro;24 million.  </p><p>The scheme will apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors who have retired since 2008, subject to qualifying criteria, and has the potential to benefit up to 2,200 existing and former CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors. </p><p>This proposal is currently under consideration by the representative unions.  As such it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time. </p></reply>

She was notified of the decision and the overpayment amount in November 2006.</p>  <p>  The Department has already reviewed this matter as a result of an earlier PQ (reference 52235/2017) and on foot of an assertion from the person concerned that she did not receive these payments. The payments issued to the same Post Office as other earlier child benefit payments made to the same person, and Social Welfare payments made at Post Offices must be collected in person by the customer (who must have ID, or otherwise be known to the Post Office, at the time.).  As a result, the Department is satisfied that the payments were made to the correct customer and the overpayment decision remains valid.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As requested in one of the recommendations of the report, I will respond formally to the report in due course once I have had the opportunity to fully reflect upon it. </p>  <p>  I appreciate the Joint Committee's strong interest in employment services and their engagement with both myself and my officials as they considered their findings. However, I note that there are some inaccuracies in the report, where evidence from other witnesses to the Committee are repeated and are not factually accurate. One such example is the suggestion that my Department had not engaged with SIPTU prior to the 17th September 2021. My Department first met with SIPTU on this issue in 2019 and have had other meetings in advance of the 17th September 2021. </p>  <p>  I look forward to responding to the Joint Committee in detail on their recommendations.  It is clear we are all seeking to provide the best route to employment for those people who face serious and continuing challenges to returning to the labour market. </p>  <p>  However, given the need to expand employment service provision across the State, to strengthen governance in the delivery of employment service provision and to ensure that such provision is placed on a sound legal-footing, thereby meeting the State's legal obligations, my Department must procure employment services provision in an open and competitive manner.    </p></reply>

This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of similar employment services across the State.</p>  <p>  The Phase Two procurement, which will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State will take on board the learnings of the first phase. </p>  <p>  This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service partners and employee representatives over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy in regards to he complexity of the issues involved in getting persons into the workforce. These new employment service models are part of the creation of a coherent client journey whereby the client receives the right service at the right time in their efforts to return to the labour market. </p>  <p>  The Regional Employment Service is specifically designed for clients farthest from the labour market and its request for tender has been designed accordingly with a strong emphasis on the quality of service, inviting tenderers to demonstrate their ability to engage with these clients.   </p>  <p>  This is why the RES model requires tenderers not to bid below a certain threshold.   The Department believes it is necessary to provide a high quality service and this is why approximately ninety per cent of average fees will be paid for client commencement and personal progression and are unrelated to an employment outcome.  </p>  <p>  While recognising the challenges of engaging with clients farthest from the labour market, best practices in this area require the measurement of progress and an employment service ultimately measures its progress by the numbers who secure employment. The Regional Employment Service will therefore measure progression into employment but will also measure other key performance indicators. </p></reply>

When the Interim TCA was introduced, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid reckonable social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension payment where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  From April 2019, all new State Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including both the Interim TCA and the Yearly Average approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  </p>  <p>  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and to the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I understand that both the Chair of the Commission, Ms. Josephine Feehily and the Chair of its Technical Sub-Committee, Ms. Roma Burke met with the Joint Committee on 17th November 2021.  Officials from my Department also attended this meeting. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials will work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations.  The Commission's recommendations includes a full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model and phasing out of the Yearly Average approach over a 10 year timeframe.  In terms of the specific design of TCA, the Pensions Commission recommended that the current Interim TCA model should become the definitive TCA.  My officials will also consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system in relation to this.  </p>  <p>  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In October 2021, some 154,000 people were in receipt of Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  DA is payable to persons aged between 16 and 66, subject to a means test, a habitual residency requirement and a medical assessment. Medical assessment is essential in order to determine medical eligibility for the scheme. To be eligible, a person must have an injury, disease or mental or physical disability that has continued, or may be expected to continue for at least one year and, as a result of this disability, the person is &lsquo;substantially restricted&rsquo; in undertaking employment.  Medical eligibility for DA is assessed on a case by case basis and is determined by its severity, and resultant effects on activities of daily living and work-related activities. Eligibility is not based solely on diagnosis or treatment but rather is assessing the person&rsquo;s eligibility for the relevant scheme in accordance with the relevant statutory conditions.</p>  <p>  In addition to income supports, my Department provides a wide range of employment supports and services to assist jobseekers/existing employees with disabilities, and also employers seeking to hire a jobseeker (or support an existing employee) with a disability. </p>  <p>  The Department manages the State&rsquo;s Public Employment Service (PES) through its nationwide network of Intreo centres and contractors delivering services on its behalf, for example, Local Employment (LES) and Employability. The employment supports and services have been designed to focus on supporting the individual jobseeker, rather than being focused on their disability, to best assist them to obtain and maintain employment. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers, including Jobseekers with a disability, who seek support from their local Intreo office or LES centre work with a case officer/mediator with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available. These offices also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.</p>  <p>  EmployAbility is a referral only service that is designed to address the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment. The Department contracts with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations. A jobseeker may be referred to an EmployAbility service provider if it is agreed between the jobseeker and their Intreo Case Officer/LES Mediator. Providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities. Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance. Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.</p>  <p>  The Department provides specific support for graduate jobseekers with disabilities through AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability), a contracted service provider. They deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on behalf of the Department that provides paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities who want to enter or re-enter the job market.</p>  <p>  Schemes and supports that are available through local Intreo centres that jobseekers/employees with disabilities or their employers may be eligible to participate in or avail of include the Rural Social Scheme, the Community Employment Scheme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme for people with disabilities and the Reasonable Accommodation Fund Grants. </p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives. As set out above, a comprehensive set of income and employment supports is in place for those experiencing illness and disability, based on a person&rsquo;s medical condition and either their social insurance contributions or means testing.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.</p>  <p>  The State Pension Contributory (SPC) is a contributory payment and, as such, is not means tested. A recipient of the SPC can claim an increase to their pension in respect of a qualified adult (IQA).  A qualified adult is the spouse / partner of the pensioner who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the pensioner. </p>  <p>  An increase for a qualified adult may be payable at the maximum rate of payment where the means of the spouse/partner are &euro;100 a week or less, while reduced rates are payable where the means are over &euro;100 and less than &euro;310 per week.  No increase is payable where the means of the spouse/partner are in excess of &euro;310 per week. </p>  <p>  The State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) is a means-tested payment for people aged 66 or over who do not qualify for the SPC based on their social insurance record.</p>  <p>  As such, all recipients of the SPNC are subject to a means test. Social welfare legislation provides that all income and capital belonging to an applicant (and his or her spouse/partner, where applicable) is assessable for means testing purposes for social assistance schemes, such as the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC).  This includes all income and property (other than the family home) belonging to the claimant. </p>  <p>  To calculate the rate payable, the means of the claimant is deducted from the maximum rate of SPNC. In cases where the means of the claimant exceed the maximum rate, the claimant is not entitled to any payment.</p>  <p>  SPNC recipients can earn up to &euro;200 per week from employment without their rate of payment being affected. In addition, the first &euro;30 of means from any source is also disregarded.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue..</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>According to CSO figures, the rate of supplementary pension coverage is around 55% of the working population (Pension Coverage Survey 2020).  It is estimated that this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  As a consequence of this low supplementary pension coverage rate, many retirees may suffer an unwanted reduction in living standards when they retire.</p><p>This Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under as a result of the COVID-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles:</p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers.</p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions.</p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.</p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.</p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p><p>My Department is currently working on finalising a proposal for Government on the overall design of the AE system.  As set out in the Economic Recovery Plan 2021, it is hoped that the design can be completed by the end of this year.  Thereafter, it is intended that the necessary legislative, organisational and process structures will follow over the course of 2022 and 2023. </p><p>In progressing this work, the Department is receiving technical support from the European Commission&rsquo;s DG Reform which assists EU member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible, and so it is focussed on long term payments where an applicant satisfies a means test.  People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  It is for this reason that the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources such as Fuel Allowance to help this cohort of claimants.</p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly, tax-free payment available to employees with children. It gives extra financial support to families with children with rates depending on their incomes and family size.  It is not considered a long-term Social Protection payment and recipients are in full time employment and are more likely to have additional resources.  A person in receipt of the WFP can continue to receive the payment for 52 weeks even if their income increases. </p>  <p>  Any decision to include WFP as a qualifying payment for fuel allowance would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

The person concerned was born in 1959.</p>  <p>  Under current eligibility conditions, an individual must have 520 full-rate paid contributions in order to qualify for standard State pension (contributory).  520 full-rate contributions equate to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment. </p>  <p>  Factors such as an individual&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment affect the rate of pension entitlement.  Self-employed contributors shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) unless and until all outstanding self-employment contributions are paid.  </p>  <p>  A person employed in the public sector as a permanent member of staff prior to the 6th of April 1995 would have paid a modified or reduced rate of PRSI. This reduced PRSI rate conveys entitlement only to Widow (er)'s and Orphan's Contributory Pensions and limited Occupational Injuries Benefits but is not reckonable for State pension (contributory) purposes, therefore cannot be included in the calculation of a standard State pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  However, modified contributions can be combined with full-rate contributions and credits to give an entitlement to a mixed insurance pro rata State pension (contributory).

The aim of the strategy is to assist people back to work as the economy and labour market recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as supporting those who were unemployed pre-pandemic.  Included in the strategy are 3,000 additional placement opportunities for the employment support schemes.</p>  <p>  Following a call for expressions of interest from existing CE and T&uacute;s schemes earlier this year the Department received a broad range of applications from CE sponsoring authorities and T&uacute;s implementing bodies. Each application submitted was for a very specific role with related responsibilities and was evaluated and scored based on the data provided. Over 2,600 additional placements have been assigned to individual schemes to date; 1,475 additional placement opportunities have been assigned to CE schemes and 1,164 to T&uacute;s.  </p>  <p>  New places were approved and assigned based on applications by CE schemes,  based on the original role applied for by schemes which were assessed against a set of common criteria.  Care needs to be taken to  ensure that changes, post approval, do not undermine the application and assessment process which was open to all CE and T&uacute;s schemes.   CE sponsoring authorities and T&uacute;s implementing bodies have already commenced the recruitment to  these new placement opportunities and a number have already been filled. </p>  <p>  The primary focus for my Department is to continue to provide quality employment support opportunities for individuals who are long-term unemployed with the objective of bringing them closer to the labour market and employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to monitor the take up of these new places.</p>  <p>  I trust that clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Jobseekers can also register their interest through www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre. CE candidates are then referred to the CE scheme once their eligibility has been confirmed and CE is considered to be a suitable activation measure for that jobseeker. </p>  <p>  Under the Pathways to Work strategy, my Department appointed almost 100 additional dedicated Job Coaches nationwide to assist jobseekers in their efforts to return to full time employment.  The role of the Job Coaches includes the referral of eligible jobseekers to CE sponsoring authorities; if participation on this employment support would be of benefit to them.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that all long-term jobseekers who are currently engaged with the JobPath service continue to have opportunities to avail of placements on CE, while continuing to engage with the JobPath service.  This will enable people with the JobPath service to continue to receive the personalised employment counselling and job search support provided by JobPath personal advisors but also to avail of a CE placement which will provide valuable occupational activity, training and work experience. </p>  <p>  Where a jobseeker is already engaged with JobPath and wishes to participate on a CE scheme, they inform their JobPath personal advisor of their interest and the personal advisor follows up with the Department Intreo Service.  A member of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo activation team will then contact the jobseeker and refer them onto a CE scheme.  This ensures that there is single point of contact with CE schemes for referrals to fill vacancies.  I am not aware of any evidence, to date,  that indicates that this is contributing to some recent issues experienced on recruitment onto CE schemes, which are largely COVID related.  My priority and the priority of the Department is to ensure that the rate of referrals to CE schemes continues to increase and vacancies are filled, while continuing to comply with remaining public health restrictions.  </p>  <p>  During COVID,  a number of contingency measures were introduced to support CE schemes, including  on-gong extensions to existing CE participant contracts.  These support CE schemes and participants during COVID, while also reducing the number of vacancies on schemes.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  Qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance are those payments that are considered long term payments and an applicant must also satisfy a means test.  People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  It is for this reason that the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources to help this cohort of claimants.</p>  <p>  In the majority of cases, Illness Benefit is a short-term payment for those who are certified by their GP as needing to take time out from their employment due to illness, and accordingly is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  People who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for the non-means-tested Invalidity Pension, subject to satisfying the relevant social insurance and medical criteria.  Those who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means-tested Disability Allowance, subject to meeting the relevant medical criteria.  Recipients of both of these payments, subject to satisfying all qualifying conditions, may be eligible for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for Fuel Allowance to include people in receipt of Illness Benefit would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost, which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

I am aware that the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully considered the Commission's final report and determined that there was insufficient information available in the report to commence criminal investigation. In April 2021 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invited anyone who was the victim of a criminal act arising out of the Mother and Baby Homes, or who had information likely to assist an investigation into a criminal act committed at a Mother and Baby Home, to come forward and report this so that such crimes can be investigated where possible.</p>  <p>  The publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report followed on from confirmation by the Commission, in March 2017, of the presence of juvenile human remains at the site of the former Mother and Baby Home in Tuam. In response, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs commissioned an Expert Technical Group (ETG) to outline the options available for responding appropriately to the situation. One of the key challenges highlighted by the ETG in its report, which was published in December 2017, was the absence of an oversight body, party or state agency to lead the decision-making process in this context. </p>  <p>  Policy and legislation regarding exhumation or coronial inquests under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 or the Coroner&rsquo;s Act 1962, respectively, are not matters under the remit of my Department. However, the decision to develop the General Scheme of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill took into account the findings of the Expert Technical Group and the advice of the Attorney General, which underlined the need for a single statutory authority to oversee the full programme of intervention (including excavation, exhumation, identification and reinternment) required at the Tuam site and other locations should similar circumstances come to light. The Deputy may wish to note that existing coronial legislation makes no provision for a DNA identification process for sites such as the one at Tuam, and which is set out in the General Scheme of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill published by my Department earlier this year. </p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight that under the proposed legislation where the Director overseeing the intervention at a site recovers remains, which show evidence of violent or unnatural death, the Director must immediately inform the coroner within whose district the remains were recovered and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation for victims of DSGBV, is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing Tusla with core funding of &euro;30 million this year to fund DSGBV services.

While no environment is without risk in relation to Covid-19, and this has been the case throughout the pandemic, services can significantly reduce their risk level by closely following the expert guidance provided by the HSE, which was prepared specifically for ELC and SAC services by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). </p>  <p>  On November 26th, my Department issued a HSE memo to ELC and SAC providers informing them of the latest HPSC guidance along with guidance for testing and close contacts. Updated guidance has also been made available to service providers via my Department&rsquo;s 'First5' web-page.</p>  <p>  In an effort to assist services through the pandemic, my Department has provided a number of supports, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020 with an exemption to the requirement for other employers to demonstrate a 30% drop in turnover.  </p>  <p>  For over a year, between October 2020 and November 2021, EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates. This amounts to an investment of &euro;34 million per month in the sector and is estimated to cover, on average, 80% of staff costs and 50% of operating costs. </p>  <p>  EWSS is due to revert to standard rates between December 2021 and February 2022. This will amount to an investment of &euro;22 million per month in the sector and is estimated to cover, on average, 50% of staff costs and 38%  of operating costs. </p>  <p>  The additional cost of operating play-pods and other public health measures is estimated to be &euro;12 million per month. This indicates that there has been very substantial funding of the sector, and this funding remains in excess of what is required to adhere to public health guidance.</p>  <p>  Support is also available to concerned services through Case Management. My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to ELC and SAC services experiencing difficulties. The case management process can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  A Covid-19 Impact Support funding strand is available in 2021, for both community and private services. The funding is available on a rolling basis throughout 2021 for eligible ELC and SAC services that require further financial assistance in addition to current support measures available and others that may be announced throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The CCC should be the first point of contact for any service seeking support. I would therefore urge any SAC or ELC service in difficulty to contact their local CCC as soon as possible if they have not done so already.</p>  <p>  Local CCCs may be reached out of hours as well as during business hours. In February 2021 my Department established a national Covid-19 out-of-hours helpline which is hosted by the CCCs. The purpose of this helpline is to provide weekend support to ELC and SAC providers who have a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19 in their service. The 30 CCCs, funded by my Department, are available to provide support and guidance to ELC and SAC providers in respect of a broad range of Covid-19-related matters. The out-of-hours national helpline is an extension of this support for the sector.</p>  <p>  I have also convened two sub-groups on the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum - A Covid-19 Sub-Group and a Workforce Recruitment and Retention Sub-Group - to  provide an opportunity for information-sharing and discussion between my Department and key stakeholders on Covid-19 issues facing the ELC sector during the current period of high rates of Covid-19 cases and on possible responses, including the planned introduction of antigen testing of close contacts in ELC and SAC, similar to the programme in primary schools.</p></reply>

Overall policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation for victims of DSGBV, is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  Tusla informs me that it is actively engaged with Mayo Women's Support &amp;amp; Advocacy Service about their service and funding arrangements for 2022. The service has been invited to submit further information about any particular unmet need or service pressures they identify.</p>  <p>  Tusla is aware that recruitment and retention of staff is an additional pressure faced by many services working in the health and social care area which is particularly challenging for this service in the context of the level of demand for services.</p>  <p>  Tusla's core funding to Mayo Women's Support Services in 2021 is &euro;396,799, an increase of &euro;10,000 from their 2020 core funding. Due to additional pressures on the service in 2021 due to Covid-19, an additional &euro;20,299 was secured to date for additional relief staff, additional therapeutic services for children and other Covid-19 related expenses.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has recently provided information about mechanisms for domestic, sexual &amp;amp; gender-based violence (DSGBV) organisations to access resources on a short-term basis in order to assure their capacity to respond in the context of the worsening Covid-19 situation. </p>  <p>  My Department is providing Tusla with core funding of &euro;30 million this year to fund DSGBV services. This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core services, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In Budget 2022, Tusla has been allocated an additional &euro;41 million over the 2021 allocation. I have directed Tusla to use part of these additional resources to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Provision has been made in Budget 2022 to increase this entitlement further to seven weeks per eligible parent with effect from July 2022.</p>  <p>  The intention of this leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years. It is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child. This is further supported through the provision of Parents&rsquo; Benefit.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the entitlement under the 2019 Act is for each parent in their own right and is not an allocation per family. This is a requirement of the Work Life Balance Directive. The Act was drafted in such a way as to take account of the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent.</p>  <p>  This means that each parent of the child, and their respective spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, is entitled to take Parents&rsquo; Leave in respect of that child. In effect this means the parents of a child do not have to be a couple in order for each to qualify and that, if in separate relationships, their new partners can also qualify.  </p>  <p>  Commissioning surrogate parents may be entitled to Parents&rsquo; Leave, depending on their circumstances. The father of a child born through surrogacy can qualify for Parents&rsquo; Leave if he is the biological father of the child and declared to be the parent of the child. In these circumstances, the father's partner may qualify for Parents&rsquo; Leave if they are married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child&rsquo;s biological father, or have cohabited with the child&rsquo;s biological father for over 3 years.</p>  <p>  At a wider level, policy on surrogacy rests with the Minister for Health, and policy on parentage is a matter for the Minister for Justice. It is important to develop legislation on family leave in the context of the legal situation concerning parentage, including in relation to surrogacy. Any changes in the legal situation with regard to parentage and surrogacy are matters for the Minister for Justice and Minister for Health.</p></reply>

If an applicant or a family member has experienced a change in circumstances during 2021, then they can apply to SUSI for their application to be assessed or reassessed under a change in circumstances. The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale. For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student outlined by the Deputy applied to SUSI and then requested a review of her application due to a change of circumstances in 2021. The student has been awarded the maximum rate of grant available to her for her Postgraduate studies as the income for both 2020 and 2021 is over the Special Rate threshold. A dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members. This was established to meet an identified need for applicants who choose to engage the assistance of their public representatives in making enquiries about their grant applications.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of &euro;147.9m over four years and is the highest level of public expenditure on RDI since 2009.</p>  <p>  While this increase in public funding is welcome, I realise that it is not sufficient. Our RDI expenditure as a proportion of our overall Government expenditure has hovered below 1% for the past several years. Ireland lags behind the EU average and in particular behind EU innovation leaders such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s research intensity rate target is for RDI investment to reach 2.5% of GNP. In 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s RDI intensity rate (which includes both business and public RDI expenditure) was an estimated 1.63% of GNP, or 1.23% of GDP.</p>  <p>  A key challenge to closing the gap and reaching the RDI intensity rate target is the significant rate of increase in GNP compared to the RDI investment growth rate. From 2010 to 2020, GDP has increased by an estimated 123% in current values, GNP by 103% and GNI* by 62%. Over the same period, overall investment (both public and private) in RDI increased from &euro;2.67bn to an estimated high of &euro;4.6bn, an increase of 72%. Government budget allocations for Research &amp;amp; Development (GBARD) increased by an estimated 5.1%. The growth of the economy in the last decade has outpaced both increases in total investment in RDI and increases in public expenditure on RDI.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s future economic growth and prosperity will depend in large measure on our continued investment in research, development and innovation. This investment is targeted at developing a high productivity, knowledge-based economy and society, driving innovation in enterprise, building human capital and maximising the return on RDI investment for economic and social progress. </p>  <p>  The findings of the annual R&amp;D Budget Survey are important to inform evidence-based policy making and in the preparation of the forthcoming National R&amp;I Strategy 2021-2027. The Survey also supports various Government departments and agencies to inform their policies and to contextualise their activities.

There is no requirement for the DLP to be a mandated person under the Children First Act, 2015.  Therefore, the appointment of a DLP is not confined to schools or to teachers registered with the Teaching Council or indeed to mandated persons under the Act.  The DLP is a resource to any staff member who has a child protection or welfare concern and is responsible for ensuring that organisational reporting procedures are followed correctly and promptly and acting as a liaison person with other agencies. </p></reply>

Postgraduate scholarships are allocated solely on the basis of the quality of the research proposal as determined by independent international peer review. All successful applicants who meet the terms and conditions of the scheme are awarded a stipend of &euro;18,500 per year, up to a maximum of four years. </p>  <p>  A stipend is a well-established feature of funded postgraduate awards globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. The IRC has taken specific measures this year to enhance the support it provides to researchers of any career stage who are parents or carers. The IRC published a new policy in this regard effective 1 November 2021 which gives postgraduate awardees the entitlement to continuity of stipend for approved periods of leave for purposes of maternity, paternity or the adoption of a child. This policy introduces a new and important level of support for early-career researchers that become parents, including lone parents. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries from the Department of Social Protection in respect of this matter, as this question impinges on income support for lone parents. I understand that the Department of Social Protection encourages social welfare recipients to avail of education and training. In addition, income received from the SUSI grant is disregarded in the means test for most social welfare schemes. Any fees paid directly to the relevant educational establishment are not counted as means. I understand that disregards across all of the Department of Social Protection's schemes are kept under constant review and any changes have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

My objective is, therefore, to ensure that there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third-level. </p>  <p>  Our higher education system has expanded significantly over the past number of years, from 209,300 enrolments in 2014 to 245,700 enrolments in 2020. Projections of enrolment at third level predict that full-time student enrolments will rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase.</p>  <p>  While fully recognising the critical role of the higher education system, we are also working to strengthen the further education and training system under a new strategy for that sector.  This will help ensure that our tertiary education system as a whole equips our students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to secure good quality, well paid and sustainable employment.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure that our educational provision in the tertiary sector meets the existing and future skills demands of the fast-evolving jobs market. Central shaping these strategies is the partnership approach between the Further and Higher Education system and Government, Industry, the National Skills Council, the National Training Fund Advisory Group, the Regional Skills Fora and the Apprenticeship Council.</p>  <p>  The National Skills Council (NSC) within its remit advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high level trends identified at recent NSC meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the NSC and the other bodies engaged in our skills planning system shape the policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified graduates, and the initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue then, and produces the graduates the workforce needs with the skills that our economy and society require. </p></reply>

It recognises that a diverse range of strong, autonomous higher education institutions is essential if the overall system is to respond effectively to evolving and unpredictable economic and societal needs. It also recognises that funding and operational autonomy must be matched by a corresponding level of accountability for performance against clearly articulated expectations.</p>  <p>  Arising from recommendations in the National Strategy, the first System Performance Framework 2014-2016 was developed. This was followed by the second System Performance Framework 2018-2020, which articulates the Minister&rsquo;s key objectives for the higher education system. </p>  <p>  The framework forms the basis for the development and agreement of performance compacts between each higher education institution (HEI) and the Higher Education Authority (HEA), via a process of strategic dialogue. HEIs are required to report annually to the HEA on their progress and performance towards targets set out in the compacts. </p>  <p>  The most recent round of Strategic Dialogue was conducted by the HEA in June-July 2021 and feedback reports will issue to HEIs in the coming weeks. The HEA compiles and publishes a regular System Performance Report, which includes overall key system findings on higher education system performance and impact, and is submitted to the Minister. The HEA intends to compile a report covering the lifetime of the current System Performance Framework when the current cycle has concluded.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, the strategic policy context for the System Performance Framework has continued to evolve, including recent significant changes in the higher education landscape. The publication of the Statement of Strategy by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science earlier this year sets out the priorities of the new department for the period 2021-2023 and includes a commitment to deliver a revised system performance framework for Higher Education, which reflects national goals and priorities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, there is new legislation to be published aimed at reforming and modernising governance of the Higher Education sector, via the Higher Education Authority Bill and the development of the next System Performance Framework will await the publication of that legislation.</p>  <p>  Further details on the System Performance Framework are available at: hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/managing-performance/system-performance-framework/</p></reply>

The establishment of the Department last year signals the Government's commitment in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department is guided by the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030. This strategy sets the following high-level objectives:</p>  <p>  - Ireland will have an excellent higher education system that will attract and respond to a wide range of potential students from Ireland and abroad and will be fully accessible throughout their lives and changing circumstances;</p>  <p>  - Students will experience an education that is excellent, relevant and responsive to their personal development and growth as fully engaged citizens within society;</p>  <p>  - Research activity in Irish higher education will continue to increase. It will be characterised by its international level quality, by a strong and broad base across all disciplines, as well as significant focus in niche areas that are aligned with and are a significant support for Irish national economic social and cultural needs;</p>  <p>  - Institutions will be autonomous, collaborative and outward looking, effectively governed and fully accountable for both quality and efficiency outcomes. They will respond flexibly to the changing needs of the economy and of society. Higher education institutions will recruit, develop and retain high-quality staff, fully accountable for their performance to a strong and dynamic leadership;</p>  <p>  - Higher education will accommodate a diversity of institutional missions that will be clearly articulated and defined. Together, the institutions will form a coherent and inter-related system and collectively will have the requisite critical mass for optimal quality and efficiency;</p>  <p>  - The policy framework for higher education will make national expectations clear. The objectives and operations of the institutions and those of the funding and quality agencies will be mutually aligned, and will be underpinned by a sustainable funding model and clearly defined structures for system governance and accountability.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on furthering these objectives.</p>  <p>  For example, three technological universities have been established to date, with two further on course to be established in 2022. The development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway while the review of the Student Grant Scheme is at an advanced stage.  </p>  <p>  A report on the future sustainability of further and higher education will be considered by Government in the near future.</p>  <p>  Together these actions will support the development of our further and higher education and research systems to support people in reaching their full potential and to create value, prosperity, resilience and a cohesive, sustainable and vibrant society.</p></reply>

The market for innovation and research is also global &ndash; international cooperation in research and innovation plays an important role in the development and sustainability of a world-class innovation and research system.</p>  <p>  The centrality of the higher education and research systems in the innovation ecosystem and the availability of high-quality talent from the tertiary education system are core to Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career.</p>  <p>  In this year&rsquo;s European Innovation Scoreboard, in which Ireland is ranked the 11th most innovative Member State in the EU, Ireland performed well with its skilled workforce. Ireland came 5th overall and higher than the EU average in the Human Resources dimension, which measures the availability of a high-skilled and educated workforce. Within this, Ireland was 7th for New Doctorate Graduates, 3rd for Population completed tertiary education (aged 25-34) and 9th for Lifelong Learning.</p>  <p>  Through engagement in bilateral cooperation, via research and innovation  agreements, we build innovation capacity, facilitate researcher mobility, and  allow for economies of scale. Our research funders in different sectors engage in international cooperation to seek to influence European and international agendas and also to assist developing countries in addressing their challenges. The manifold benefits of international engagement accrue not only to our researchers but also to our enterprise base and to our public policy makers.</p>  <p>  I and my Department are determined to be the driver of a vibrant sector which produces individuals who are equipped with the skills that they need to progress in the way that they want to, and in a way that meets the needs of our evolving economy and contributes to an inclusive society. Not only will these individuals be equipped with expertise in research and innovation but I am also determined that the sector will continue to embrace and embed innovation in how it delivers and operates.</p>  <p>  As international competition for talent, investment and innovation grows more intense as nations strive to improve their standing as knowledge based economies, the establishment of a new Department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society.</p></reply>

The establishment of a new Department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society.</p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package.</p>  <p>  Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad.</p>  <p>  Launched in 2015, the National Framework for Doctoral Education underpins the drive for quality and consistency in the doctoral education experience across Ireland. It has four main objectives:</p>  <p>  - Facilitate consistent excellence in the quality of postgraduate education and training, including research undertaken at Master&rsquo;s and doctoral levels;</p>  <p>  - Enable and encourage higher education institutions to work more closely in the delivery of an improved learner-experience and outcome;</p>  <p>  - Maximise the employability of doctoral graduates across a broad range of employment sectors by ensuring that the acquisition of discipline-specific knowledge is complemented by the development of transferable skills;</p>  <p>  - Underpin the international standing of the Irish doctoral award.</p>  <p>  Advancement of the Framework is supported by the National Advisory Forum that is co-chaired by the HEA and QQI and whose membership includes all HEIs and research funders. The Framework sets out nine principles underpinning doctoral education in Ireland, to which the Forum members have all committed.</p>  <p>  A priority for this Government is to support business, invest in the development of people and to enhance skills and develop and attract talent to ensure our education and training system is responsive to enterprise needs. We must ensure that we have accessible upskilling options and that our education and training providers offer relevant and up-to-date courses which meet the needs of enterprises and workers.</p>  <p>  Higher Education institutions are constantly reviewing and updating their course curriculum in collaboration with enterprise to ensure that undergraduate and taught postgraduate course content is reflecting emerging trends in the future world of work and industry.</p></reply>

We are currently reviewing the grant scheme with a view to improving the scheme.  </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.

They continue, therefore, to take place on-site, consistent with the Safe Return Plan published by my Department last June.  The Safe Return plan has been supplemented by recent guidance in relation to the sectoral approach for this current phase of the response. </p><p>The Plan includes within it a commitment by the sector to work with public health authorities, and my Department continues to engage with public health in order to maintain and sustain the safe return.</p><p>On Friday 19<sup>th</sup>November last I met with management, staff and student representatives and the issue of end of semester examinations was discussed.</p><p>Due to the diversity of our higher education institutions, it was agreed that a uniform or one size fits all approach would not be appropriate across the whole of higher education. The basic principle of risk assessment and the application of appropriate precautionary measures, which has enabled and supported the safe return to onsite activities, will continue to apply.</p><p>Management bodies confirmed that they are actively looking at a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe, and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed.  It was also pointed out that there are some examinations &ndash; such as those related to external accreditation - which are challenging to change to an online format at short notice. </p><p>The outcome of the meeting was that individual higher education institutions will assess the appropriate approach to examinations consistent with the outcome of their risk assessments. Timely engagement and consultation with student and staff representatives at institution also has an important role to play.  </p><p>In all instances public health must remain a priority and there will be a continuing focus on the evolving and often quickly changing public health situation overall.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s scheme includes enhanced supports for postgraduate students which I secured in Budget 2021. This is an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support. I also secured an additional &euro;20m in Budget 2021 to meet anticipated demands on the scheme as a consequence of the Covid pandemic.    </p>  <p>  Approved  courses for the Student Grant Scheme are prescribed in the Student Support Regulations 2021 and in the Student Support Act 2011. The Regulations prescribe that an approved postgraduate course is a full-time course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution listed in the relevant Regulations. Under the current Regulations part-time, Online/Distance learning courses do not meet this definition and are not approved courses under the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  I am happy to give an update on the review of the Student Grant Scheme.  This was a  very important commitment in the Programme for Government, which will help shape decision-making on how we support students over the years to come. </p>  <p>  As part of the review of the Student Grant Scheme, the definition of &ldquo;an approved&rdquo; course within the current student grant scheme eligibility requirements is being examined. </p>  <p>  I am currently awaiting the final report of the review of the Student Grant System.

A concerted effort has been made over the past year to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, HSE, NGOs, community groups and other state agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse. This vital work is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups, including the recent seizure of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine with an estimated value of &euro;9,790,000 Dublin Port on 24 November.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the current pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. Operation Tara is focused on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs including crack cocaine.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include;</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; attached to the Divisional Drug Unit at Kevin Street Garda Station, with assistance from the Divisional Crime Task Force, conducted a search under warrant at a residence in Ringsend, Dublin 4 and seized &euro;123,000 worth of controlled drugs on Friday 8th October 2021.</p>  <p>  - As part of Operation Tara, Garda&iacute; from Naas recovered cannabis herb worth &euro;100,000in the course of searching a stolen motor van in Allenwood, Co Kildare on the 9th October.</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; from the detective and drug units in Gorey and Enniscorthy, conducted a search of a residence in Bunclody and seized a combined &euro;304,000 in cannabis and cocaine on Saturday, 23rd October 2021, approximately &euro;100,000 of cannabis herb, &euro;180,000 in cannabis resin and almost &euro;24,000 worth of cocaine (subject to analysis) was located at the residence.</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; from Cork based Drugs Units have seized drugs worth &euro;140,000 and arrested two males in the course of an operation in Cork on Thursday, 4th November 2021.</p>  <p>  All drugs seized are subject to analysis by Forensic Science Ireland (FSI).</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that The National Drugs Strategy is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland and advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute;, even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with drug related intimidation in a confidential and secure manner. Insofar as possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na offers confidentiality and provides practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for the individual in the family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint. </p></reply>

This sets out how the Inspector will conduct inspections of prisons and draws upon relevant international human rights standards, in particular the preventive approach and standards set by the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT).</p>  <p>  Issues raised by the Inspector, and the corresponding responses from the Irish Prison Service are set out in  the Inspector's reports upon publication.</p>  <p>  During 2019 staff of the Inspector of Prisons attended prisons on 69 occasions.  This was inclusive of a one-day oversight visit in each prison conducted by the Inspector in the performance of her statutory functions.  Details of these visits are available in the 2019 Annual Report from the Inspector which is available on the website of my Department and the website of the Inspector of Prisons. </p>  <p>  During 2020 the Inspector of Prisons visited every prison to assess the impact of the pandemic and details of these inspections are contained in the 2020 Inspector of Prisons Annual Report which is also available on my Department's website and on the website of the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  In addition to these short visits to each prison, a three day oversight monitoring visit of Mountjoy women&rsquo;s Prison (D&oacute;chas Centre) was conducted. The Inspector, in collaboration with Maynooth University also, embarked on a project to learn about the experience of prisoners cocooning during Covid, the report entitled &lsquo;Ameliorating and Impact of Cocooning of People in Custody &ndash; A Briefing&rsquo;. A copy of the report can be found on the website of the Inspector. </p>  <p>  This year, in response to the pandemic and in relation to the need to continue to monitor the situation within prisons for prisoners and staff, the Inspector suspended her 2021 general inspection programme and embarked on a COVID focused inspection schedule. This  is designed to provide a human rights-based assessment of the response of the Prison Service to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  On 3 August this year, Minister Naughton published the first four COVID - 19 Thematic Inspection reports received from the Inspector in relation to Mountjoy, Cloverhill, Wheatfield and Limerick Prisons and these are available on the website of my Department.  I have also received Covid -19 Thematic Reports relating to Shelton Abbey, Portlaoise, Cork and Arbour Hill prisons and my intention is to bring all four reports to Government shortly and to publish them thereafter. Thematic Reports for Loughan House Open Centre and Midlands Prison were submitted to my Department on the 19 November 2021 and will also be published in due course. </p>  <p>  Further, I am advised that the Inspectorate has also completed Covid Thematic inspections of Castlerea Prison and Mountjoy Women&rsquo;s Prison (D&oacute;chas) Centre, the reports of which I am informed will be submitted to me during the month of December and published in early 2022. </p></reply>

The applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications.</p>  <p>  In January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since the introduction of the temporary system, 8,196 citizenship applicants have been contacted and 7,405 new Irish citizens have received their certificates of naturalisation. My Department has prioritised the oldest applications on hand and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates since the start of the year.</p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. </p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

The Programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland. Key to the Programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.</p>  <p>  The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years. A report in relation to the second phase of an external review carried out is currently being considered by my officials and will be submitted to me thereafter. This report will be published in due course. Any actions and recommendations arising from the report which are beneficial to the Programme will be assessed and evaluated and consideration will be given to their introduction. </p>  <p>  More generally, projects seeking funding under the IIP are assessed by an independent Evaluation Committee, comprised of senior civil and public servants from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies involved in enterprise development in Ireland.  The Evaluation Committee convenes at least four times a year to assess projects submitted for consideration under the Programme.</p>  <p>  The independent Evaluation Committee makes a determination as to whether a project is suitable for IIP investment and if deemed suitable, the application will be submitted to me for final approval.  </p>  <p>  Detailed information in relation to the IIP and guidelines for applicants is available on my Department's Irish Immigration website at: www.irishimmigration.ie.</p></reply>

The purpose of the General Scheme of a Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to provide for amendments to provisions across a range of civil and regulatory law by way of updating and enhancing their application and to better meet current or pressing policy objectives.</p>  <p>  Miscellaneous Bills, such as this, offer an important opportunity to bring legislation up to date and make important technical and policy amendments that do not merit their own stand-alone legislation.  The General Scheme of the Bill has been referred to the Justice Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  As part of the pre-legislative process, a technical briefing on the General Scheme was due to be held on 4 November with officials from my Department. However, I understand that the Committee could not reach a quorum for the meeting and therefore it could not go ahead. I intend to write to the Committee shortly on the next steps. </p></reply>

Emergency care is provided for all children under 16. In addition, targeted screening and prevention is provided for school children at certain dental developmental milestones and for special needs groups.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately the Covid pandemic has impacted the provision of services across all areas of the health service and difficult decisions have had to be made on ensuring that priority is given to those with the most urgent need of care. It is also the case that a proportion of the HSE dental workforce has had to be diverted towards the burden of PCR testing and Vaccination throughout the pandemic and the need for such valuable trained staff to continue to support the pandemic remains a necessity; and I want to commend them for that.</p>  <p>  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy (2019), sets out Government policy regarding oral health services. It will involve a fundamental re-alignment of how oral health services are provided. Under the Policy, all children up to 16 years will have available to them eight oral healthcare packages consisting of examinations, assessments, advice, prevention interventions, emergency care and referral as appropriate. The packages will be provided in a primary care setting by oral healthcare practitioners contracted by the HSE and will be introduced incrementally. Engagement and collaboration with stakeholders will be required to ensure progress.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;22 billion is being provided in the Budget 2022 for all health services, including the Public Dental Service. I am satisfied that this global allocation provides sufficient resources to enable the HSE to put in place waiting lists initiatives for priority cases and to support the provision of oral health services for children and the vulnerable during the pandemic.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension, and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets (these values are halved if the applicant is part of a couple).</p>  <p>  In this way, for a decade, the scheme has ensured that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone who needs it.</p>  <p>  As such, the cost charged to residents is a contribution towards their care is based on the financial assessment of their ability to pay rather than the cost of care charged to the State. To illustrate this: if a resident is assessed as being able to contribute &euro;300 per week, this is what they will be charged whether they choose to stay in a private nursing home where the cost of care to the State might be &euro;1,000 per week, or in a public nursing home where the cost of care might be &euro;1,500 per week.</p></reply>

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. </p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continues to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.</p>  <p>  In addition, a fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.</p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce. </p></reply>

The NIAC advised that persons aged between 16-39 years who received an mRNA vaccine as their primary vaccine should be vaccinated in descending order by age cohort. Those aged 16-29 years who received Covid-19 vaccine Janssen as their primary vaccine can be offered a booster vaccine in parallel with those aged 30-39 years. Booster doses should be offered to those in previously recommended groups before progression to younger age cohorts.</font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">The NIAC had previously recommended that a booster of an mRNA vaccine be offered to persons aged 16-59 years with underlying conditions, all residents in Long Term Healthcare Facilities and persons aged 50-59 years. The booster should be given after a minimum interval of five months following completion of the primary vaccination schedule for those that received Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) Spikevax (Moderna) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca). Recipients of Covid-19 vaccine Janssen should receive an mRNA booster dose after an interval of three months. The Chief Medical Officer has endorsed these NIAC recommendations and has written to the HSE requesting they be operationalised as soon as possible. </font></p></reply>

Demand for testing is higher than it has been at any point in the pandemic and continues to increase. Approximately 215,000 PCR tests have been completed in the last 7 days.</p><p>While the system is currently operating in excess of surge capacity, it is kept under continuing review in order to maximise its use in responding to the threats posed by the virus. There are testing centres located all around the country. The HSE have worked to ensure that measures in childcare facilities are robust and prioritise the safety of staff and children in these settings. Schools and Childcare facilities are controlled settings and the approach to testing and contact tracing is risk-based in relation to the setting, age-group and the existence of other preventive measures. </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has published guidance on 'COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control guidance for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare settings during the COVID-19 Pandemic' which is available as follows: <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/childcareguidance/Guidance%20for%20services%20providing%20childcare%20services.pdf  </i></p><p>The HPSC has also published an updated guidance document 'Isolation quick guide for parents and guardians of children older than 3 months and up to 13 years of age', which is available as follows: <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/factsheetsandresources/Isolation%20quick%20guide%20under%2013s.pdf  </i></p><p>Further guidance on the management of Covid-19 in Early Years settings is published by Tusla as follows: <i>www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Guidance_Document_for_Early_Years_Services_COVID-19_(Version_3_19.04.21)_.pdf  ,</i></p><p>The role of testing and contact tracing, as part of the wider public health response, has been under ongoing review throughout the pandemic and will continue to be reviewed and amended in line with the epidemiological profile of the disease, its impact on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population and ECDC guidance.</p></reply>

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to increase capacity and activity for both orthopaedic and scoliosis patients are considered under the HSE National Service Plan 2022 and under the HSE Capital Plan. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p></reply>

An RMU is an organisation which provides health insurance only to its members, who are generally members of a common vocational or occupational group, and their dependants.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Health, I have oversight of private health insurance regulation under the Health Insurance Acts 1994-2020.  Under the Acts, open membership health insurers are obligated to provide insurance cover to any person who applies for it regardless of that person's personal circumstances, such as health status or age. RMUs are obligated to provide insurance cover to any person who qualifies as a member, and their dependants, without any requirements as to age. These obligations and other health insurance-specific market rules are overseen by the Health Insurance Authority as the regulator of the market.</p>  <p>  In the case where a person ceases to be a dependant of a member, for example where they cease to be married to the member of the medical society or where their spouse ceases to qualify as a member, an RMU is not obligated to continue to provide insurance cover to that person. Depending on the RMU's rules, the member may be required to inform the RMU of a change in marital status within a short period after the change occurs.</p>  <p>  Without further details it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the particular circumstance which the Deputy refers to in her question. I would advise if any person is unhappy with the actions taken by any health insurer they should in the first instance make a complaint to that health insurer. If the matter is not resolved to their satisfaction, they can make a further complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team gave some consideration to the issues arising for those people that can&rsquo;t receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons as part of its discussions on the 18th October 2021 on the continuing response to COVID-19 and the extension of Covid Pass arrangements. The matter is being given further consideration.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine. NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: </p><p><i>rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf</i></p></reply>

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to increase capacity and activity for both orthopaedic and scoliosis patients are considered under the HSE National Service Plan 2022 and under the HSE Capital Plan. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p></reply>

The updated guidance is now in place in the Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies and will be applied going forward to recruitment for postgraduate medical training programmes.</p>  <p>  All EU and non-EEA doctors, if they meet the eligibility criteria set out by each postgraduate training body, are eligible to apply to postgraduate medical training programmes. Following a competitive shortlisting and interview process, the postgraduate training bodies will allocate available specialist training places in the first instance to those candidates who, at the time of application, are: </p>  <p>  -  Citizens of Ireland</p>  <p>  -  Nationals of another Member State of the European Union (including EEA and Swiss nationals)</p>  <p>  -  UK nationals</p>  <p>  -  All persons currently holding a Stamp 4 immigration permission (including holders of a Stamp 4 EUFAM permission and holders of a Withdrawal Agreement Beneficiary card)</p>  <p>  Nationals of the United Kingdom are included in the category of persons to whom available specialist training places will be allocated in the first instance. Following the UK leaving the EU, UK nationals continue to be treated on a par (or on a reciprocal or equal basis) with Irish nationals in the context of all general rights and privileges to move freely and take up residence and employment within the Common Travel Area as reaffirmed in the Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Irish Governments of May 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed under the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Global Code on the Recruitment of International Health Personnel to strive for self-sufficiency with regard to the training and supply of medical specialists. This policy maintains a measure of self-sufficiency in the training of doctors and the allocation of specialist training positions while at the same time acknowledging the number of Non-EEA doctors working within the Irish health system and providing greater career opportunities for those eligible Non-EEA doctors. The policy regarding the allocation of specialist training places will be kept under review.</p></reply>

That Policy set out the roadmap for the future provision of oral healthcare to the eligible population. It has two key goals; first, to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their best oral health, and second, to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health. </p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), which dates from the 1990s is available to medical card holders aged 16 and over. The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. There is a need to align the DTSS with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there has been continued engagement between my officials, the HSE and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures, guidelines for safe dental practice, and ensuring that dental professionals were included in the high-risk group for early vaccination. This sustained engagement was with a view to ensuring that a safe satisfactory service could be continued for the eligible population. </p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there is a need for a substantive review of the DTSS and have given a commitment that the review would be undertaken. I have also acknowledged the immediate issues of concern with current arrangements under the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I instructed my officials to hold talks with the Irish Dental Association (IDA) to address both issues. I am aware that preliminary talks were held in June this year and that it is proposed to hold further talks in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I would also wish to point out that I secured additional funding of &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to address immediate issues with the DTSS, which is on top of the annual allocation of &euro;56 million for 2022. </p></reply>

In any event, if such a programme was to be conducted, it would be a matter for the Minister for Education. In terms of public health support to schools, the Minister for Education is running a scheme, with the assistance of the HSE, in which antigen tests will be made available to the children in a primary school pod, where a child in the pod has had a PCR test that detected COVID-19. Where two or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 occur in a class, within a seven-day period, outside of a single pod, antigen testing will be offered to the full class. Teachers and SNAs working closely with children in a pod or classroom where there is a confirmed case or cases may also avail of antigen testing through this programme.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on 18th November, to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, is outlined in the attached documents. The information set out in these documents shows the number of patients by hospital on the Inpatient &amp;amp; Daycase and Outpatient waiting lists.

While every effort is made to avoid cancellation or postponement of planned procedures, the HSE has advised that planned procedures and operations can be postponed or cancelled for a variety of reasons including capacity issues due to increased scheduled and unscheduled care demand.</p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups on 18 November to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The principal amendment of this Act ensures that where the owners of farms and businesses go into long-term residential care, their contributions against those assets will be capped at 3 years, providing that a named family successor commits to running the asset for a period of six years and certain other conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7).</p>  <p>  Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the "principal residence", is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person will be able to sell their home without incurring additional fees from the fourth year onwards. </p>  <p>  A person is eligible for the 3-year cap on the proceeds of sale from their principal residence as long as the sale takes place at any time after they have started receiving long-term residential care services.  However, the 3-year cap will only be applied to the proceeds of sale after 3 years in care. If a principal residence is sold, it is required that the HSE be notified within 10 working days, under Section 24 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. A re-assessment of an individual&rsquo;s financial means may be required. If the principal residence is sold before the 3 year cap period is completed, the net proceeds of sale amount is used in the calculation of the client&rsquo;s contribution to care until the three years has elapsed, and not the valuation of the residence on the date the resident entered care as would otherwise be the case. </p>  <p>  Cash assets that are not the proceeds of the sale of a primary residence are not covered by the 3 year cap and these assets continue to be included in the NHSS financial assessment regardless of the amount of time an individual has spent in care.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that transferred assets are considered to be assessable under the scheme. Under the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, a transferred asset is defined as an asset that has been transferred at any time in the period of 5 years prior to the date on which an application for State support is first made by or on behalf of that person.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-30a.1635.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000091#WRAA03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 to 621, inclusive, and 659 together.</p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of nurses and midwives in Ireland rests with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  The NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery, and to protect the public.  These obligations include:</p><p>- maintaining the Register of Nurses &amp;amp; Midwives,  </p><p>- setting the standards for the education and training of nurses and midwives,  </p><p>- approving programmes of education necessary for registration and specialisms and monitoring of these programmes on an ongoing basis,  </p><p>- supporting registrants by providing appropriate guidance on professional conduct and ethics for both registered nurses and midwives, and  </p><p>- conducting inquiries into complaints about  registrants.</p><p>On 1 November 2021, there were 81,331 nurses and midwives on the NMBI Register.  This is the highest ever number and is 2,003 or 2.5% above the 01 November 2020 figure of 79,328 registrants.</p><p>One of the cohorts of registrants on the NMBI register is nurses and midwives that have trained overseas.  Along with the NMBI, I welcome these overseas applicants as they seek to join the health service workforce in the State.</p><p>NMBI is currently receiving an increasing number of applications from these nurses and midwives that trained overseas who wish to join the NMBI&rsquo;s Register.  In October 2020, 530 new overseas applications for registration were received. The monthly average number of overseas applications in 2021 is 399.  This represents an increase of 55, or 16%, over the 2020 monthly average of 344. The numbers of overseas applications being processed to completion by the NMBI is also increasing. The 2021 monthly average number of registrations of overseas applicants is 292. This is 105, or 56%, above the 2020 monthly average of 187.</p><p>I am aware that the NMBI currently has a backlog of overseas applications to process.  These delays are due to an increase in overseas applications and also an earlier business need which arose where the NMBI needed to divert registration staff to work on the change to the new digital annual renewal system MyNMBI, for it's introduction in September 2020 for the annual renewal process for 2021.  </p><p>My Department is actively working with the NMBI to ensure all possible steps are being taken to minimise delays in the processing of overseas applications.  The NMBI have advised that 95% of overseas applications received are found to be incomplete on first examination and therefore require extra processing. There are currently 3,815 open, incomplete applications with NMBI at various stages of the recognition process. These comprise 715 submitted but not yet progressed by NMBI, 1,065 where NMBI has contacted the applicant for more information and 2,035 where NMBI is progressing and in reviewing these, additional information/documents will be required in many cases. Since 01 October 2020, there have been 4,101 new overseas (non-EU) applications. Since that date there have been 3,073 overseas nurses and midwives registered for the first time in Ireland.</p><p>The NMBI recognises the urgency in processing and progressing all applications for registration, particularly in the current climate where additional staffing is required around the country. Intensive efforts are continuing to expedite these overseas applications and several new measures are now planned by NMBI including:  </p><p>- additional resources, </p><p>- process improvements, </p><p>- applicant input and collaboration, </p><p>- updated NMBI guidance, and </p><p>- stakeholder communication and collaboration. </p><p>These measures will reduce the backlog and NMBI has informed  my Department that it expects to see evidence of this before the end of Q1, 2022.</p><p>It is important to note that applications to join the Register are made by individual nurses and midwives.  NMBI will continue to work with stakeholders across the health service to ensure they are doing all they can to facilitate recruitment, while continuing rigorous evaluating of information and thorough regulatory checks to ensure patient safety and the protection of the integrity of the professions.</p><p>In regard to the number of ICU nurses on the NMBI Register, that level of detail is not available on the MyNMBI system. The reason for this is that an ICU Nurse is not a HSE staffing category. Currently, an ICU nurse is categorised as a general nurse. There are currently 68,191 general nurses on the Register.  </p><p>NMBI is an independent regulatory body established under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011. While my Department is responsible for the oversight and governance of the NMBI, I have no role in setting or approving fees. Under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011, the NMBI is required to be self-financing, and the income from the Annual Retention Fee, which is paid directly to the NMBI, is required to carry out the statutory obligations that I have outlined above. The current annual retention fee is &euro;100 and is unchanged since 2014. This fee is NMBI&rsquo;s main source of income.</p><p>The income from the annual registration fee, for the past 10 years, is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>ARF total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>&euro;5.425m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>&euro;5.835m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>&euro;5.366m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>&euro;6.263m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>&euro;6.225m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>&euro;6.183m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;6.365m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;6.753m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;7.163m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;7.454m </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Certain groups, including those under 6 years of age and those over 70 years of age, are automatically entitled to a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, the person concerned having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area) can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign a GMS patient to a GP's GMS patient list. Likewise, a parent on behalf of a child GMS patient can, under the same circumstances, apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit also.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over previous years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with plans for further increases in future years.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

Last year additional funding of &euro;150 million was secured for home support to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide 5 million additional hours of home support.  The HSE National Service Plan sets a target to provide 24 million hours of home support this year and it is estimated that at the end of September some 15 million hours had been provided to over 53,000 people. This is about 2.2 million more hours compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The funding secured in Budget 2021 to provide these additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022.   </p>  <p>  Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to just under 400 last September.   This has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of funding to address those waiting.  </p>  <p>  However, there is a delay between the approval of funding and the delivery of home support hours and the numbers of people in both categories have increased steadily this year. At the end of September 2021, there were 4,933 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available, in January 2020 there was about 1,300 people in this category. Certain areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,300 at the end of September.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is aware that there are increasing capacity issues across both direct and indirect provision and it continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for Health Care Assistants and recruits as many suitable candidates, where possible. The HSE conducts its recruitment through a variety of channels both locally and nationally.  </p>  <p>  Due to the nature of Healthcare Support Assistant posts, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level and is on-going continually across the HSE. Approved Home Support Providers also continue to recruit home support workers. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing within the Department to progress the development of the new statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of the 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support commenced ?in November 2021 in one pilot site, with other pilot sites to be fully operational by January 2022. </p>  <p>  I am committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development, and the sustainable employment of home support workers and nursing home workers into the future. </p></reply>

This increase is resulting in a higher number of admissions to the hospitals. The care needs of many of these patients require a greater length of stay in hospital. Covid-19 is also continuing to have a significant impact on bed capacity, either in caring for patients with the virus, or as a result of bed closures caused by Covid restrictions. </p><p>Bed capacity has also been impacted by staffing resources. A significant overseas Nursing recruitment campaign is being progressed by the Saolta Group with the intention of having additional resources coming into the service within the next 3 months. Interviews are on-going at present, with an expected arrival date of January 2022 for the first tranche of nurses.</p><p>Plans for additional capacity across Saolta sites are outlined below:</p><p><b>University Hospital Galway: </b></p><p>Ahead of the proposed new Emergency Department development at University Hospital Galway, Saolta Hospital Group advises that the handover of the Temporary Emergency Department (Phase 1) in UHG is scheduled for end of April 2022, with the handover of the internal replanned area (Phase 2) scheduled for end of July 2022.  The temporary ED facility, and in particular, the development of a new Emergency Department and Women &amp;amp; Children&rsquo;s Block at the hospital, are key to addressing accommodation issues and meeting service demands.</p><p>Construction of a replacement cardiothoracic ward commenced in Q2 2021. This will provide 12 additional beds. The works are expected to be completed in Q2 2022.</p><p><b>Mayo University Hospital:</b></p><p>Funding is being  provided for 40 beds off site.  At this point 18 are operational and a further 12 will be available early in 2022. </p><p><b>Portiuncula University Hospital: </b></p><p>The design of a 12 bedded isolation ward in a vacated area of the hospital is progressing and it is expected that this work will be completed in 2022. </p><p>In addition, a new ward block development will provide a 50-bed replacement ward. Tenders are due in for this work in December, with the intention of awarding a contract early in  2022.  </p><p><b>Sligo University Hospital: </b></p><p>It is intended that enabling works for a medical block, consisting of 42 bedded single room accommodation with ancillary space, will begin in early 2022. </p><p><b>Letterkenny University Hospital: </b></p><p>An additional 39 beds were approved for LUH in 2020/2021, 16 beds of which are currently operational.

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.</p></reply>

There is an obligation on employers to risk assess all known hazards including psychosocial hazards, which might lead to stress. </p>  <p>  In response to the current COVID-19 crisis the HSE is co-ordinating a comprehensive psychosocial response to address the overall emergency and its impact into the future. Further details can be found here www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-services/psychosocial-response-group/</p>  <p>  Each local CHO area offers a number of key supports:</p>  <p>  - A Psychological First Aid Call Back Service - for health care workers and some targeted groups of the public, who may be feeling stressed or anxious about the impact of COVID-19</p>  <p>  - Trained psychosocial responders will provide a brief telephone contact to help callers to cope with the daily challenges at this time.</p>  <p>  - Psychological First Aid Informed Briefings for Healthcare Workers have also been developed and are available on HSELanD, the HSE&rsquo;s training and development portal.</p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel recommendations, I was pleased to announce as part of Budget 2022 that funding is being made available to the HSE to undertake a further once-off programme in 2022 to provide enhanced psychological supports to nursing home residents, families and staff. Each nursing home will be offered an opportunity to participate. Department officials are engaged with the HSE on the roll-out of this intervention over the coming months and further detailed planning will be undertaken following the completion of the 2022 National Service Planning process.</p>  <p>  For private and voluntary nursing homes, the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary administrative measure in response to the challenges faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic. As of 24 November, over 8,172 claims had been processed as part of the Scheme, reimbursing nursing homes for a broad range of expenses incurred as a result of the pandemic, including measures aimed at the workforce such as training and other supports. In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  While the standard assistance element of the scheme ceased at the end of June 2021 having already been extended twice, TAPS has broadly fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department is currently conducting the first part of Phase 3 of the Safe Nurse and Skill Mix Framework (SSF).  Phase 3 (a) will develop an evidence-based approach to determining the staffing and skill mix required in a long-term residential care setting. Staffing levels determined by the SSF are directed and implemented based on evidence from patient / resident outcomes as the key indicator of the staffing adjustment needed. This flexibility has proven successful in the previous two phases of the SSF.  The National Taskforce for Phase 3 of the SSF commenced in February 2021 and has undertaken a review of the available international evidence and selected a model for further testing. Following an open call, nine pilot sites have been chosen from across the country to test the model identified. Baseline data collection in the pilot sites will start imminently, once local governance structures are in place, with staffing adjustments expected to be made in the pilot sites in Q1 2022. Based on the evidence Phase 3 (a) will, in line with other phases, be developed into a national policy for broader implementation. This flexible, evidence-based approach to nurse staffing and skill mix will enable informed staffing levels based on patient / resident need across the variety of nursing home / residential care settings in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development, and the sustainable employment of home care workers and nursing home workers into the future.  </p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's questions to the HSE and have asked the Executive to advise him of the relevant operational supports it is providing, internally and to the sector.   </p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive review of the operation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) identified the need to undertake a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF. The Minister for Health subsequently requested that the NTPF carry out a review of the pricing system. A steering group was established with representation from various departments and agencies and expert advice and stakeholder submissions were sought. The terms of this review were to:</p>  <p>  - Ensure value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increase the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensure that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>   Both Minister Donnelly and I have considered the review, agreed to the recommendations within, and have requested that the Department and NTPF move forward with delivery of the recommendations that they are responsible for. This review is published on Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Safe Staffing Framework is an evidence-based methodology to determine the required nursing workforce based on patient acuity and dependency. The Framework was launched by Minister Harris, on 16 April 2018, on publication of the Final Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing, on a Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Adult Hospitals (www.gov.ie/en/publication/2d1198-framework-for-safe-nurse-staffing-and-skill-mix-in-general-and-speci/). To date there have been three phases of the Safe Staffing Framework Development, Phase 3 being the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing in Community settings, including (a) Long-Term residential care settings for older persons, (b) Community care settings, and (c) Step-down and Rehabilitation settings.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department is currently conducting the first part of Phase 3 of the Safe Nurse and Skill Mix Framework (SSF).  Phase 3 (a) will develop an evidence-based approach to determining the staffing and skill mix required in a long-term residential care setting.

To continue to meet the ongoing demands caused by the pandemic, as well as to provide necessary resources for the longer-term health care requirements of our population, the health sector workforce is expanding. There are significant recruitment campaigns, both in Ireland and Internationally ongoing across all Hospital Groups on a continuous basis.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to funding the provision of healthcare in order to deliver services in line with Sl&aacute;intecare objectives. This is underpinned by the provision of funding in Budget 2022 which allows for the continued growth of the health sector workforce up to an estimated 141,491 WTE in 2022. This would be a further increase of 10,855 WTE from the current numbers equating to an increase of 8%. </p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the HSE, the Interdepartmental Group for Economic Migration Policy and other Government Departments regarding employment permits and the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system operated by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and or labour shortages. The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists, which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit, where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market. </p>  <p>  The Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process which involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  </p>  <p>  As part of the most recent review of the occupations lists, officials from my Department engaged in discussions with officials from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in respect of submissions received relating to the health sector. The submissions received from the home care sector were considered by the Department of Health, Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Interdepartmental Group for Economic Migration Policy.</p>  <p>  The review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggested that contracts of employment and terms and conditions being offered are significant factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. To have an occupation removed from the ineligible list, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to skills and labour shortages in Ireland and the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and or employment conditions. </p>  <p>  It was not considered appropriate to make any changes to the eligibility for employment permits for home carers on this occasion as there was insufficient evidence that the issue is not one of terms and conditions. A longer-term approach is required to address these challenges and the Department of Health is committed to working with relevant stakeholders to seek to address these issues.</p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Mental Health and Older People has committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine the evidence regarding the skills and labour market shortage, in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, skills development, and sustainable employment of home carers into the future. Part of the work of this group will involve engagement with the relevant stakeholders in the sector.</p></reply>

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.</p><p>Significant activity is currently underway to enhance the supports available to women through the menopause. Minister Donnelly announced his commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland on the 10th of September. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p><p>The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. Further details on this announcement can be found here:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/bf7d4-minister-for-health-announces-a-new-approach-to-menopause-care-for-women-in-ireland/</p><p>Funding for a further three specialist menopause clinics were announced within Budget 2022.</p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:</p><p>- GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; a recent ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology Course which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area. The Minister has outlined his support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This is currently being progressed and will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in General Practice. </p><p>- A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause is scheduled for November 29th 2021. </p><p>- A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18th, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service will be held on November 30th.  The Healthy Workplace Framework is due to be published in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. This has particular reference to increased awareness of menopause within the workplace.</p><p>In addition to the activity outlined above, menopause will continue to be a priority for the Women's Health Taskforce for 2021 and 2022.</p></reply>

The Work Safely Protocol is a revision of the Return to Work Safely Protocol published in May 2020. The revised Protocol incorporates the current advice on the Public Health measures needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community and workplaces and sets out detailed guidance for all workplaces, including checklists for inspections. </p>  <p>  The Protocol is a general document applicable to all sectors. It sets out the minimum measures required in every place of work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to facilitate the reopening of workplaces following temporary closures and the ongoing safe operation of those workplace. Further information on the Protocol is available at:- www.gov.ie/en/publication/bb7fd-work-safely-protocol/</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has continued to carry out compliance checks across all workplace sectors, in particular in food processing plants, recognising these areas are particularly high risk. There have been very close interactions with this sector throughout the pandemic, to ensure they are in compliance with Covid guidelines. In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine veterinary inspectors and other inspectorate staff are carrying out compliance checks in the various food businesses under their remit. The level of compliance found by the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine inspections continues to be high in food plants. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, a programme of serial testing of employees continues to be carried out by the HSE in food businesses with more than 50 employees. That testing programme is now in its 16th cycle of 4 weekly testing in food plants.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE launched a COVID-19 communications campaign to encourage safe behaviours as we learn to live with COVID-19. The campaign encourages people to continue the safe behaviours of hand washing, physical distancing, wearing face coverings, covering coughs and sneezes and downloading the COVID Tracker app.</p>  <p>   The campaign also includes radio adverts on all Irish commercial stations and on Spotify, Youtube, and social media messages on all HSE and Department of Health social media accounts. The campaign has been extended to include TV advertising, and spots on online players.</p>  <p>   Further information on the campaigns can be found at: </p>  <p>  www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/newsfeatures/covid19-updates/partner-resources</p></reply>

This increase is resulting in a higher number of admissions to the hospital. The care needs of many of these patients require a greater length of stay in hospital. Covid-19 is also continuing to have a significant impact on bed capacity, either in caring for patients with the virus directly, or as a result of bed closures caused by Covid restrictions. </p>  <p>  Bed capacity has also been impacted by staffing resources. A significant overseas Nursing recruitment campaign is being progressed by the Saolta Group with the intention of having additional resources coming into the service within the next 3 months. Interviews are on-going at present, with an expected arrival date of January 2022 for the first tranche of nurses.</p>  <p>  The design of a 12 bedded isolation ward in a vacated area of the hospital is progressing and it is expected that this work will be completed in 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition, a new ward block development will provide a 50-bed replacement ward. Tenders are due in for this work in December, with the intention of awarding a contract early in  2022. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Saolta Group is working with colleagues in Community Healthcare West and Community Healthcare Organisation 1 to enhance community care, particularly in relation to  respiratory, diabetes and older peoples services.  This will help to reduce the number of future admissions to the hospital.</p></reply>

Over 50,000 farmers are expected to participate in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Eco-Scheme will be an annual agri-environmental scheme under the next CAP.  To participate in any given year, a farmer will have to select two actions from a list of options.  The proposed list includes an option to plant three trees per hectare in the year.  This equates to 100 trees for a farmer with the national average farm size of just over 33 hectares per annum.   There is also a proposed enhanced tree planting option where a farmer can plant double the numbers outlined above annually if they wish to solely plant trees to draw down their Eco-Scheme payment. </p>  <p>  Regarding climate commitments, trees that occur in hedgerows or outside forests are not considered forest and are not included as part of the land use sector for national greenhouse gas reporting. To address the lack of data on carbon sequestration by such trees, Teagasc are undertaking a research project called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo; which may provide for these trees to be counted in the inventory in the future.</p>  <p>  In addition to the tree planting proposed under CAP, my Department will continue to promote afforestation including broadleaf planting to contribute to the achievement of our climate change targets.</p></reply>

The new strategy will be based on a national shared vision. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive consultation process for the new vision and strategy have commenced and I would like to invite everyone who has an interest in forestry to actively participate in this consultation exercise. </p>  <p>  The new Forestry Programme will again be funded nationally and will be subject to State aid approval by the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Due to the long-term nature of forestry, it is not proposed to include forest planting measures in the new CAP measures, however, as the CAP framework normally sets the requirements for the new EU State aid Guidelines, there will be close alignment between the two programmes.</p>  <p>  In respect of the integration of forestry and the next CAP, as outlined in the CSP draft interventions that have been published by my Department, several tree planting measures have been proposed to be included in the CAP Strategic Plan. </p>  <p>  The new Forestry Programme and the new CAP will provide opportunities to further align agricultural support schemes and forestry, to better integrate planting into the farming system, and to remove any barriers to uptake.</p></reply>

This allowed parcels to remain free of GLAS actions for other uses including forestry.  The GLAS terms and conditions outline that afforestation is fully compatible with GLAS and is recognised as contributing to the creation of a valuable landscape mosaic at farm-level.  The Scheme also had the &ldquo;Planting a Grove of Native Trees&rdquo; action which has been chosen by over 3,600 farmers and resulted in the planting of over 1.5 million trees.</p>  <p>  Analysis shows since the start of the scheme, approximately 1,000 GLAS participants have applied for or have in fact gone on to plant forestry.</p>  <p>  It is now well-established that the overall number of landowners, both farmers and non-farmers who are choosing to plant forestry is in decline.  </p>  <p>  There are many reasons for this decline, landowners have options for their land, including lease or the sale of lands and regulatory difficulties.  I would also like to note that non-farmer applicants may well be the relative of a deceased or retired farmer, who have made the decision to plant forestry rather than farm the land.  </p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, I am anxious that farmers engage with forestry and I acknowledge that current licensing difficulties are likely a contributory factor in terms of reduced interest.  </p>  <p>  This is a priority issue for me and my Department and is being dealt under Project Woodland. Alongside Project Woodland, we are committed to improving our delivery and  we now have 10 ecologists assigned exclusively to afforestation files. </p>  <p>  We intend to recruit more ecologists for afforestation and are working to streamline the processing of these files.  While these changes will take some time to work through the system, we anticipate that they will deliver an increase in the number of afforestation files issuing.</p>  <p>  The Department is working to ensure that there is integration between Agri-Environment schemes in CAP and the new Forestry Programme.  It is intended that tree planting measures will form part of the new Agri-Environment schemes.  </p>  <p>  The transitional REAP scheme (a results-based payment approach for grasslands) has, for instance, complementary tree-planting actions. In addition,  direct payments will be eligible to be made on areas afforested under the new CSP, in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 4(4).c(iii) of the draft CSP Regulation. </p>  <p>  There will also be an opportunity with the proposed new Forest Strategy, which will underpin the next Forestry Programme, to look at new at ways in which to engage farmers and indeed all of society with our ambition to create 8,000 hectare of forest per year.  We will be undertaking an extensive consultation exercise to inform our response to this challenge and I would encourage all those interested in the future of  forestry in Ireland to take part in this process.</p></reply>

These fodder budgets were carried out as part of a new initiative to promote better feed security planning on livestock farms.  </p>  <p>  While I know and appreciate that their might anomalies to this but the survey concluded that the national picture shows drystock farms reporting a projected surplus of approximately 29%, while dairy farms are similarly well placed at approximately an 18% overall surplus. The survey shows that all regions are in a good position for feed stocks. Again. I appreciate that there could be anomalies to this survey. </p>  <p>  2021 has been a good grass growing year and there were periods of good weather allowing excellent quality fodder to be made. Farmers have also had the benefit of an extended grazing period this autumn/early winter which has the effect of reducing fodder demand. I think the Deputy will agree that, in particular, the back end proved to be excellent grazing conditions in most parts of the country. </p>  <p>  Taking all of this into account, I encourage farmers to complete their own fodder budgets before winter sets in to ensure that they have enough fodder and to contact their local adviser for any help they need.</p>  <p>  Based on the results of Teagasc's fodder survey, and as things stand, I do not see the need for my Department to intervene at this time given that the position regarding the availability of fodder is very healthy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-30a.2035.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000097#WRGG02200"><p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.  The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).   This will lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishers and to more sustainable fishing patterns.   Fisheries are managed on the basis of a population of a species living in a defined geographical area with similar biological parameters (e.g. growth, size at maturity, fecundity) and a shared mortality rate.  The stocks managed by the EU TAC and quota regime, which establishes outtake levels on an annual basis, are distributed across a large geographical area generally off the west, south west and often the south east of Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 47% of the stocks of interest to Ireland were fished at or below MSY - this increased from 34% in 2013.  In 2009, at EU level only 5 stocks were fished at MSY.  This shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures within the framework of the CFP are paying off.  </p>  <p>  The process of negotiating and agreeing TACs for 2022 involves EU negotiations with the UK in respect of shared stocks and covers most of the stocks of importance to Ireland other than those determined at Coastal States negotiations including mackerel and blue whiting.  These negotiations commenced on 11 November and are ongoing.  Ireland is inputting its position and issues into the EU&rsquo;s position and is actively engaged in these negotiations  to ensure that matters of importance to Ireland,  such as the Celtic Sea mixed fishery,  are understood and pursued.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I launched a public consultation on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for 2022, along with the scientific advice on fish stocks from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), as part of my annual Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA).  The SIA draws its conclusions from a consultation process with all major stakeholders, a public consultation and expert contributions from the Marine Institute (MI) and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  The objective of the SIA is to look at the overall impacts the proposals for quotas could have on the sustainability of the fishing sector from a biological, economic and social perspective.   I will present the SIA to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in early December.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry and we are committed to working to continue to build on the progress that has been made to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry and the coastal communities which depend upon it. </p></reply>

The Scheme was established as a targeted measure for certain segments of the fishing fleet to mitigate the loss of income in 2021 arising from the significant quota reductions under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The scheme is administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  As recommended by the Task Force, the scheme is open to whitefish vessels in the Polyvalent and Beam Trawl segments of the fishing fleet and provides aid to vessels opting to tie-up for a calendar month during the October to December period, thereby freeing up quota for vessels that remain fishing.  Vessels excluded by the UK from the Rockall squid fishery are eligible for an additional month of tie-up.  </p>  <p>  BIM has confirmed to me that a total of 219 applications have been made for tie-up in either October, November or December 2021.   BIM advises that the number of number of successful applicants can be expected to be lower, as eligibility checks remain ongoing at this point.</p>  <p>  With respect to domestic seafood retailers, I understand that representatives of the fishing sector on the Task Force undertook to carefully manage supply during the period of the scheme.  The report of the Task Force made no specific recommendations for financial supports to seafood retailers. </p></reply>

To the end of 2019, over 520 arrangements covering approximately 19,000 hectares had been facilitated. In recognition of this, my Department is engaged with the Land Mobility Service on potential future support and I have just announced a 100% increase in the funding for next year to &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware  that the Land Mobility Service also receives funding from the wider sector and a contribution from land-owners and farmers. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, &ldquo;Inquiries, Engagements and Arrangements&rdquo; continued to grow in 2020 with the cumulative figure in excess of 600 covering over 22,000 hectares, with a final Report on Outputs for 2021 due to be finalised shortly by LMS. </p>  <p>  On generational renewal generally, under the current CAP the Young Farmers Scheme (with payments of &euro;110m benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year) and the National Reserve (with &euro;35 million allocated since 2015) provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40% (over &euro;133m paid to over 5,000 farmers). There are additional supports at national level, with strong taxation measures assisting land mobility and facilitating succession (worth some &euro;200 million per annum), access to finance measures and a range of educational, training and advisory services. </p>  <p>  Specifically Long-Term Leasing Income Tax Relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers. Almost 11,000 beneficiaries were supported under this measure in 2018, with a cost of &euro;27.2 million. </p>  <p>  Supporting young farmers, access to land and generational renewal are priorities for me, and I will continue to actively engage on these issues, including with the Land Mobility Service, farm organisations and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

Obviously this also concerns older farmers and while there are a number of supports currently available under the CAP specifically for young farmers, these are complemented by a suite of national taxation measures that assist both younger and older farmers.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the priority of my Department has shifted to the encouragement of generational change for farmers by assisting the development of our young farmers. There are a range of supports in place including specific agri-taxation measures to incentivise this generational change. The agri-taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers include 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers and stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers.</p>  <p>  Under the current Rural Development Programme, there is also an enhanced capital investment Scheme for young trained farmers under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. This Scheme provides them with grant aid at a rate of 60% of the cost of the investment, compared to the standard grant rate of 40%, and I believe it is an important support and encouragement to young farmers starting in agriculture for the first time.</p>  <p>  Generational renewal continues to be a priority of mine and it will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  </p></reply>

In the recent past the Council installed pontoons at the mainland harbour at Ros a&rsquo; Mh&iacute;l, which has greatly improved accessibility for all, particularly for those passengers that are wheelchair users. </p>  <p>  My Department does, however, address the issue of accessibility when tendering for the service. Tenderers must consider and make suitable arrangements for passengers with disabilities, including passengers of reduced mobility, to and from the vessel. In doing so, the Guidelines for Accessible Maritime Passenger Transport which have been issued by the Department of Transport and the National Disability Authority should be taken into account and complied with, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  As technologies evolve and better quality vessels with better and more inclusive accessibility solutions become mainstream, the Department will review and amend its Request for Tender documents to encourage potential operators to upgrade their fleet of vessels so that wheelchair users and passengers of reduced mobility can expect a higher quality of service as they travel to and from the Aran Islands.</p></reply>

Table 1 provides the number of remote working hubs onboarded onto the platform to date by county, together with remote working hubs that have been mapped to be invited to join the National Connected Hubs Network. </p><p>Earlier this year I awarded almost &euro;9 million in funding through the Connected Hubs stream to add capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and broadband connection points throughout the country.  </p><p>The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery. Officials in my Department will continue to consider options to support the development of remote working hubs over the coming years. </p><p>TABLE 1 &ndash; Connectedhubs.ie - Remote Working Hubs by County (as at 26 November 2021) <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Live on the connectedhubs.ie platform</th>       <th>Mapped to be invited to join the connectedhubs.ie platform </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>294</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-30a.2093.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021113000098#WRHH01300"><p>Walking trails that traverse private land are generally provided on a permissive access basis. Compensation payments are not available for the provision of this permissive access by the landholder. However, my Department operates the Walks Scheme which contracts landholders to undertake maintenance work on National Waymarked Ways and other priority trails that traverse their lands. The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  On 29 September, I announced the 'approval in principle' of 31 new trails to join the Walks Scheme. This fulfils the commitment in the Programme for Government and Our Rural Future to double the number of trails on the Scheme to 80 trails. These trails will be formally brought into the scheme by Local Development Companies who deliver the Walks Scheme locally and who will develop work plans for each of the individual landholders involved.  </p>  <p>  Once these trails are fully operational under the Scheme, I will examine the potential for the further expansion of the Scheme. An expression of interest process will be opened for new trails in advance of any further expansion of the scheme. </p></reply>
