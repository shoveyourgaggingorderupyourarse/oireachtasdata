    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600055#WRA00800"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for his concerns about the safety and welfare of Tusla's service users, particularly children and young people, following the recent cyber attack on HSE and Tusla systems.  The safety and welfare of children and young people has always been Tusla's highest priority. </p>  <p>  Early in the pandemic, Tusla identified three core services to be prioritised: Child Protection, Children in Care, and Domestic, Sexual, and Gender Based Violence services. It was recognised that particular supports were required for those cohorts in the context of COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  Arising from the recent cyber attack, these key services were again prioritised. Social workers continued to visit children and to work with them and their families throughout this period. Decisions about risk to children continued to be made by social workers and their team leaders with families and other professionals.  </p>  <p>  Manual records were initially used by Tusla staff following the cyber attack.  I am pleased to confirm that the National Child Care Information System was restored to full use on 28 June.  Since then, Tusla has prioritised the input of new referrals to the system, including referrals received since the cyber attack. Case information and updates that were recorded on paper are also being systematically entered into the system. The recovery of this system is a great achievement, that comes from the strong teamwork of Tusla, the HSE, and its partners. Recovery work continues on other key systems. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied, that Tusla has acted promptly and appropriately to protect the children in its care and to combat the risks it faces, following the cyber attack.  The Government has done all it can to assist Tusla in its ICT recovery work, particularly in securing the sensitive personal information associated with the Agency's files and data systems. Tusla has publicly indicated that there has been no evidence of date, of data being used inappropriately. </p>  <p>  Throughout this time, child protection services have continued to operate. I would like to publicly pay tribute to the front line staff of Tusla, who had already faced many difficulties since the emergence of COVID-19 last year. I believe we as a society owe a huge debt to the work of child protection and welfare staff, who contribute so much to the safety and wellbeing of children in our communities. </p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a national advertising campaign to advise the public to make referrals to their local Tusla office by phone. Contact details can be accessed on the Tusla website. </p>  <p>  Anyone with concerns in relation to the welfare of a child should continue to relay these concerns by phone, to the local Tusla Duty Social Work office, or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Equally, should anyone come into contact with what they perceive to be data that may be stolen from Tusla, they should immediately contact Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600056#WRB00900"><p>The grounds of the former mother and baby institution at Bessborough extended originally to around 200 acres. In its Fifth Interim Report, the Commission of Investigation noted that 'About 100 acres were sold in 1973 for the building of the N25 and for social housing. The Commission understands that there are about 60 acres of ground around the building now.' </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary retains part of the site; some land has been transferred to the HSE; and other land is owned by private parties who intend to develop the site for housing, subject to the appropriate permissions. </p>  <p>  The Commission concluded that it is likely that burials did take place in the grounds of Bessborough but that the location of burials at Bessborough could not be ascertained, that the site was too large to feasibly excavate and that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of the likely location of burials.</p>  <p>  A particular part of the site, not in public ownership, is identified on a 1950s ordnance survey map as a burial ground. Campaigners consider it the most likely location of burials. It is notable that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused permission to develop the land because it 'is not satisfied that the site was not previously used as, and does not contain, a children's burial ground and considers that there are reasonable concerns in relation to the potential for a children's burial ground within the site [...]'.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the Bessborough lands requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusions of the commission&rsquo;s report. Like himself, I attended and made an oral submission to the Oral Hearing on the SHD application. </p>  <p>  As the land in question is in private ownership, it is not open to Government to procure or carry out investigations there. </p>  <p>  I have recently written to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage asking him for support in encouraging local authorities to provide specific protections within their Development Plan processes for any burial sites that may be linked to former Mother and Baby Homes or County Homes.  I know that Cork City Council has committed to undertaking its development plan process and I would urge the councillors to take account of the Commissions conclusions in the zoning of the land.</p>  <p>  I continue maintain a close interest in the Bessborough site, and I will continue to engage with survivors and the local authorities in terms of protecting this site. </p></reply>

Some supports for victims are available through the services of Tearmann including outreach services in Counties Cavan and Monaghan. However, women seeking emergency domestic violence accommodation will typically seek refuge in Counties Louth and Meath, where there are three refuges supported by Tusla.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Tusla is currently finalising a review of emergency accommodation nationwide, which assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. The review has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. </p>  <p>  It presents recommendations on future configuration of accommodation and services that may be required to meet holistically the needs of victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence. I understand that Tusla has also had some ongoing engagement with various local stakeholders about refuge developments, including a recent meeting in May with a local group exploring development of domestic violence refuge.</p>  <p>  As capital funding for domestic violence refuges is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the development of future refuge requires the strong engagement of both Departments. I have spoken to Minister O'Brien on this issue and we are committed to engaging further on this matter. </p>  <p>  I am also aware that as a signatory of the Istanbul Convention, we have made commitments in law to improve services to victims in this area. We have some ground to make up in this respect. I am committed to doing all that I can, as Minister with responsibility for Tusla and equality matters, to bring this about.</p>  <p>  The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence is a cross Departmental and multi-agency issue, with policy coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also sets out a number of commitments in this area, including an audit on segmentation of DSGBV responsibilities across government departments and agencies, and a Third National Strategy on DSGBV, led by the Department of Justice. The Minister for Justice and I intend to bring an Information Memo to Government next week, providing an update on progress across these strategic actions.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the findings of Tusla's Accommodation Review will inform actions to address shortfalls in emergency accommodation for victims of domestic violence in the Third National Strategy on DSGBV.  I would intend that it would be published in the near future. </p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible. I am committed to ensuring future service provision is evidence based and designed to meet the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600056#WRB01600"><p>The Programme for Government commits to ending the system of Direct Provision. We have pledged to replace it with a new International Protection Support Service (IPSS), which will be centred on a not-for profit approach. As part of this process, I published <i>A White Paper to end Direct Provision and to Establish a new International Protection Support Service</i>on 26 February 2021. We have begun the process of implementing this White Paper which will see Direct Provision ended between now and December 2024. </p><p>This White Paper outlines the proposed system of accommodation and supports that will be offered to applicants for International Protection. It is the result of an extensive consultation process with Civil Society Organisations, residents of Direct Provision centres, and other Government Departments and Bodies. </p><p>We will ensure that protection applicants are helped to integrate into Ireland from day one, with health, housing, education, and employment supports at the core of the new system. As stated in the White Paper, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to have this new system fully operational by December 2024.</p><p>The implementation of the White Paper is in the early stages, with a first draft of a detailed implementation plan currently being drawn up. An Implementation Team is currently being assembled, and engagement and discussions have begun with key implementation partners. </p><p>Much of the progress to date has focused on development of the new accommodation model, and discussions have been held with the Housing Agency on available funding schemes for accommodation in the community and on the role that Approved Housing Bodies will play.</p><p>In addition, the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA) are developing an allocation key on behalf of the Local Authorities, in co-operation with my Department. The allocation key will serve as a guide to how many applicants for International Protection are to be accommodated in each Local Authority area.  I understand that the CCMA will shortly review and discuss a draft of this key with a view to finalising it very soon. </p><p>Work is also underway to establish both a Programme Board and an external Advisory Group, which will form the governance structure for the project as outlined in the White Paper. The membership of the Programme Board will comprise representatives of relevant Departments, Agencies and NGOs. At least one former resident of the Direct Provision system will be represented on the Board, which will also include experts in areas such as housing and change management who will support the delivery of these key areas. I have written to NGOs seeking their nomination of reps and we are in the final stages of putting together the Programme Board&rsquo;s membership.  </p><p>The external Advisory Group will consist of three independent experts who will help to monitor the implementation of the IPSS model and provide independent feedback to Government. I will be announcing details of the individual members of both entities in the coming weeks, and  a first meeting of the Programme Board will take place shortly.</p></reply>

Owing to the nature of the system, scheme-level data on school-age childcare is not captured as a discrete category. However, scheme-level data is available by the age of children. The data I am giving today relates to children aged six years and over. However, since children under the age of six may be in school, the available data is likely to underestimate the actual figures.</p><p>Available data from June this year indicates that 14,304 children aged six years and over are being supported to participate in school-age childcare through schemes offered by my Department. Of these children, 6,461 are in private services, while 7,845 are in community services. </p><p>A breakdown is also available by scheme. There is a very small difference between total figures and scheme-level data because a small number of children are registered to attend more than one service. Of children aged six years and over:</p><p>- 7,345 children are supported through the Community Childcare Scheme. Of these, 3,240 are in private services, while 4,105 are in community services.</p><p>- 6,873 children are supported through the National Childcare Scheme. Of these, 4,552 are in private services, while 2,322 are in community services.</p><p>- A further 17 children are supported through other schemes.</p><p>According to data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile, 14% of services (including both early learning and care and school-age childcare services) are located on school premises, with a slightly higher proportion among community providers (16%) than private (13%). </p></reply>

Tusla's  focus has been  on ensuring continuity of critical supports to vulnerable children and families. </p>  <p>  Managers and staff have managed to balance their work  in line with public health advice to keep children, families and front-line staff as safe as possible. Referrals continued to be screened and assessed, and staff have continued to work with children and families throughout.</p>  <p>  Referrals to Tusla dropped by 36% over the four weeks of the first lock-down in March 2020.  Following a local and national media campaign, referrals increased to over 1,300  a week for the 19 weeks from the mid April 2020 to the end of August 2020. The following 17 weeks since schools re-opened on 24 August 2020 saw a slight further increase in the weekly referrals.  It is of note, that despite the restrictions, Tusla received a larger number of referrals in 2020 than in 2019 and assessments and open cases are in line with numbers from the previous year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks whether referrals have been investigated to the satisfaction of the complainants.</p>  <p>  Due to increasing demand Tusla carries some waiting times in its cases The duty team review these cases regularly and where new information arises, the case may be allocated. A large number of referrals do not meet the threshold for a child protection response but may be referred to family support. Of course, all urgent cases get an immediate response. </p>  <p>  Tusla has developed a robust appeal and complaints facility called 'Tell Us'. For those individuals who are dissatisfied with the service they receive from the option is open to them to make a complaint. </p>  <p>  Details of how to make a complaint, and how complaints are managed can be found on the Tusla website. Information is also available on the escalation pathways available within the Tell Us process.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to commend the staff of Tusla during this period, especially those staff in residential settings, out of hours emergency services and child protection teams. I know that the House will join me in acknowledging the commitment and care of foster carers to children in their care over the past year.</p></reply>

This provision does not exclude former applicants including applicants who pass away while their application is under consideration. This is particularly important to note given that a deceased applicant&rsquo;s family could potentially be in danger in their home country were such information to be published.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly I am unable to comment on any individual cases named in the report other than to note that such commentary on individual deaths may be in breach of the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  In the event of the death of a resident at an IPAS accommodation centre, a critical incident policy is in place, to provide guidelines for staff in the IPAS and accommodation centre managers and staff.  IPAS officials work closely with the centre manager to assist the person&rsquo;s next of kin, if known, in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to offer supports, including counselling, to any residents or centre staff affected by the death.  Where children are involved, the family is linked with Tusla to provide relevant supports.  Assistance with funeral costs is also available through the Department for Social Protection subject to a means test.   </p>  <p>  Under the Critical Incident Policy, any death or very serious incident that occurs within IPAS accommodation centres provided by the Department is referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and, where appropriate, the Garda&iacute; will in turn refer those deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  Where cause of death has not already been certified by a qualified medical practitioner, investigations and inquests into the cause of a death are matters for those authorities.?  Responsibility for the formal registration and recording of all deaths in the State, including information on cause of death where known, rests with the General Register Office in the Department of Social Protection.   </p>  <p>  I can also advise that my Department has developed a new policy on the collation and provision of statistics on our accommodation centres. The policy, which came into effect on 1 June 2021, will be published on a new IPAS website due to launch in coming days.  The policy covers procedures to be followed with regard to notification of a death to IPAS and other relevant authorities, collation of statistics, and publication of information.  Alongside the policy, the Department will also be publishing statistical information on resident deaths going back to the earliest recorded death of a resident.  These statistics, which will include a breakdown by cause of death where known, has been collated with the assistance of the General Register Office. </p></reply>

Tusla is due to provide its finalised Strategic Review of Emergency Domestic Violence Accommodation to my Department shortly. The review will examine the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review will also present recommendations on future configuration of accommodation and services that may be required to holistically meet the needs of victims of DSGBV. I had hoped to receive the review during May but work on completion of the review was interrupted by the Cyberattack on the HSE.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the review, I look forward to engaging with Tusla, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Housing, and other relevant parties on its recommendations and future outcomes.

Owing to the strong demand for funding on this scheme, my officials employed a weighted scoring system as part of the evaluation process.</p><p>One of the key criteria that is measured and scored during this process is <i>Accessibility &amp;amp; Inclusivity</i>; under this criteria we require Local Authorities to indicate how improvements to facilities and equipment for which funding is sought will:</p><p>- improve access/inclusivity to the park/facility for children and young people with additional needs</p><p>- and provide access/inclusivity to the play equipment for all children</p><p>In order for a project to qualify for funding under this scheme, a minimum threshold must be reached on each of the (5) funding criteria (therefore if no consideration is given towards accessibility/inclusivity, the project does not qualify for funding).</p><p>In addition to ensuring all projects take account of accessibility in their project applications, having accessibility included as a funding criteria encourages Local Authorities to include projects for consideration that are primarily geared towards accessibility/inclusivity.

The National Action Plan will involve change and will bring significant benefits for childminders, children and the families using their services.</p>  <p>  While the organisation in question, which represents childminders, temporarily withdrew from processes related to the National Action Plan on 2 June, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that officials in my Department received written confirmation on 5 July that the organisation is now re-engaging in the National Action Plan processes. They have confirmed that they will accept the invitation to take up a seat on the Steering Group for the National Action Plan. The Steering Group is currently in the process of being formed by my Department, in order to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Their agreement to re-engage is very welcome as I believe that active engagement and consultation with childminders and their representatives will be a key to successful implementation of the National Action Plan. To this end, a number of places will also be reserved for childminders themselves on both the Steering Group and the Advisory Groups that will be established to support the Steering Group. (The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and consultation and communications.)</p>  <p>  The organisation's re-engagement follows a number of constructive communications between the organisation and officials in my Department, including meetings on 10 June and 2 July. </p>  <p>  The publication of the National Action Plan was a milestone in Government policy on childminding, putting childminding at the heart of Government policy for the first time.

Where a child needs emergency or long term care Tusla&rsquo;s first priority is to find a family placement and 91% of children in care are in foster care placements. The majority of emergency placements are also provided by specialist foster carers.</p>  <p>  Tusla's has an Out of Hours Emergency Social Work Service and its role is to ensure the safety and welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection outside of normal office hours. The service provides emergency care placements for children as required. </p>  <p>  There were no young people placed by Out of Hours Services in hotel accommodation in 2019. In 2020 eight young people stayed in temporary hotel accommodation accompanied by two care workers.  The total number of hotel nights was 11 at a cost of &euro;4,290.  To date in 2021 ten young people have been placed in hotel accommodation. </p>  <p>  These situations arise where there is no residential vacancy in the immediate area, and older teenager is not suitable for a foster care placement. As it is not appropriate for a young person in this situation to be placed in a hospital or a Garda station, Tusla provides safe overnight accommodation under the supervision of trained staff.  The short length of stay indicates that the young person either goes home, with supports,  or is accommodated in a suitable community setting as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 empowers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS), without a court order, to remove a child urgently from a situation for his or her safety and welfare where the Garda believes there is an immediate or serious risk to the child. Once the child is removed custody of the child is transferred to Tusla.</p>  <p>  A 2017 National University of Ireland, Galway research project reviewed 452 cases, over a year, where AGS transferred children to Tusla&rsquo;s care in such an emergency situation. The biggest cohort of the children were aged 15 to 17 years, slightly more boys than girls and the most common reported reasons for invoking Section 12 were:</p>  <p>  - Severe parenting Difficulties (103)</p>  <p>  - Parental Alcohol/Drug Abuse (88)</p>  <p>  - Child Behaviour Difficulties (72).</p>  <p>  As the data was collected in 2016/2017 many of the findings of the report, and subsequent recommendations, have been addressed through ongoing service development and improvements in Tusla. The findings of the report are being considered as part of the review of the Child Care Act 1991. </p>  <p>  There are strategic plans to increase Tusla capacity in Children&rsquo;s residential services.  </p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises the need for additional refuge spaces and has committed to an action plan on this issue. Tusla is due to provide its finalised Strategic Review of Emergency Domestic Violence Accommodation to my Department shortly. It will examine the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review will also present recommendations on future configuration of accommodation and services that may be required to holistically meet the needs of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the review, I look forward to engaging with Tusla, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Housing, and other relevant parties on its recommendations and future outcomes. I am not in a position to advise on a publication date before these initial engagements. It remains my priority to ensure that the evolving needs of service users are met, and that the recommendations of the review inform strategic actions in the Third National Strategy on DSGBV.</p>  <p>  With regard to a second report that the Deputy has not referred to by name, I surmise that the Deputy is referring to an audit report that was commissioned by the Department of Justice, with regard to the segmentation of responsibility for DSGBV matters across Government bodies. The Programme for Government provided for this audit. My Department and Tusla assisted the Department of Justice in the tendering process for the audit. I understand the Minister for Justice will provide information shortly to relevant stakeholders about the publication of the report of the audit. The Minister for Justice and I will be jointly providing an update to Government on a number of DSGBV matters covered by the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

While a range of views have been expressed in reaction to the Commission&rsquo;s Final Report, it is important to emphasise that the Commission was entirely independent in the performance of its functions and this independence was guaranteed in law. </p>  <p>  It was a matter for the Commission alone to reach whatever conclusions it deemed possible based on its assessment of the wide range of evidence available to it, including through the work of the Confidential Committee. </p>  <p>  Following submission of the Commission's final report, I met with Judge Murphy and Professor Daly in advance of bringing the report to Government, primarily to acknowledge the completion of their significant inquiry process.  I was also in contact with the Commissioners earlier this year in an effort to establish the facts relating to the status of audio recordings of witness testimonies. It is a matter of record that the audio tapes were subsequently recovered.  The tapes are now held by my Department and are accessible to individuals who seek access to their personal information in the archive under GDPR.</p>  <p>  In terms of witness evidence, the value of the work of the Confidential Committee should not be underestimated. Its report is an essential element of the Commission&rsquo;s final report &ndash; giving a window into the trauma and grief which has blighted the lives of vulnerable mothers and their children. I commend those who were so brave to come forward and take part in this process. It is not correct to say that these narratives were &ldquo;discounted&rdquo; or &ldquo;discarded&rdquo;. It has been confirmed that they were taken into account, and relied upon, by the Commission in making its determination on crucial questions. The Commission also examined many thousands of records related to adoption.</p>  <p>  I fully understand the disappointment which some feel in relation to how their personal narratives have been relayed within the Confidential Committee report. I am conscious of the need for the lived experiences of those who attended the Confidential Committee, and other survivors, to be officially recognised as part of our history. I am exploring mechanisms to achieve this, and would hope to engage with survivors, in this regard.</p></reply>

I was gladdened at the overwhelming support shown to us by the people of Wexford and Wexford County Council. I have no doubt that Carlow locals would give us the same reception. We were joined in Wexford by young LGBTI+ creators, activists, sportspeople and artists, who showed the nation what a difference it makes for LGBTI+ young people to be able to live openly, freely expressing their true selves. I am encouraging everyone to watch this celebratory event that is available on the RTE Player and join us in celebrating the LGBTI+ youth of Ireland. The Department of Education (DoE) supported the Live Out Loud campaign and event and was represented on a working group to deliver this celebration.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains one of the very few countries that have developed a national Strategy to support LGBTI+ young people.  The Department of Education was represented on the Oversight Committee that developed the National LGBTI+ Youth Strategy in 2018, a cross-Government strategy led by my Department. Full implementation of this strategy has been one of my key priorities.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Education and others to implement the Strategy and to create a safe, supportive and inclusive environment in schools and colleges throughout the country and across society for every LGBTI+ young person. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education is committed to implementing a number of actions under the Strategy including encouraging schools to develop a whole-school policy to include LGBTI+ young people and explore ways to include LGBTI+ lives in the curriculum. It is also encouraging schools to participate in the roll out of the LGBTI+ Welcome Sticker campaign, an initiative that was originally intended for business and youth centres.</p>  <p>  In April, the Department of Education published a new School Design Guide for sanitary facilities representing a significant review of the design guidance to ensure ease of access for all, including LGBTI+ young people.</p>  <p>  It also provides annual funding to BeLonG To for the annual Stand Up! Campaign in secondary schools. This campaign provides schools with an opportunity to look at how they can make them safe and supportive places for LGBTI+ students, a key element of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  My own Department also provides funding to BeLonG To for a range of training for professionals including teachers, as well as for their youth services. We also fund ShoutOut, a charity committed to improving life for LGBTI+ people by educating school students, parents and teachers. ShoutOut delivers workshops in secondary schools, which tackle LGBTI+ bullying.</p>  <p>  I am very happy to welcome the various collaborations between my Department and the Department of Education. The outcomes of actions under the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy will be reported on later this year.</p></reply>

Providers can use this funding either to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member. This staff member works alongside other staff to provide early learning and care for all children in the pre-school room. </p>  <p>  The Early Years Services Regulations (S.I. No. 221/2016) require that all staff who are employed by an early learning and care provider and who work directly with children of pre-school age must hold, at a minimum, a major award at level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework (NFQ) in Early Childhood Care and Education or an equivalent qualification </p>  <p>  The December 2016 amendment to the Regulations (S.I. No. 632/2016) provided for exceptional cases in which an exemption from the Level 5 requirement may be made for children with specific needs in the context of AIM. An example of a relevant situation is where a child with complex healthcare needs requires specialised health supports, such as nursing, in order to attend the pre-school.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator of pre-school services, has published a Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF), which specifies how the Regulations will be interpreted by the Early Years Inspectorate. The QRF (section 2, paragraph 6) specifies that exemption under AIM from the qualification requirement requires an exemption letter from Pobal.</p>  <p>  This requirement for an exemption letter from Pobal is also specified in the Funding Agreement for the ECCE programme, which states, with reference to the Level 5 minimum qualification requirement, that "In exceptional cases, an exemption may be made under AIM, wherein a child with medically complex needs who is availing of AIM Level 7 requires specialised health supports, for example healthcare assistant or nursing care. An exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and this may detail the qualification requirements or relevant specialist training of the staff member involved."</p>  <p>  As these cases are exceptional, the majority of AIM workers are still required to hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework, as set out in S.I. No. 221/2016.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, I secured an additional &euro;61M for the Agency in 2021. This brings the total budget of the Agency to &euro;878M.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s Child Protection and Welfare Strategy 2017-2022 outlines its strategic vision to provide an appropriate, proportionate and timely response to children at risk or in need of support in Ireland. Similarly its business plan and corporate strategy are all orientated to improve services, including those for children in care. </p>  <p>  Tusla has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Tusla assesses all child protection and welfare concerns that are reported to it. If it is found that a child is not receiving adequate care and protection, Tusla has a duty to take appropriate action to promote the welfare of the child. This may include supporting families in need of assistance in providing care and protection to their children. The Child Care Act also sets out the statutory framework for taking children into care if necessary. Tusla received approximately 60,000 referrals of concern in 2020. Many of these concerns are best served by a family support approach while some children need the direct intervention of a child protection approach. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 to remove a child from a situation of danger and, under Section 13, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla provides an Out of Hours Service (OHS) and Emergency Out of Hours Service (EOHS) to ensure the safety and welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection outside of normal office hours. The Service provides support and assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and foster carers outside of regular business hours. The service also provides emergency care placements for children as required. A growing feature of this services is where parents of older children, aged 15 and 16, seek assistance with their children outside of office hours. </p>  <p>  Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs. Ideally this is with foster carers in the communities in which they live. Social workers recruit foster carers on an ongoing basis and Tusla places over 91% of children in care in foster placements.  </p>  <p>  A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care, and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  Services provided by Tusla are subject to internal reviews and audits and are also the subject of HIQA inspections in relation to Child Protection Services, Foster Care Services, Special Care and Tusla run Children's Residential Centres. This monitoring of provided services ensures issues that are identified can be addressed and the quality of service is maintained or improved. In addition, the Ombudsman for Children and Tusla&rsquo;s own National Review Panel will report on specific topics relating to the work of Tusla which prompts further improvements in Tusla services.  </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic and current effects of the cyber-attack of Friday 14 May 2021 Tusla has continued to provide essential child protection services and services to children in care. </p>  <p>  Tusla and my Department have taken numerous steps to respond to the public health crisis including increasing the number of foster carers through the implementation of emergency measures that allow swift recruitment and approval of foster carers and suspending a requirement to allow for more than two unrelated children to be placed with approved foster carers, if necessary.</p>  <p>  The recent cyber-attack on HSE IT systems has also impacted on Tusla&rsquo;s operations. However, it continues to provide a full range of services and supports, with social workers and social care workers around the country continuing their core work with children and families, supported by manual systems. Priority is being accorded to Child Protection and Children in Care Services (including assessment of risk). While the referrals portal for this service is impacted, referrals are being taken via phone and post and anyone with a concern is being asked to contact their local duty social work office. Contact details are available on Tusla's website at www.tusla.ie/about/ict-update/</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Information System (NCCIS) has recently been restored; this is a significant step in recovering from the cyberattack.</p>  <p>  I trust the points above give some clarification on how my Department and agencies under its remit continue to improve and evolve services provided for the protection of children.</p></reply>

As part of this process, I published <i>A White Paper to end Direct Provision and to Establish a new International Protection Support Service</i>on 26 February 2021. This White Paper outlines the proposed system of accommodation and supports that will be offered to applicants for International Protection and is the result of an extensive consultation process with Civil Society Organisations, residents of Direct Provision centres, and other Government Departments and Bodies. IPSS will ensure that protection applicants are helped to integrate into Ireland from day one, with health, housing, education, and employment supports at the core of the new system. As stated in the White Paper, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to have this new system fully operational by December 2024.</p><p>The implementation of the White Paper is in the early stages, with a first draft of a detailed implementation plan currently being drawn up. An Implementation Team is currently being assembled and engagement and discussions have begun with certain implementation partners. Much of the progress to date has focused on development of the new accommodation model, and discussions have been held with the Housing Agency on available funding schemes for accommodation in the community and the role that Approved Housing Bodies will play. In addition, the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA) are developing an allocation key on behalf of the Local Authorities, in co-operation with my Department. The allocation key will serve as a guide as to how many applicants for International Protection are to be accommodated in each Local Authority area, and a draft of this key is to be discussed during an upcoming meeting of the CCMA. </p><p>Work is also underway to establish both a Programme Board and an external Advisory Group, which will form the governance structure for the project as outlined in the White Paper. The membership of the Programme Board will comprise representatives of relevant Departments, Agencies and NGOs. At least one former resident of the Direct Provision system will be represented on the Board, which will also include experts in areas such as housing and change management who will support the delivery of these key areas. The external Advisory Group will consist of three independent experts who will help to monitor the implementation of the IPSS model and provide independent feedback to Government. I will be announcing details of the individual members of both entities in the coming weeks, and it is envisaged that a first meeting of the Programme Board will take place shortly.</p></reply>

My Department allocates core funding for the FRC Programme and, since 2019, an additional &euro;1.5m has been provided in funding, which has meant that yearly funding has amounted to &euro;18m for this programme. </p>  <p>  Organisations that wish to join the Programme are advised to contact Tusla in the first instance, with regard to potential next steps.  There are no plans to expand the FRC Programme or to establish new funding schemes for the Programme in the immediate future. Any such plans would depend on the availability of additional funding for the Programme, and decisions on the most appropriate use of such funding within the Programme. Tusla does not have a capital funding allocation to fund the building of new FRCs.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to make a statement or commitment at this time, regarding funding for the FRC or other individual programme areas, but this will be given full consideration in the upcoming Estimates process. My Department officials and I will work closely with Tusla and with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure that the Agency and the services it provides, both directly and through funded organisations, including Family Resource Centres, receive adequate funding in the coming year.</p></reply>

Seasonal employees may build up the requisite service required for statutory redundancy notwithstanding that they may work only for a number of months in the year.</p>  <p>  In the case of seasonal workers who are laid off for an average period of more than twelve weeks per year prior to redundancy, the provisions relating to lay-off will not apply until the end of that average period. Therefore, there will normally be no question of redundancy until the usual commencement time of an employee&rsquo;s seasonal work. If an employee is not then re-employed, the question of redundancy arises, but not until then.</p>  <p>  Currently, an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer following certain periods of lay-off or short time work due to Covid-19 is temporarily suspended by the emergency provision, Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. This suspension has recently been extended to 30 September 2021.</p>  <p>  This decision to extend the provision was a difficult one for Government to make.  However, as the public health situation is not yet resolved and restrictions are being eased on a gradual basis, many businesses will continue to be impacted by restrictions for some period of time.</p>  <p>  Reinstating the entitlement for employees to claim redundancy before the end of September 2021 would have a serious impact on the potential for a business to recover and push many into insolvency situations, exacerbate employment losses and delay economic recovery.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is the organisation mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation. The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service and Information Unit can provide workers with further information on their employment rights and their employer&rsquo;s obligations in respect of redundancy.</p>  <p>  I understand the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office issued a detailed response in relation to this matter to the Deputy this week.</p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.   </p>  <p>  Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work.

As part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Architecture, the EGFSN helps inform the work of the National Skills Council, which advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and the allocation of resources across the education and training system to address these needs.</p><p>Over the past five years the EGFSN has undertaken a range of studies relevant to the biopharma, medtech, information and communications technology and foodtech manufacturing sectors in Ireland. These studies have been informed by comprehensive engagement and consultation across Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base, including with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and their client companies.</p><p>These studies have included 2016&rsquo;s <i>Future Skills Needs of the Biopharma Industry in Ireland</i>; 2017&rsquo;s <i>Update on Future Skills Needs in the Food and Drink Sector</i>, developed in support of the Foodwise 2025 strategy; and 2018&rsquo;s <i>Addressing the Skills Needs Arising from the Potential Trade Implications of Brexit,</i>which examined the trade diversification and logistics related skills needs of a number of sectors, including Agri-Food and Health Lifesciences, in a hard Brexit scenario.</p><p>The EGFSN has also played a key role in the ICT Skills Action Plan process, since the inception of the Plans in 2012. Its latest High Level ICT Skills study, 2019&rsquo;s <i>Forecasting the Demand for High Level ICT Skills in Ireland, 2017-2022</i>, was a key evidence based input into the development of <i>Technology Skills 2022- Ireland&rsquo;s Third ICT Skills Action Plan. </i>The EGFSN has further supported the ICT skills agenda through its studies on design skills- 2017&rsquo;s <i>Winning by Design </i>and 2020&rsquo;s <i>Together for Design. </i></p><p>More generally, 2020&rsquo;s <i>Leading the Way- Investing in Management Development for SME Productivity and Growth </i>examined the area of management development, a key cross sectoral skill need. It has also examined the skills impacts of digitalisation across all sectors of the economy, in 2018&rsquo;s<i>Digital Transformation- Assessing the Impact of Digitalisation on Ireland&rsquo;s Workforce. </i></p><p>As part of its 2021 work programme, the Group is also considering the skills required to deploy, manage and regulate artificial intelligence, with a view to realising the productivity, growth and innovation potential of AI, to ensure it is adopted in a trustworthy manner, and to allow its adoption by large and small firms. This study is scheduled to be published in Q4 2021.</p></reply>

Over the last decade the manufacturing sector has been undergoing a radical transformation through the adoption of a range of digital technology platforms, collectively referred to as Industry 4.0. This includes robotics, additive manufacturing, cyber security, artificial intelligence and next-generation communications technology such as 5G. The resilience of the manufacturing sector is of critical importance to maintaining a competitive economy and therefore the uptake and adoption of digital technologies in manufacturing has been a key focus of the Government. </p>  <p>  To address and manage the digital transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing sector there have been a number of substantial investments by the Government to support the digitisation of the sector and to develop Advanced Manufacturing competency so that investments in digital technologies can result in tangible impact to businesses. These investments are being made by my Department and underpinned by investments through the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. </p>  <p>  In the area of research and development, these investments include two Science Foundation Ireland centres, iForm and Confirm, focussed on research, and Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Technology Centre: Irish Manufacturing Research focussed on innovation. IDA Ireland is also preparing for the launch of an Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Limerick as a national facility focussed on deployment of manufacturing technology at scale. </p>  <p>There have also been substantial investments delivered by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland through a range of grant mechanisms to support the implementation of digital technologies as well as the training and upskilling of the workforce. This includes projects in the area of Advanced Manufacturing supported by the Government&rsquo;s &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund delivered through my Department. </p>  <p>  In the area of skills for Advanced Manufacturing, my Department is working closely with DFHERIS to align education and training provision with the skills needs arising from digital transformation. Investments in this area include the digital upskilling EXPLORE programme, delivered by the Regional Skills Fora for workers in manufacturing, SOLAS&rsquo;s Skills to Advance for lower skilled workers, and the subsidised programmes offered through Springboard+ and Skillnet Ireland, with a focus on the future of work in areas like blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, virtual reality and smart factory technologies.</p>  <p>  The investments to support the digitisation of the manufacturing sector have also been encompassed by the ambitious Industry 4.0 Strategy launched by my Department in January 2020. A key strategic action of the Industry 4.0 Strategy is the creation of a new coordination mechanism - Future Manufacturing Ireland (FMI). This will ensure coordination of the key supports to the manufacturing sector as well as coherence concerning access to technological resources and funding. Importantly, FMI will ensure that support exists for companies to access a range of resources from fundamental research to applied technology deployment at scale. This will cater for the breath of the manufacturing sector from start-ups and the SME base to large multinational companies and will span all levels of technical maturity appropriately.  </p>  <p>  Reflecting the importance of the digital transition for Ireland in the coming decade, Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan includes a programme to drive Digital Transformation of Enterprise in Ireland to support digitalisation including the establishment of a number of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) in Ireland. The investment will support initiatives such as developing online presence; digitalisation of products and business processes; and using digital technologies to develop new markets and business models. The EDIHs shall further help companies undertake the digital transformation and become more competitive.</p>  <p>  The global pandemic has brought into focus a renewed and accelerated impetus to embrace Digitisation to drive operational efficiencies, create robust supply chains and to contribute to sustainability targets.  Through a range of Government investments, including those outlined above, I am satisfied that we are embracing the challenges and the opportunities presented by the digital transformation on manufacturing.</p></reply>

The  HSA has confirmed that this investigation is ongoing rather than having  been concluded, the Authority does not comment on  inspections and/or investigations concerning individual employers or workplaces.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests in the first instance with the employer, the workers and their representatives. I would encourage employers and worker representatives including Trade Unions to fully engage with each other on any issues of concern in the workplace especially issues around workplace health and safety.</p>  <p>  The State does provide the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms i.e. the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to support Parties in their efforts to resolve differences which arise in the workplace from time to time. I would urge all parties to engage constructively with the State's industrial relations machinery in order to resolve any issues in dispute where such issues are not resolved at a local level.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, it should be noted that following a request, the HSA recently met with trade union representatives, during which matters regarding health and safety in docks was raised and discussed.</p></reply>

On 18 May, the Government's Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas was published.  </p>  <p>  The policy statement provides that pending the outcome of a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems being carried out by my Department, it would not be appropriate for the development of any Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with.  Consequently this will mean that gas fired power stations will not use gas which is sourced from imported fracked LNG.</p>  <p>  The review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050.

The review, once completed, will be submitted to Government.</p>  <p>  The Government Policy Statement was notified to An Bord Plean&aacute;la following its approval by Government. It was not considered necessary to notify other planning authorities as LNG facilities are considered strategic infrastructure developments and therefore any planning application would be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p>  <p>  Section 34 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act requires An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of an area with regard being had to relevant Government policies such as the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas. </p></reply>

This popular scheme supports partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types including public, commercial and community buildings with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits and support Climate Action Plan objectives. </p>  <p>  A range of improvements to the scheme have been introduced over the last year following feedback from Sustainable Energy Communities (SECs) and the wider supply chain.  The 2021 scheme budget has been significantly increased; the &euro;30 million allocation for this year represents a 50% increase on the 2020 budget and demand for the scheme has been very strong.</p>  <p>  The difficulties associated with delivering CEG projects within the applicable timelines is an issue that has been raised by stakeholders previously.  In acknowledgement of this challenge, the SEAI issued its most recent call for projects a number of months earlier than previous years and the evaluation period for applications was significantly shortened.  These changes meant that project approvals issued from December thereby significantly extending the timescale for works under the scheme.  Unfortunately, enhanced COVID restrictions between January and April and the associated pause in the construction sector meant that much of the planned work was delayed. These delays were clearly outside of the control of the Department and SEAI.  However, every effort has been made to maximise activity since the construction sector recommenced and further initiatives to help the supply chain with this issue and facilitate year-round retrofit works are in development.</p>  <p>  Other changes to enhance the scheme have been made based on feedback from stakeholders.  For example, the administrative burden for SECs associated with applying for Energy Master Plans has been significantly reduced by streamlining seven different application elements into one single application. SEAI has also developed Memoranda of Understanding with most Local Authorities to allow the cashflowing of energy masterplan costs for communities.  Under this arrangement, with the involvement of Local Authorities, SECs no longer have to pay the costs of the energy masterplan in advance of drawing down the grant funding.             </p>  <p>  My Department and the SEAI also recognise the issues associated with assessment costs that arise when a homeowner decides not to proceed with a home energy upgrade.  Options to deal with these costs are being considered as part of the development of new support schemes to be launched later this year.  In the meantime, it should be noted that the SEAI also funds the aforementioned Energy Masterplans to help communities to identify blocks of suitable homes which are then a clear target for upgrades.  The SEAI also published a national BER database which is available to SECs to help them to create a general assessment of the BER ratings of homes in their community and cut down on some pre assessment costs.</p>  <p>  In relation to the requirement for multiple measures under the scheme, as indicated in the scheme guidelines, the CEG scheme is designed for bundled measures and a minimum BER uplift of 100 kWh/m&sup2;/yr applies. Homes that require single measures only are directed to the Better Energy Homes grant scheme because it is more suited to their needs and allows the homeowner more time and involves less administration to make an application.   </p>  <p>  Regarding window replacement, there is a provision in the scheme guidelines to facilitate a process whereby the Project Co-ordinators can agree the measures to be covered in advance with the SEAI team.  In cases where windows that are fit for purpose and all windows in a home do not need to be replaced this can be accommodated and a commensurate reduction of the grant amount would apply.   </p>  <p>  Consultation with Communities and learning from valuable programme feedback is always encouraged by my Department and welcomed by SEAI at all levels.  I am informed that at the most recent meeting (23 June, 2021) between SEAI and the SEC referred to by the Deputy, all relevant matters were discussed in detail.  SEAI will consider the feedback fully.  SEAI will also continue to work with the SEC and the wider sector to further develop and enhance the support schemes. </p>  <p>  Separately from the CEG scheme, my Department is currently working with the SEAI to develop a new support scheme aimed at community projects focusing specifically on SECs and growing their capacity to co-ordinate projects. The new scheme will be open for applications later this year and is being informed by feedback and consultations with SECs.</p></reply>

The SEAI accepts applications for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme from eligible homeowners year-round and operates independently of other SEAI schemes. Applicants to the Warmer Homes Scheme do not need to re-apply or restart the cycle after a given period of time.  </p>  <p>  SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months.  COVID-19 related restrictions negatively impacted activity between March and June of 2020 as well as between January and April of 2021, when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government COVID-19 guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather. </p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to households under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020. </p>  <p>  A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes in 2021. Of this amount, &euro;109 million is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the Warmer Homes work programme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 public health restrictions on construction activity in 2020 and between January and April 2021 of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  Individual applications to the Warmer Homes Scheme are an operational matter for the SEAI and as Minister I have no role in such matters. However in reference to the case raised by the Deputy, I have been informed by the SEAI that the completed application for the home in question was received on 3rd February 2020 and is currently awaiting a survey allocation. </p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget allocation, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 July, over 230,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Westmeath in Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. Pre-works have commenced in the areas around Mullingar. Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally).  Covid 19 as affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The full extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in so far as possible.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 1 July, 326 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Whitehall Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Ballycomoyle GAA Club and Clonkill Hurling Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride and Naomh Micheal have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to households under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.  A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes in 2021. Of this amount, &euro;109 million is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. </p><p>SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 public health restrictions on construction activity in 2020 and between January and April 2021 of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have recommenced since 12<sup>th</sup>April in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p><p>The following table sets out the amount of grant funding paid out under the scheme for homes in Wexford in 2020 and to end May 2021: <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>To end-May 2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>&euro; 981,352 </td>       <td>&euro; 348,168</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In line with the published eligibility criteria, all funding related to applicants that own and live in their own home.</p><p>It is important to note that in addition to the increased budget allocation this year, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme.</p></reply>

It is a cross-Governmental initiative, led by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). The final report of the Taskforce published in December 2016, addressed a wide range of issues impacting on broadband and mobile service provision. </p>  <p>  An Implementation Group was established in early 2017 to oversee timely implementation of all of the actions contained in the Taskforce Report, and brought together all key stakeholders including: Department of Transport, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Local Government Management Agency, County and City Management Association, Commission for Communications Regulation (in an independent advisory capacity), Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, ESB Networks, Office of Public Works, Ibec (Telecommunications Industry Ireland) and ALTO, representing the telecommunications industry.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, the Taskforce has addressed over 70 targeted actions, focusing on issues that are negatively impacting upon the rollout of essential telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas. Key achievements of the Taskforce have included: </p>  <p>  - Over 1,000 km of ducting installed nationwide, enabling operators to expand their networks along the road network route. </p>  <p>  - Broadband Officers in all local authorities engaging with operators and State agencies to remove obstacles to infrastructure deployment and raising local awareness of digital skills schemes. </p>  <p>  - The revision of the Guidelines for Managing Openings in Public Roads (the &lsquo;Purple Book&rsquo;) and support provided by the Road Management Office, resulting in improved management of road works by utilities and local authorities.</p>  <p>  - Removal of development contributions and the introduction of planning exemptions for new telecoms technology, enabling infrastructure rollout where previously not considered viable. </p>  <p>  - A single centralised process and online resource for road opening licences to facilitate deployment. </p>  <p>  - Publication by ComReg of a composite national outdoor coverage map to inform consumers and assist them in choosing the best operator for where they live and work.</p>  <p>  - The launch of a series of pilot projects nationwide to tackle blackspots.</p>  <p>  - Development of new advertising guidelines to ensure that certain marketing terms used by telecommunications operators convey clear meanings that are not misleading to consumers.</p>  <p>  One of the most positive aspects to emerge from the work of the Taskforce is the extent to which practical cooperation between State agencies and Industry has developed. This has been fundamental to achieving tangible results which have delivered &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo; improvements in services for citizens and business. The value captured through these collaborative relationships and structures will be carried forward and further strengthened under the future Work Programme of the Taskforce which my Department is finalising in consultation with the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p></reply>

A summary report of the submissions received has now been published on my Department's website.While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. Intensive work is underway with a view to achieving transposition of the Directive into Irish law as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will publish a draft framework later this year which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee payment for exported renewable electricity from micro-generators.</p>  <p>  The CRU is also leading on co-ordinating the National Smart Metering Programme, and is working with ESB Networks in delivering the electricity meter rollout on a phased basis. Since the rollout commenced in September 2019, over 319,000 meters have been installed to the end of May 2021. ESB Networks are working with customers, electricity supply companies and other industry stakeholders to upgrade meters for customers who have informed them that they have installed micro-generation, which can be done by submitting an NC6 form to ESB Networks.

With no meaningful business since March 2020, I understand the cash flow pressure that travel agents and tour operators are under, and I recognise that many are small family businesses doing the best for their customers.</p>  <p>  The main sector-specific response to date was the Refund Credit Note Scheme, introduced last year to help protect liquidity in the face of the legal requirements imposed by the Package Travel Directive. Notes to the value of &euro;17m have been issued. This is money that otherwise would have had to be paid by the sector at the height of the crisis to cover customer refunds at a time that their onward suppliers were not releasing refunds. However I understand the situation in respect to suppliers has regularised in recent months. </p>  <p>  Travel agents and tour operators have also availed of central Government supports such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) which fall under the remit of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment respectively. These schemes have  undoubtedly helped sustain employment in the sector.</p>  <p>  While the planned reopening of international travel from July 19th is welcomed by the sector, my Department is maintaining ongoing close engagement with the industry, in particular through contacts with the Irish Travel Agents Association, as we await to see the level of recovery of travel.</p></reply>

This includes the Online Motor Tax service at www.motortax.ie which enables vehicle owner&rsquo;s tax their vehicle over the internet. The online service integrates with Payment Service Providers (PSP&rsquo;s) as part of the operation of the service itself.</p>  <p>   The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) of 2015 introduced strong security requirements for the initiation and processing of electronic payments, which apply to all PSP&rsquo;s. PSPs are obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA under PSD2 requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. SCA is a combination of something you know (a password or PIN), something you have (a card reader or token generator) and something you are (a fingerprint). SCA is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments). SCA requirements under PSD2 were mandatory by 31 December 2020.   My colleague the Minister for Finance is responsible for Ireland's compliance with the Payment Services Directives.</p>  <p>  My Department's online motor tax website is fully compliant with the PSD2 SCA requirements and this involves capturing additional information on the cardholder during the payment process itself, and this information being subsequently shared with the cardholder's bank. The cardholder's bank will validate this against the data they have for the cardholder and determine if the cardholder needs further authentication when processing their transaction, and if so, what that authentication will entail. The changes have not had any adverse impact on the service itself, with just under 1.9m online tax discs issued for January to May 2021, compared to just over 1.8m for the same period in 2020, an increase of 5%. The online service represents 90% of overall motor tax transactions for this period, compared to 85% for the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Along with retailers, it is however important to note that the new requirements themselves have some immediate implications for cardholders themselves. That extra layer of security is meant to protect both cardholders and retailers from fraudulent payments, but it also makes shopping online a little more complex. Cardholders may in some cases have to make appropriate security arrangements such as providing their phone number to their bank for SMS authentication etc. Any cardholder issues my officials have encountered to date have in the main been in relation to this, and have required referring the cardholder back to their bank for assistance. My officials are however continually monitoring the new requirements, and have engaged with the financial institutions directly to assist with any such queries where possible. </p></reply>

This is underpinned by the provisions of the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013.  The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance. </p>  <p>  The current procedures, only allowing for a future declaration of non-use, have been fully in force since 1st October 2013.  Under the revised procedures, an owner can indicate that a vehicle is going to be off the road by making a declaration of non-use at any time in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use. The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months.  If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle, either online or through a motor tax office.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, motor tax must be paid for a minimum of 3 months, along with any arrears of motor tax, where applicable. </p>  <p>  An automated response issues in response to emails to motortax@transport.gov.ie ( motortax@dttas.gov.ie in April 2020).  This response sets out links to information on www.motortax.ie in respect of the most frequently queries to the mailbox, including the procedures for declaring a vehicle off the road and setting out the position where a declaration is not made in advance.   The response also advises that a follow-up email should be sent where the initial response does not address the query raised.  </p>  <p>  Motor tax legislation does not provide for exemptions in individual cases. You will appreciate the difficulties in providing for exemptions in particular cases, given that other people have had to pay arrears in motor tax where the Declaration of Non-use of a Motor Vehicle was not made on time, and the necessity generally of maintaining a consistent approach in the application of the legislation.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.  This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.</p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening. </p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is   computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.  The BRSS will come into operation from early September.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p>  <p>The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

These contract notifications provide Revenue with information regarding the contract between the principal and the subcontractor. Prior to the principal submitting a contract notification to Revenue, the principal is obliged to seek and retain proof of identity from the subcontractor. The contract notification must include the subcontractor&rsquo;s name and tax reference number or where the tax reference number is not known, the subcontractor&rsquo;s contact information, including the subcontractor&rsquo;s address, phone number and email address. The contract notification also requires information regarding the contractual relationship between the principal and the subcontractor, to ensure that it is not one of employer-employee. Details in relation to the contract itself must also be provided, including the sector involved, nature of work, site identification number, start date and end date and the value of the contract.  </p>  <p>  Details supplied by principals regarding subcontractors enables Revenue to monitor that subcontractors are registered with Revenue and are complying with their tax obligations.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that the introduction of the online RCT system in 2012 has reduced the administrative burden, for both principals and subcontractors, associated with RCT. This was facilitated by the online system tailoring information requests based on the circumstances of each contract. The electronic system has reduced tax fraud in the sectors that come within RCT and has also increased the tax compliance of subcontractors.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy has been interested in the employment/self-employment status of workers in the construction sector and there is an onus on principal contractors to ensure the status of sub-contractors when engaging them. While the documentation provided by the Deputy is not prescribed by Revenue, some of the information is required to comply with the online RCT system. The balance of the information may be relevant to Health and Safety and contractual details.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, the Government understands the concerns felt by many groups, including the arborist sector, regarding the cost and availability of insurance.  Accordingly, insurance reform is high on the Government agenda. In this regard, the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. The Plan is ambitious, with 95% of actions due to be completed in 2021, and work is continuing across several Government departments to deliver these key reforms.</p><p>I would note that significant progress has been made on the reform agenda. Of note is the adoption of new personal injuries guidelines. These have reduced awards and I now expect that premiums will decline as a consequence. It is something I have impressed in my bilateral engagements with the insurance industry over recent months.</p><p>Another significant achievement has been the creation of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>within the Department of Finance. The role of the Office, which I chair, is twofold: to assist in reducing insurance costs, and increasing the availability of cover, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. The Office has held a number of meetings with several key stakeholders, including representatives of civic society, to discuss important matters regarding reducing cost, consumer empowerment and increasing the provision of relevant information. </p><p>The Office is also working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve its overall competitiveness. In conjunction with the IDA, my officials are developing a customised proposal for potential new market entrants and are identifying a shortlist of specific targets to engage intensively with. This proposal will, in the first instance, target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market.</p><p>I would like to add that we are already seeing the insurance industry respond positively to our reform progress with the announcement recently by some specialist providers that they will expand their footprint in Ireland. This should help ease the capacity issues particularly in the professional indemnity market, which has been prominent in recent years.</p><p>Finally, it is my firm belief that ongoing work across Government to deliver the remaining elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care, will help more companies to expand their product lines or enter into the Irish market. This, in turn, will lower the insurance costs for customers across all sectors. </p></reply>

The scheme ended on 30 April.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 66,725 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 1 July 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;10,036,454, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,207,291, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   </p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.  </p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme.  However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:</p>  <p>  - In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It was originally to apply until 31 December 2021. However, the reduced rate will be extended to 1 September 2022. The extension until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. </p>  <p>  - In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. </p>  <p>  - The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.</p>  <p>  - The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that the provision I introduced in 2020 does already apply the temporary 9% VAT rate to admission fees for cinemas, theatres and musical performances.

Under the EU VAT Directive it is not permissible to differentiate between the supply of different types of residential property, such as apartments and housing, for the purpose of applying VAT rates. Nor is it possible to change the VAT rate for first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  While most Member states apply the standard rate to construction services, Ireland already applies a 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the supply of building materials is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Member states are not permitted to apply a VAT rate lower than the standard rate to building materials. However, Ireland by way of derogation from the general rule is permitted to continue to apply a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks. </p>  <p>  Property developers charge VAT on sales of developed residential property at the 13.5% rate but are entitled to recover the VAT incurred in the development of that property, including VAT on building materials.

This package, NextGenerationEU, is Europe&rsquo;s shared response to the severe health and economic crisis caused by COVID-19. It is an ambitious and common recovery package that will complement and support each country&rsquo;s own national response to the crisis. At the heart of the package lies the Recovery and Resilience Facility. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Facility is to address the economic and social impact of the pandemic and make European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the green and digital transitions. Ireland will receive approximately &euro;915 million in grants from the Facility relating to the years 2021 and 2022. A further set of grants is to be allocated in 2023, taking into account economic developments between now and then. All of these grants will be used to support investments between now and mid-2026.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility, each Member State must prepare a National Recovery and Resilience Plan. On 28 May 2021, Ireland submitted its draft Plan to the European Commission. Ireland&rsquo;s draft Plan takes into account the requirements of the Facility for a minimum of 37% of expenditure on climate and 20% on digital investments and reforms; the need to address investment and reform challenges identified in all or a significant subset of relevant Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) made to Ireland by the EU in recent years; and the importance of alignment with national economic and investment plans, in particular the Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  The overall objective of Ireland&rsquo;s Plan is to contribute to a sustainable, equitable, green and digital recovery effort, in a manner that complements and supports the Government&rsquo;s broader recovery efforts. Ireland has committed to addressing issues highlighted in recent Country Specific Recommendations as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan. </p>  <p>  A number of reform projects are set out in the draft National Recovery and Resilience Plan. These include progressing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill; implementation of Base Broadening Carbon Tax measures; Addressing the Digital Divide and Enhancing Digital Skills by developing a new 10 year Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy and a new Digital Strategy for schools; Reducing Regulatory Barriers to Entrepreneurship through the use of an SME Test in development of policy; Enhancing Ireland's Anti-Money Laundering Capacity; continuing to address Aggressive Tax Planning; Advancing supplementary pension provision reform; Increasing the provision of social and affordable housing through progressing the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill; and, progressing Sl&aacute;intecare implementation by committing to the implementation of three initiatives which will improve access to care in the community and help the process of removing private healthcare from public hospitals.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, and as previously signalled in the Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap published in January, Ireland has committed to introduce a range of reform measures to continue efforts to tackle Aggressive Tax Planning especially in relation to outbound payments. In addition, measures will also be delivered in respect of environmental taxation. </p>  <p>  In the draft recovery and resilience plan, from a tax perspective, commitments have been made to;</p>  <p>  - Apply enhanced Controlled Foreign Company rules to the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, effective 1 January 2021 (Finance Act 2020);</p>  <p>  - Publish external independent economic research on the impact of recent legislative changes, both domestically and internationally, on outbound payments from Ireland.  This was published on 14 June 2021;</p>  <p>  - Carry out a Public Consultation on the introduction of measures to ensure that Outbound Payments do not avail of double non-taxation. The public consultation and the responses received will be published on the Department of Finance website in due course;</p>  <p>  - Introduce legislation to safeguard against the possibility of double non-taxation of outbound payments in Finance Act 2023 at the latest;</p>  <p>  Finally, the Carbon Tax trajectory of increases provides for significant incremental tax increases that will raise significant extra revenue for the State and broaden the tax base. Within the context of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan the measure will be considered complete by 30 June 2025, however as part of Government commitments on climate action, the 2020 Finance Act legislated for incremental increases to 2030. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s draft National Recovery and Resilience Plan is currently being assessed by the European Commission which will, within two months, make a recommendation to the Council of the European Union, on the basis of which implementation of the Plan will commence and EU financial support will start to flow. </p>  <p>  A National Recovery and Resilience Plan Implementing Body will be established within the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to oversee its implementation. Reporting to the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, this Body will act as the lead authority for Ireland and as the single point of contact with the European Commission.</p></reply>

This arises from a 2014 European Central Bank Decision. The increase in negative interest charges since 2018 relates to the opening of the Surplus Public Expenditure Monies Account (SPEM) in September 2018. The SPEM was opened to hold surplus cash in the public expenditure system and replaced the Deposit Monies Investment Account (DMIA). Negative interest charges on the SPEM are a charge on the Finance Vote. Negative interest charges which accrued on the DMIA were paid by the NTMA. Therefore, the charges are not a new cost in General Government terms but a transfer from the NTMA to the Finance Vote.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.354.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600061#WRG02000"><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for workers (employees and self-employed) who are out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The taxation arrangements for the PUP, which were legislated for in Finance Act 2020, reflect the standard approach to taxing social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). The mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments such as Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue as follows:  </p>  <p>  The PUP was not taxed in the normal &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; manner in 2020, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was adopted to ensure payments reached recipients as quickly as possible given the suddenness of the pandemic and on the expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. Where tax liabilities still exist for 2020 after all additional tax credits such as health expenses have been applied, the balance can be collected interest free over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits. </p>  <p>  The continuation of the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, for most people receiving PUP payments in 2021, they will only pay tax when they return to work. When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the (PUP) claim with DSP. Once Revenue receives notification of the change from DSP, it adjusts the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly on a &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis and issues a revised payroll notification (RPN) to the employer. Revenue also issues a revised tax credit certificate to the employee.  </p>  <p>  Any delay in advising DSP of the return to work delays notification of the change to Revenue, which in turn delays employees receiving their full tax credit entitlements. For example, if there is a time delay between Revenue receiving the (PUP) claim closure notification from DSP and the employee&rsquo;s first payment from the employer, then s/he will not benefit from full tax credit and rate band entitlements for that pay period. It is also important to note that employees may receive additional PUP payments after returning to work as the scheme is paid in arrears, which can also impact on the initial tax adjustment. </p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the impact of PUP payments on taxation, it is worth noting that approximately 50% of recipients do not receive the highest rate of &euro;350 per week and a single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on the lower weekly payment rates of &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300. These recipients will in fact have built up credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 per week for the period out of work, which will be available for offset against any liabilities arising from the PUP once they return to work. For a single person in receipt of the &euro;350 PUP rate, their weekly tax credits will cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week.</p></reply>

There is no age criteria associated with these schemes.They are available provided that the business meets all other eligibility criteria as appropriate.

People aged 66 years and over are provided for through the State Pension (contributory) or the means-tested State Pension (non-contributory).</p><p>The Government have put in place a range of measures to support people and businesses most affected by the financial shock of the pandemic, including those mentioned above. The Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) and Tourism Business Continuity scheme have also been established in order to support those businesses most at risk. Other schemes which have been established include the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) and the Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS), both of which are targeted at supporting the commercial live performance sector. Details of the supports are available on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s website at the following link - <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/</i>.</p><p>Finally, I would note that the Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

This is because they were not serving in Revenue on 1 January 2003 (Integration Day), the designated date by reference to which eligibility for payment of the APTH was determined. </p>  <p>  The background is that following an extensive industrial relations negotiation process in 2002/2003, agreement was reached on the rationalisation and integration of General Service and Departmental Taxes grading structures in Revenue. Arising from the agreement, 1 January 2003 was designated as Integration Day and as of that date, Departmental Taxes grades were ceased, the individuals who were serving in those grades took on the duties and conditions of service of the equivalent General Service grades; and they were re-certified by the Civil Service Commission to General Service grades.</p>  <p>  As part of the Integration Agreement, a promotion/upgrading process was agreed and those individuals who were serving in Revenue on Integration Day and were not successful in the process, were instead awarded an Annual Personal to Holder Payment (APTH), an allowance paid on a personal-to-holder basis, in addition to the current salary point on an incremental scale, for as long as the person remains in that grade. Revenue staff who are still in receipt of an APTH are those who met the criteria above and who currently serve in the same grade in which they served on Integration Day, 1 January 2003. However, staff who were recruited or transferred into Revenue after Integration Day were not, and are not, eligible for the APTH payment.  </p></reply>

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  </p>  <p>  There is currently a 0% BIK rate for EVs, a measure that forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support their uptake including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. The BIK exemption was intended as a temporary measure and is set to end at year end 2022, coinciding with the onset of the new BIK regime on 1/1/2023. From this date EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with electric and hybrid vehicles.</p></reply>

However, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland have any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to any individual business or groups, as this is a commercial matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the <i>Solvency II</i>Directive). </p><p>Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups. In this regard, the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>sets out 66 actions across a number of policy areas, including the Department of Finance. Work is already underway to deliver these much-needed reforms. Recent achievements include the adoption of new Personal Injury Guidelines by the Judicial Council, and the creation of an <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>within the Department of Finance. </p><p>The new Personal Injury Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries.  It is my expectation that insurers will now commence reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments. Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectation in this regard. These engagements were positive, with providers indicating that they will begin lowering premiums in response to the Guidelines. </p><p>The Minister of State will meet with CEOs again later this year to review their ongoing response to this and other key reforms. My officials are also working closely with the IDA with a view to help bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market, including in areas of high footfall and in turn to help improve its overall competitiveness. </p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my expectation that the implementation of these key actions should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p><p>Finally, with respect to the correspondence highlighted in the question, it may interest the party involved to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. This can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. In addition, an individual has the right to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) in relation to any dealings with such providers where they feel they have been unfairly treated. The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider, and can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

The OPW has provided to the Deputy, a more general overview of occupancy of lodges in the Phoenix Park, so as to protect both the privacy of individual residents/employees and to avoid potential security issues arising from highlighting individual properties that may be vacant.</p>  <p>  Of the 41 lodges in the Phoenix Park, there are 9 currently vacant primarily due to their poor condition and/or location which makes them unsuitable for modern occupation.  These include 3 cottages, 2 Gate lodges, 2 keepers lodges and 2 flats.</p>  <p>  There is an ongoing programme to refurbish a number of lodges on a phased basis, subject to resources.  </p></reply>

While my Department had no involvement in the organisation of this project the organisers were provided with significant Government support as set out below.</p><p>In October 2017 the Minister of State for Diaspora Affairs Ciaran Cannon T.D. announced funding of $100,000 for this exhibition to be funded from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s diaspora affairs budget. </p><p>I am further advised that the Office of Public Works provided material support to the project by their hosting of the Exhibition in the Coach House in Dublin Castle at no charge to the organisers which, while not involving any loss of income to OPW, represented a significant saving for the organisers of the Exhibition. </p><p>In addition to the above my Department provided &euro;10,000 to support related activities including a series of lectures and family activities, and a panel presentation to explore aspects of the Great Hunger in Ireland and its diaspora.</p></reply>

The first allocations were announced in January 2020 and to date, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  </p>  <p>  Applications were invited under two streams. Stream 1 concerned assistance in the development of detailed plans for projects while Stream 2 provides assistance for the actual construction costs.</p>  <p>  One of the goals of the LSSIF is to maximise widespread community use of the projects being funded. It should be noted that the provision of license agreements was not mandatory for any application and the sharing of facilities was only one of the criteria used to assess applications. Of the 33 projects awarded provisional funding, 8 had a swimming pool element and one of these pools is located in Wicklow.  Full details of the scoring system is available on the Department's website. It was to be expected that license agreements were more likely for Stream 2 applications as they were at a more advanced stage of planning. It should be noted however, that the two streams were assessed independently with separate allocations made under each stream. This meant that Stream 1 applications were competing with other such applications when the overall funding was being allocated. </p>  <p>  While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is currently undertaking a Review of the LSSIF. This Review is considering progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded including to previously unsuccessful applications. The timing of any new call for proposals is also being considered along with any possible changes to the assessment methodology. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals, will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan. It is expected that my Department&rsquo;s Review of the LSSIF will be complete in the coming months. </p></reply>

In certain settings, such as live performances, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity or require them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.  Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.  Accordingly live music is not currently permitted.  As the Deputy is aware however, Government will be reviewing COVID restrictions before the 19th of July and I secured the agreement of Government last month to review the restrictions on performances at licensed venues, such as restaurants, pubs and hotels. </p>  <p>  In addition to reviewing the position in relation to live entertainment, on Friday May 28th the Government agreed pilot events will take place in June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the Arts Council and a number of stakeholder engagement structures in place to support the development and delivery of those pilot events. The following events have taken place to date:</p>  <p>  - Music concert in the Iveagh Gardens in collaboration with the National Concert Hall;</p>  <p>  - Chamber Orchestra at University Limerick;</p>  <p>  - Music Concert at the INEC in Killarney, and;</p>  <p>  - Music Festival at IMMA;</p>  <p>  Further events will take place across the course of the summer.  These events will assist in safely charting a path back to greater levels of activity in line with developments in public health guidance over the coming weeks and months.  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities and in order to evaluate and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors.  </p>  <p>  I remain firmly committed to the full return of all live entertainment at the earliest possible date, having regard to public health developments, and the pilot performances, together with a wide range of horizontal and direct supports for the sector, are all part of a suite of measures designed to sustain and support the sector in its recovery. </p></reply>

Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 makes provision for the disbursement of 7% of the net television licence fee receipts to the Broadcasting Fund operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which supports both the Sound and Vision (S&amp;V) and Archiving Schemes. The Broadcasting Fund is primarily allocated to Sound and Vision content creation spending, particularly in open funding rounds. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It should be noted that Sound and Vision rounds and Archiving projects can rollover across calendar years and under section 157 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009, the BAI may carry over funding into the following calendar year. </p>  <p>  In 2019 the BAI received an allocation of &euro;14.8m from TV Licence receipts for the Broadcasting Fund.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, the BAI was allocated &euro;14.9m from TV licence receipts for the Broadcasting Fund and I provided a further &euro;6.9m in Exchequer funding to the BAI in the course of the year, bringing the total to &euro;21.8m. This is the first time that exchequer funding was provided to supplement licence fee receipts for the Fund.  The additional &euro;6.9m comprised &euro;2m in the July Stimulus and an additional &euro;4.9m in December 2020 in recognition of ongoing COVID-19 impacts on the sector .  This increased the funding allocated by the BAI for Round 37 in December 2020 by &euro;3m, and the additional &euro;3.9m was carried over for disbursal in 2021. &euro;1.4m of this funding has now been allocated for the live music sector (as part of Round 38) and &euro;2.5m for the independent commercial radio sector (Round 39). </p></reply>

Securing and enhancing the accessibility of these new build dwellings to meet the identified needs of persons with disabilities forms the basis of a number of approaches by Government across housing types and tenures. </p><p>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of social housing in their areas, and, therefore, decide on the number and specific types of dwellings to provide in their developments, based on identified need.Social housing is built to the design standards set out in the guidelines 'Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities' available at www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C1979%2Cen.pdf.  </p><p>In preparing these Guidelines, particular account was taken of the objectives of government policy on sustainability, including access for people with disabilities and meeting the varied needs of occupants through their lifetime. The design approach to social housing seeks to eliminate barriers to accessibility for all users - particularly older people, and those with mobility impairment or other disability. Where units are being designed for those with disabilities, the Guidelines refer to the National Disability Authority publication 'Building for Everyone: Inclusion, Access and Use'. </p><p>More recently, the Housing Agency published a Roadmap titled 'Designing Housing to Meet the Needs of All' which has specific regard to the principles of universal design. www.housingagency.ie/sites/default/files/2019-07/Designing-Housing-to-meet-the-needs-of-all.pdf.</p><p>It also remains the case that all new buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2019.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. </p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>In addition, the joint policy statement <i>Housing Options for Our Ageing Population</i>, launched by my Department and the Department of Health in 2019 sets out an Action on universal design to &ldquo;In partnership with industry, introduce measures to ensure that over a five year period delivery is increased to ensure that 30% of all new dwellings are built to incorporate universal design principles to accommodate our ageing population.&rdquo;  The recent launch of the agefriendlyhomes.ie website means that an array of information to support the development of Age Friendly Housing, such as case studies, research, funding information and design templates are now available and further measures to deliver on this commitment are being advanced by my Department.</p><p>Finally, there is a review currently underway of the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability examining all of the areas of concern to people with disabilities, including the accessibility of social housing.  Issues arising for wheelchair users are being considered as part of the review, and the Irish Wheelchair Association are being consulted as important stakeholders. The second round of consultation for the review will be held in the Autumn and a new Strategy will take effect in January 2022.</p></reply>

The timing and scheduling of the Assembly will depend on the outcome of these discussions and on a number of external factors which need to be considered before the scope and terms of the Assembly are framed.</p>  <p>  In this regard, work is currently underway in my Department on putting a consultation in place to ensure the views of stakeholders, such as youths are included in the process. I consider it crucial that the views of our young people are properly and carefully considered in determining how we approach the biodiversity crisis in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN agreement that underpins global biodiversity policy, on developing and reaching agreement on a new Global Biodiversity Framework. This new Framework should be presented at the next Conference of the Parties to the CBD (COP15) in China later this year. It will set out the targets and actions agreed on among Parties, including Ireland, to respond to the biodiversity crisis over the next decade. </p>  <p>  Ireland's next National Biodiversity Action Plan is due to be published in 2022 and will be informed by the objectives of the new Framework. It would be useful if the Citizens Assembly was also scheduled so that its discussions can respond to the new global policy framework for biodiversity and help inform Ireland's role in it.  </p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations -&ndash; with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. </p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete. </p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. </p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC, and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. This process, which involves a public consultation on the proposals,  has commenced and is expected to take between four and five months to complete.</p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q4 2021. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed by Q4 2021. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits/   </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental. </p></reply>

Part of the impetus for this work arises from the review of fire safety in Ireland carried out in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy in the UK. It is also my intention that the Bill will place relevant elements of evolved emergency management practice at national and local level on a statutory footing and also revise the legislative approach to certain aspects of public safety in Ireland, with an initial focus on safety at funfairs.</p>  <p>  A General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation within my Department. The General Scheme has been informed by consultation with the relevant sectors likely to be impacted by its provisions. The shape of the Bill has been considered on a number of occasions by the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). The Board is comprised of Chief Executive Officers from local authorities, the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) as well as other Government Departments and supports the general approach being taken in the Bill.</p>  <p>  The intention of the Bill is to support and strengthen the role of local authorities.  The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of each individual fire authority.  The work of local authority fire services has, to a large degree, been underpinned by the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003 for nearly 40 years.  While this legislation has served the country well, and key indicators such as fatalities from fire per million of population have been reduced consistently to the point where they are at their lowest for forty years, it is appropriate now to ensure that the underpinning legislation fully reflects the changes is society and the expanded and more dynamic roles that our local authority fire services have taken on in recent years.  For that reason, the opinions of the local government sector have been sought as to the shape this legislation should take and preliminary opinion has also been received from the Local Government Management Association.</p>  <p>  Like all legislation, this is a complex piece of work, which necessitates consideration of multifaceted issues that impact on a number of sectors. The current Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 have stood the test of time for nearly 40 years. I want to ensure that its replacement also stands the test of time and when my Department is satisfied that the legislation being brought forward is appropriate, balanced, complete and robust. A Memorandum will be brought to Government on the issue in due course, followed by publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

Key to this was the publication of the <i>National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy</i>, published in 2018, contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports and guidance available to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p><b>-  The Repair and Leasing Scheme</b>which was to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country. The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. 247 properties have been brought back into use under the Repair and Lease scheme.</p><p><b>-  The Buy and Renew Scheme</b>particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community. It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners. 670 properties have been brought back into use under the scheme.</p><p><b>-  The Housing Acquisitions Fund</b>is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use.  The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. To date 844 properties have been brought back into use through the fund.</p><p>-  In December 2018 my Department published the <b>Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.</b>Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses.  The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download at:  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/home-ownership/vacant-homes/bringing-back-homes-manual-reuse-existing-buildings.</p><p>To support this work at local authority level, my Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority.</p><p>The Government set out its housing priorities in the Programme for Government across numerous areas, including homelessness, affordable home ownership, private and social housing delivery, rent reform and planning and my Department is focused on moving those priorities forward. </p><p>To deliver on these commitments, Minister O'Brien will publish a new housing policy and action plan 'Housing for All' this month which will provide a whole of Government approach to housing policy and is at an advanced stage of development at present. This plan will factor in existing demand, together with future projected demand, and put the steps in place needed to deliver just over 33,000 new homes per annum during the period 2020 to 2031.</p></reply>

In a democracy, any reform of the legislature must enjoy the confidence of the public as well as legislators.  In this regard The Programme for Government contains a broad range of electoral reforms including a commitment to establish an independent, statutory Electoral Commission. The Government is committed as a priority to the establishment of the Commission to enhance the governance of our democratic electoral processes.  </p>  <p>  While Seanad electoral reform is a matter for my Department, wider Seanad Reform is a matter for the Department of An Taoiseach. The all-party Seanad Reform Implementation Group published its report in December 2018, which contained many recommendations that related to electoral matters, and included proposals on implementation of the 2015 Manning Report.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations were not unanimously endorsed by the group&rsquo;s members. </p>  <p>  An Taoiseach has confirmed previously that while there was some brief consideration of that report by the Houses in late 2019, if further examination of its proposals by the current members of the Houses were to lead to a consensus around some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, such a consensus would provide a basis for their implementation.</p></reply>

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020. </p><p>My Department proactively engages with local authorities with a view to ensuring that the vacant site levy achieves its full potential in terms of bringing concerned sites into productive use. In this regard, my Department issued Circular Letter PL 03/2021 on 8 March 2021 requesting the submission of a progress report on the collection of the levy by each local authority. A response has now been received from each of the 31 local authorities. The progress reports noted the following: </p><p><b><i>2018</i></b></p><p>-  89 sites valued at &euro;132m were liable to the levy at the 3% rate in 2019 in respect of 2018;</p><p>-  86 letters issued in 2019/2020 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;4.1m in respect of 2018;</p><p>-  &euro;905k in levy payments were received in respect of 2018;</p><p>-  Levy payments of &euro;1.2m are outstanding in respect of 2018.*</p><p>(*It should be noted that some sites were cancelled following the issuing of a demand for payment due to appeal or commencement of development etc. As a result, the amount collected plus the amount outstanding does not equal the value of the demands issued.)</p><p><b><i>2019</i></b></p><p>-  181 sites valued at &euro;198m were liable to the levy at the 7% rate in 2020 in respect of 2019;</p><p>-  153 letters issued in 2020 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;13m in respect of 2019;</p><p>-  &euro;1.18m in levy payments were received in respect of 2019;  </p><p>-  Levy payments of &euro;11.5m are outstanding in respect of 2019.</p><p><b><i>2020</i></b></p><p>-  215 sites valued at &euro;268m were liable to the levy at the 7% rate in 2021 in respect of 2020;</p><p>-  79 letters issued in 2021 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;11.8m in respect of 2020;</p><p>-  &euro;21k in levy payments were received in respect of 2020;</p><p>-  Levy payments of &euro;14.3m are outstanding in respect of 2020.</p><p>It should be noted that the vacant site levy is collected in arrears. The levy due in respect of 2020 is collected in 2021. Local Authorities are still issuing demands in respect of 2020. A number of local authorities noted delays in issuing demands for payments in respect of 2020 due to COVID-19. Local Authorities will continue to issue demands for payment of the levy throughout 2021.</p><p>All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle and in respect of which levy liability is not paid. Local authorities are currently in the process of implementing debt recovery procedures to recoup arrears due.</p><p>The levy is not intended to be a revenue generating measure with the proceeds accruing to the relevant local authority rather than the Exchequer.  The levy proceeds generated are specifically intended to be used by local authorities for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their administration costs in collecting the levy.  </p><p>The progress reports received from planning authorities in response to Circular PL 03/2021 are currently being examined in greater detail by my Department to consider, amongst other things, what further implementation supports may be required. My Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure that all vacant site levies due are paid and that the measure can achieve its full potential.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.569.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600064#WRK00700"><p>The report referred to by the Deputy was received by my Department on 9 June and is under consideration by my officials.  It is a wide ranging report, which covers funding from a variety of different Government Departments for a range of issues and schemes. Many of the funding lines are outside of the remit of my Department.  The report has also been sent for consideration to other relevant Government Departments. The funding system for local authorities is complex, with authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources including local sources such as commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding from Central Government, these can generally be grouped into five broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport.  In relation to funding streams specifically from my Department, &euro;135.3m and &euro;167.5m was provided to Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the COVID commercial rates and other COVID related expenses that occurred in 2020.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of that process, to vary the ARV and LPT in order to increase the revenue available to them.  I note that for 2020 and 2021 Cork County Council raised their LPT rate by +5% and +7.5% respectively, foregoing the maximum 15% raise or just over &euro;3m in 2020 and &euro;2.4m in 2021.</p>  <p>  In relation to the plans recently announced by the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D to reform LPT, these reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case.</p>  <p>  I refer, also, to the unprecedented support for local authorities during the COVID pandemic. In 2020, Cork County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 9,000 businesses and recouped &euro;34.7 m in that regard from my Department.  In addition, in recognition of COVID related income losses, and additional COVID related expenditure incurred in 2020, my Department provided funding of &euro;6.7 m to Cork County Council.  The Government has introduced a commercial rates waiver for 2021, which has been extended to end of September, at an estimated cost &euro;480 m. As has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and provide them with the necessary financial supports.</p></reply>

Following further discussions between my Department and Clare County Council it was agreed that the local authority would take a lead role in determining, in accordance with the IS: 465 protocol, that issues arising in homes in County Clare are in fact due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks and secondly quantify the likely extent of the problem in the county. </p>  <p>  Such analysis will provide the evidential basis necessary for the consideration of any extension of the scheme. Pending the receipt of and consideration of such analysis it would be premature to consider an extension of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Separately, I have established a time-bound working group, with representatives from my Department, the local authorities and homeowner representative groups in Donegal and Mayo, to quickly review and report on any outstanding issues in relation to the operation of the existing Defective Concrete Block Grant scheme. The membership of the working group has already been agreed and will remain unchanged.</p>  <p>  The Group will examine issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering and allowable costs etc.  I expect that the review, to be undertaken by the working group will be completed by 31 July, and will inform any changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required. Following receipt of a report of the working group I will, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, bring proposals in this regard to Government.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes a commitment to deliver 50,000 new social homes with a focus on new build homes. This commitment was underpinned by investment of &euro;3.3bn towards housing programmes in Budget 2021. Subject to the impact of COVID-19, this investment will fund the delivery of 12,750 new social homes in 2021, including 9,500 new build homes.  </p>  <p>  In progressing this major construction programme it is important to pursue timely delivery while also ensuring value for money in terms of Exchequer funding. In this regard, social housing projects, like all publicly-funded construction projects, must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Public Spending Code and Capital Works Management Framework, the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability.   </p>  <p>  My Department, working with local authorities has sought to streamline the four-stage pre-construction process for social housing and to introduce other measures to increase the pace of delivery.  Local authorities have also been able to reduce the pre-construction timeline further using design and build frameworks. Off-site construction has also been used to reduce local authority construction timelines.  </p>  <p>  The social housing project at Nangor Road, which is being progressed by South Dublin County Council and will deliver 93 social homes, is advancing through the 4 stage process utilised for publicly funded capital projects and was granted Stage 3 approval (pre-tender approval) in December 2020. The Council is currently preparing a Stage 4 application (tender) for submission to my Department.  Given the scale of this project along with the requirements of the Public Spending Code at the time of the original submission in 2019, the Council submitted a Cost Effectiveness Analysis. This was assessed and approved by my Department and meets all the requirements of the relevant Public Spending Code from 2013. </p>  <p>  The Clonburris Strategic Development Zone project will include the delivery of some 2,500 social and affordable homes by South Dublin County Council. My Department is actively engaged with the Council and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to bring this project forward and ensure that the first step of the 2019 Public Spending Code Project Lifecycle, the Strategic Assessment Review, is completed accordingly. The project will continue through the various steps of the Project Lifecycle of the Public Spending Code in parallel with the Stage applications for funding to my Department as the individual phases develop. There are two phases currently being progressed; Phase 1, Kishogue South West,  Clonburris will deliver 274 new social and affordable homes while Phase 2, The Canal Extension, Clonburris will deliver 113 social and affordable homes.  </p>  <p>  South Dublin County Council also applied for and received approval in principle for Service Site Funding for Clonburris to assist in the delivery of affordable and cost rental homes. </p>  <p>  There are currently two housing projects being progressed at St Michael&rsquo;s Estate. The first, the Lands at Emmet Road, is a mixed tenure development consisting of 30% social and 70% cost rental units. My Department has been engaging with Dublin City Council  to progress this important development which is currently Stage 1 approved for the social housing element.  Dublin City Council has submitted a Strategic Assessment Report and is currently preparing a Preliminary Business Case in line with Public Spending Code requirements. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council also applied for and received approval in principle for Service Site Funding for the Lands at Emmet Road to assist in the delivery of affordable and cost rental homes.  </p>  <p>  The second housing project is St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate Housing with Supports Pilot Project.  This consists of 52 homes for senior citizens and is being developed by the Circle Voluntary Housing Association Ltd.

Most of the funding from Central Government to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: housing, transport, recreational, education and environment. </p>  <p>  My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, covering a broad range of functions, including local authority housing, voluntary housing, homeless services, estate regeneration, energy efficiency retrofitting, housing grants, rural water schemes, urban renewal/regeneration, and fire services.  In order to achieve its business objectives, my Department allocates significant resources to an extensive range of organisations, including local authorities, dedicated agencies, and other bodies; some allocations, depending on the programmes concerned, are made on a national or other non-county basis in the form of grant funding.  </p>  <p>  Grant funding is provided primarily on the basis of vouched expenditure, as opposed to specific up front annual allocations, once all necessary requirements as detailed in grant assistance schemes are met by the bodies/organisations concerned and that appropriate systems and procedures are in place to ensure the exercise of proper financial controls.  Accordingly, the circumstances of funding being returned to the Exchequer do not arise. </p></reply>

Across Syria, 13.4 million people need humanitarian assistance including more than 3 million people in the North West of the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN, led by Special Envoy Pedersen, to bring the conflict in Syria to a sustainable conclusion. We have consistently called for the full implementation of a nationwide ceasefire, and are extremely concerned by the recent escalation of violence in Southern Idlib. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently deplored attacks on civilians in Syria, including in our statements on the Security Council. Addressing the Security Council on June 25, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador strongly condemned the recent attack on Al-Shifaa hospital in Afrin, which resulted in the killing and injury of civilians, including medical personnel and children, and the destruction of parts of the hospital. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also co-sponsored multiple Resolutions at the United Nations Human Rights Council, most recently in March, condemning attacks on humanitarian workers and demanding that all parties to the conflict comply fully with their obligations under international law. Ireland and the EU have repeatedly condemned violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law perpetrated by the Syrian regime and others, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, established to gather evidence of such crimes and recognises the vital work undertaken by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria.</p>  <p>  On the Security Council, Ireland acts with Norway as &lsquo;co-penholder&rsquo; on the Syria Humanitarian file. In this role, we have strongly advocated for humanitarian aid to be able to reach all people in need. Ahead of the expiry of the mandate of the UN operation at Bab al-Hawa on 10 July, we are undertaking extensive engagement with all relevant parties, including Council Members, countries in the region, the UN system and civil society. As Ireland has made clear on the Security Council, the cross border operation remains a vital lifeline for millions of people in North West Syria, and we believe that it must be extended for as long as is necessary.  </p></reply>

Ireland strongly condemned this act, as did D&aacute;il Eireann on 1 June when it unanimously passed the Government's motion on the situation in Belarus. </p>  <p>  We are deeply concerned for the welfare of Mr. Protasevich and Ms. Sapega. Videos of Mr. Protasevich &ldquo;confessing&rdquo; to crimes show signs of a forced declaration. There have been thousands of reports of human rights violations in Belarus, including torture. We note that they have been reportedly moved to house arrest. The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor the situation closely and Ireland will continue to call for their immediate, full and unconditional release. </p>  <p>  The EU and like-minded international partners have been working to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are brought to account. An EU-led resolution at the Human Rights Council has given the UN High Commission for Human Rights a mandate to investigate human rights violations and her team is initiating their work. Ireland is one of dozens of members of the international community who have issued a joint statement at the 47th session of the UN Human Rights Council calling for the release of Mr. Protasevich. Along with our EU partners, we will also seek a mandate renewal for the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus and we will maintain our call for the Belarusian authorities to grant her access to the country in her official capacity. </p>  <p>  Sanctions also play a role in ensuring accountability. The EU recently imposed further targeted sanctions against those responsible for the ongoing repression and the incident which led to Mr. Protasevich's detention, bringing the total to 166 individuals and 15 business entities. Sectoral economic sanctions have also been imposed and Ireland is open to going further should the situation not improve.</p></reply>

Ireland is engaging with all relevant parties, including Security Council members, countries in the region, the UN system and civil society.  Guiding our engagements is the principle, which Ireland has repeatedly stated at the Security Council, that the cross border operation remains vital to ensuring that aid reaches millions of people in North West Syria.  It is my belief that the mandate must be extended for as long as is necessary. </p>  <p>  In parallel, we continue to work closely with our humanitarian partners to ensure that Ireland's national response to the Syria crisis addresses the enormous needs in Syria and the region., including and especially those outlined in this question.  There are 13.4 million Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than three million people in the north-west. </p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;190 million in humanitarian assistance to the Syria crisis to date, our largest response ever to a single crisis. This includes &euro;23 million for 2021, distributed through the UN, Irish NGOs and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Ireland also contributes core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Syria, including WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).</p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland responds to needs in Syria through the EU.  So far this year the EU has mobilised &euro;130 million in humanitarian aid to provide vital assistance to millions of Syrians in need inside the country and a further &euro;65 million to support Syrians who are displaced across the region.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-  Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>-  No school  will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>-  SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>-  Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.  Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>-  As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.  Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie.</p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>As children who have additional learning needs, or special educational needs, can now be supported in school regardless of whether they have a diagnosis of a particular special educational need, or not, it is not possible to definitively state how many pupil have a disability, or some form of special educational needs, and attend second-level schools in each given year. </p><p>My Department continues to prioritise investment in special education, with over &euro;2 Billion due to be spent on special education this year.</p><p>For the coming school year there will be over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream schools, who will support class teachers to address the special educational needs and learning needs of pupils who attend mainstream schools.</p><p>This year we are also providing for two new special schools and 269 new special classes.</p><p>For the 2021/22 school year, we will have a total of 2118 special classes, which is the largest number of special classes that we have ever had, and compares to 548 classes available in 2011.</p><p>18,000 Special Needs Assistants will also be available to support the care needs of pupils with special educational needs in our schools.</p><p>The additional supports which are being provided will ensure that all children can be provided with education, regardless of the additional needs that they may have. </p></reply>

For example, it is important to have a complete awareness of the number of people who could potentially be involved, the legal implications of any course of action and an accurate estimate of likely costs before introducing any modifications to the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with officials from the Office of the Attorney General in order to progress these complex matters.  This work has now been significantly advanced, following some unavoidable delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate students were given the option of receiving Calculated Grades for the subjects they were studying. </p>  <p>  Students were also able to sit the 2020 Leaving Certificate examinations last November and December when it was safe for these examinations to proceed. </p>  <p>  The results of the Calculated Grades process issued on 7 September 2020.

Arrangements are being made for the 2020 Leaving Certificate to be issued in the first term of the new school year.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the SEC can, under the powers recently assigned to it, provide certified statements of Leaving Certificate results combining the results of both processes, showing the candidate&rsquo;s final results, including, as appropriate, results which are the better of examinations and calculated grades, to candidates on request.</p></reply>

Following the application of this model in 2017, a further 79 schools were included in the DEIS programme and 30 schools were upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status. </p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan acknowledged that further work was required to refine the model and therefore, in terms of the further extension of the DEIS Programme to more schools, an extensive body of work has been undertaken in terms of the refinement of this model. This is based on the latest school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index.  A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. My Department has commenced a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the refinement of the model, and work is now ongoing on final elements of the model.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that this will provide the basis for the development and application of a refined DEIS resource allocation model to ultimately match resources to identified need.  Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools. </p></reply>

Also in attendance were officials from the NCCA, the Department of Education, The Professional Development Service for Teachers, the Teachers Union of Ireland, the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland and co-opted teachers . The purpose of the 'Agricultural Science in Practice Group' is to be a forum that can be used to generate and collate early insights and authentic examples from practice of Agricultural Science as it is enacted in classrooms, and to publish these in an NCCA document.</p>  <p>  I understand that the IASTA raised concerns regarding the Individual Investigative Study section of the Leaving Certificate at the above mentioned meetings and with the State Examinations Commission. I also understand that the IASTA wished to have the coursework element of the assessment process cancelled or made optional. If this request had been acceded to, it would have raised very significant issues of  equity and fairness, not only in this subject but in other subjects where there was a coursework requirement in the final assessment.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-  Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically roll over into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>-  No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>-  SNAs currently in mainstream settingscan continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>-  Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>-  As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

This decision was taken by government to ensure for every candidate in 2021, a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education, and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.</p>  <p>  The written examinations began on 9 June and ran until 17 June in the case of Leaving Certificate Applied and 29 June in the case of Leaving Certificate (established).</p>  <p>  Candidates were provided with the choice of sitting the examinations, opting to receive Accredited Grades or both on a subject by subject basis. This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.</p>  <p>  The results this year are expected to issue by the SEC on Friday 3 September through the Candidate Self Service Portal. The results issue date this year must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates.  To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two.</p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information.  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.  The CAO have announced that Round 1 offers will be made on 7 September. </p>  <p>  For those Leaving Certificate candidates who have applied to pursue their higher education in UK universities, the UCAS general deadline for acceptance of conditional offers is 8 September 2021. It is understood that a small number of UK higher education institutions (HEIs) are operating an earlier date than 8 September for the acceptance of offers. As was the case in 2020 the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are again this year engaging with such HEIs in the UK to clarify the position regarding Leaving Certificate students and to seek that flexibility will be exercised with regard to the registration of these students. I have also written to my ministerial colleagues in other jurisdictions seeking their support in this matter.</p>  <p>  It is, however, important that candidates who have applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland should engage with the institutions to which they have applied as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position.</p></reply>

Accordingly your question has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited. The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided.</p>  <p>  In processing applications for an exceptional review of SNA support, the NCSE considers each application on the basis of the information provided by the school. Schools are required to use their existing allocation and deploy SNAs in support of the care needs as they are currently presenting in the school. The NCSE examines the application to identify whether there has been a significant change in the profile of care needs in the school. In some cases an additional allocation is required and is subsequently made available to the school. As advised in the Guidelines on the SNA Exceptional Review process published on the NCSE website, priority is given to schools with no or limited SNA resources and to rapidly developing schools.</p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 Exceptional Review process, given the particular public health requirements and the fact that school buildings were closed for some of the year, wherever possible the opportunity was taken to conclude a review as an office based exercise. In most cases this resulted with the review being brought to a conclusion without a school visit. However, in some cases it was also necessary to visit the school in order to complete the process and 320 such school visits took place.  The school visit provides an opportunity to engage with teachers, SNAs and school management on the effective deployment of SNAs in the school and the NCSE is thankful to schools for facilitating their taking place. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have confirmed that 1,488 SNA Exceptional Review applications were received, and outcomes notified to schools. Of these, 772 schools received an increase amounting to 539.39 additional posts allocated. The number of appeals received was 137.</p></reply>

This included measures to support the provision of teaching support during the school closure period and a supplementary education scheme.</p><p>All schools reopened on 12 April.  Priority was then given to planning for an expanded summer programme.  There was extensive consultation with stakeholders with a particular focus on the barriers to school participation.  Steps were taken to address issues identified including the provision of paid planning and preparation time, flexibility on the timing, reduced administrative burden, increased guidance and support and arrangements to pay teachers and SNAs earlier.  </p><p>The arrangements for an expanded summer programme for 2021 were announced in May some weeks ahead of last year, with a budget of &euro;40m. Under the 2021 programme, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage will have access to an enhanced summer programme of education. </p><p>Participation by schools, teachers and SNAs is voluntary. </p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management of the school having regard to the resources available whether or not it will participate in the programme</p><p>A home based strand is available for children with complex needs as in previous years.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is: &ldquo;Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.&rdquo;</p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool and any updates to this material will be published there.</p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074/2020, &lsquo;Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.</p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education</i><i>and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers</i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning. A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who were due to take these examinations.</p><p>I am anxious conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.</p><p>On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. Following this meeting, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the <i>Assessment Arrangements for Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, </i>as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Minor changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific to the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month.</p><p>On the same date I also announced that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.  The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p></reply>

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:</p>  <p>  - build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p>  <p>  experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p>  <p>  - be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, where their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  </p>  <p>  This approach to supporting wellbeing has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements in mental health.  </p>  <p>  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:</p>  <p>  - The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)  </p>  <p>  - Guidance Counselling service/provision  </p>  <p>  - National Council for Special Education (NCSE)   </p>  <p>  - Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team </p>  <p>  - Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service</p>  <p>  - Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI)  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a school-based, consultative, psychological service in two ways &ndash; through the provision of an individual casework service for students and a support and development service for school staff. </p>  <p>  The NEPS casework service involves the provision of a psychological service for a student, with the psychologist working with the student, teachers and parents, and other professionals if appropriate, to identify need and plan for intervention and review to support the student in school.  This service can take place over an extended period of time with NEPS psychologists.  This model does not operate on a waiting list basis, and extends to approximately 8000 students per annum. </p>  <p>  The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. </p>  <p>  This model of service allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  The capacity of NEPS has increased significantly from its 2016 allocation of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologists.  The capacity of NEPS was increased recently as part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools when the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole-time equivalent psychologist posts.  This represents by far the highest number of psychologists sanctioned for NEPS since its inception in 2000.  The capacity of NEPS will be kept under review and I hope to be in a position to increase this capacity in future years.  </p>  <p>  At post primary level, a Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. </p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020/21 is 852. </p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs. In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  These include services provided by the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, spunout, Bodywhys and Childline.  </p>  <p>  My Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. </p>  <p>  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. </p></reply>

Public health remain of the view that schools are low risk environments and that the infection prevention and control measures in place in school are effective.  </p>  <p>  The CMO has also made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are low risk environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. </p>  <p>  Public Health have stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. Schools have been supported by a funding package of almost &euro;650m to put in place and maintain these key infection control measures. Public Health advice is that compliance with these measures ensure that schools remain safe places for children and staff. </p>  <p>  Schools have been advised that it is expected that they will continue to operate with the current infection prevention and control measures in place to support their safe operation during Covid-19 when they reopen in for the 2021/2022 school year. Schools will continue to be supported in terms of the additional resources necessary to provide for these measures.</p>  <p>  Schools Covid-19 response plans are based on the Government&rsquo;s Work Safely Protocol which reflects the most up to date public health advice for the workplace. It sets out the range of measures required to prevent the spread of Covid-19. These plans will be updated by the Department during the summer and will be available for schools in advance of reopening. It is not envisaged that there will be any updates that require schools to take action in advance of normal reopening.</p>  <p>  The Department will undertake a communications campaign with parents and students/pupils in advance of school reopening to inform and remind them of the arrangements in place in schools operating during Covid-19.  This will include specifically targeted information at new pupils entering primary and post-primary schools to ensure they are familiar with the new arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work closely with all of the education partners and public health specialists so that schools will continue to be supported when they reopen for the 2021/2022 school year. </p></reply>

However, this estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 44.2 percent for young people at the end of June.  In Wexford alone as of July 6th, there are over 1,200 people under the age of 25 in receipt of the PUP, accounting for approximately 22 percent of all recipients in the county.</p>  <p>  While the employment of young people across the country has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that they are also the most resilient, with youth unemployment levels typically falling quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  Many have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease.  This is reflected in the significant decline in the number of people in receipt of the PUP, including among young persons.</p>  <p>  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, re-skill and to find new jobs.  Therefore, Government is supporting a range of initiatives to assist people back to work; as outlined under the Economic Recovery Plan launched on June 1st.  The key delivery mechanism to the Plan&rsquo;s second pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo; will be my Department&rsquo;s forthcoming national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  This strategy, which will be launched later this month, will seek to support people back into employment and will include a range of measures targeted at young persons; including an expanded JobsPlus recruitment subsidy scheme, an additional 50,000 education and training places, a new Government Youth Employment Charter and a new work placement scheme open to all regardless of age.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware however, of the differing regional impacts of the pandemic and the need for targeted, localised employment supports.  My Department operates a team of Intreo Case Officers and Job Coaches in Co. Wexford (Wexford town, Enniscorthy and New Ross), who provide a one-to-one career advice service and tailored employment supports to young jobseekers.  These Officers engage with agencies such as the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB) to support customers, many of whom are young people, to avail of training and education opportunities.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the implementation of the national and local policy measures and responses outlined above will assist young people who are seeking jobs to find a pathway back to employment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  While I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland, extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

The category of insurability includes cases where Scope Section has made decisions on the appropriate class of PRSI, as well as other matters determined by Deciding Officers, including voluntary contributions and the correct contribution records of individuals.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's reference to appeals being heard &quot;with a number of cases attached to each one&quot; the Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the discussion in relation to the use of &lsquo;test cases&rsquo; before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 5th December 2019 specifically related to a number of cases considered in the 1990s.  These cases, involving workers in a particular sector, were selected as so called 'test cases' not to determine the employment status of all workers in that sector but rather to identify criteria that could be used by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers for the purpose of assessing each case on an individual basis and to improve the quality and consistency of decision making in relation to the determination of whether an individual was employed or self-employed.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the test cases were not used to determine a particular outcome on a 'group basis' that would be applied to all cases from that employment sector, as seems to have been inferred by some observers, but instead that the cases informed the identification of criteria  that could be applied to each individual case in that sector. Decision makers (both Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers) would then apply these criteria to all cases that came before them and depending on the circumstances of each case, as assessed by reference to these criteria, an individual decision would be made in each case.  This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a code which was subsequently updated in 2007 under the Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement. </p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has also advised me that every individual making an appeal to her office always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer.  On rare occasions, usually where a number of workers engaged by the same employer are concerned, she may be asked either by the workers or the employer to make decisions on a &lsquo;sample&rsquo; number of cases.  The Chief Appeals Officer has agreed to this approach in very limited circumstances and only with the agreement of both the employer and the workers concerned.  This approach has not been adopted during the period of her tenure in any case of an appeal where the classification of a worker as an employee or self-employed is the issue under appeal.  </p><p>This approach can be an efficient way of dealing with issues that are common in appeal cases and where there are a number of workers attached to an appeal.  However, the approach cannot compromise the integrity of the appeal process or deny any individual interested party due process.  Each individual always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer.  Importantly, an individual decision issues in each case, and can be individually submitted for review to the Chief Appeals Officer or indeed, appealed to the Courts.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Insurability appeals decided by Appeals Officers 2011 to 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th></th>       <th>Decided</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td></td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td></td>       <td>96</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td></td>       <td>57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td></td>       <td>79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td></td>       <td>91</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td></td>       <td>106</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td></td>       <td>75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td></td>       <td>79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td></td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td></td>       <td>75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to end of June)</td>       <td></td>       <td>31</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Both of these schemes allow individuals to work up to 3 days a week and retain access to a reduced jobseekers payment. </p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit is paid for up to 9 months (or 234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid.  It is paid for up to 6 months (or 156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid. </p>  <p>  It is a fundamental feature of a range of the Department's benefit payments, including Jobseeker's Benefit, that the payment is time-limited.  Time limits apply across a range of PRSI related schemes, such as maternity benefit and illness benefit. </p>  <p>  Where a person exhausts their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit, they may be eligible for support under the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance scheme.  The Department contacts the Jobseeker's Benefit recipient in advance of the expiry date of their claim to advise them that their entitlement is due to expire and that they can make an application for Jobseeker's Allowance, which is also included in the correspondence.  </p>  <p>  Entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance ensures that those most financially disadvantaged will continue to receive income support.  The maximum weekly personal rate of Jobseeker's Allowance and Benefit schemes are aligned at &euro;203.  Jobseeker's Allowance has no duration limit as long as a person meets the qualifying scheme conditions including the means test.   </p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme provided by the Community Welfare Service is also available to any person who is in need of financial assistance.  There are several payments within the scheme, including basic weekly Supplementary Welfare Allowance, supplements, Exceptional Needs Payments and Urgent Needs Payments.</p>  <p>  The wide ranging nature of the assistance available to those impacted by Covid-19, including the Employment Wage Subsidy scheme for employers, constitutes a comprehensive suite of supports and there are no plans to extend the duration of Jobseeker's Benefit at this time.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

Income tax and social insurance payable by a self-employed contributor are treated as one aggregate sum.  For this reason, it is not possible to separate a person&rsquo;s payments to Revenue between their tax and social insurance liabilities, or to front-load the discharge of the self-employment contributions element of their overall tax liability. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions including commencing insurable employment before the age of 56 years and having a minimum of 520 qualifying PRSI contributions.  A person approaching their 66th birthday may submit an application for State Pension (Contributory) but will not qualify for a pension unless and until he or she fully satisfies all of the eligibility conditions.  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, State Pension (Contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged. </p>  <p>  A person approaching his/her 66th birthday may submit an application for State Pension (Contributory), but it is not possible to award the pension until such time as the eligibility conditions have been fully satisfied by the claimant. </p>  <p>  With respect to self-employed people, social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced on 6th April 1988.  Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year are liable to pay social insurance contributions at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  Such contributors are currently covered for a wide range of social insurance benefits including State Pension (Contributory).</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, stipulates that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory), unless the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one year prior to reaching age 66 and all outstanding self-employment contributions have been paid by him/her in full.  </p>  <p>  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, State Pension (Contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-06a.920.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070600068#WRO06400"><p>The experience of past recessions indicates that youth employment tends to be significantly impacted by any labour market shock.  This is because many employers operate a "last in-first out" approach when reducing their labour force.  Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic: namely, the hospitality (accommodation &amp;amp; food) and retail sectors.</p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12% in December 2019.  Latest estimates from the CSO, however, indicate that the traditional unemployment rate for young persons stood at 19.9 percent for young people in June.  This estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 44.2 percent for young people at the end of June.</p>  <p>  A significant number of PUP recipients are students.  As of this week (July 6th 2021), it is estimated that approximately 22,000 PUP recipients are students, with the vast majority under the age of 25.  Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force.  Therefore, the inclusion of PUP recipients, including students, in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment serves to inflate this measure.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, it is at present not possible to say what the precise level of youth unemployment is.</p>  <p>  While the employment of young people has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that they are also the most resilient, with youth unemployment levels typically falling quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  Many have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease.  This is reflected in the significant decline in the number of people in receipt of the PUP, including among young persons.</p>  <p>  I expect to see continued returns to work, including among young persons, as our economy and society continues to reopen.  However, we must also be aware that some jobs will be permanently lost as a result of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Therefore, Government is supporting a range of initiatives to assist people back to work; as outlined under the Economic Recovery Plan launched on June 1st.  The key delivery mechanism to the Plan&rsquo;s second pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo; will be my Department&rsquo;s forthcoming national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  This strategy, which will be launched later this month, will seek to support people back into employment and will include a range of measures targeted at young persons; including an expanded JobsPlus recruitment subsidy scheme, an additional 50,000 education and training places, a new Government Youth Employment Charter and a new work placement scheme open to all regardless of age.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The quickest and easiest way to apply for the payment is online at www.MyWelfare.ie. The prescribed time for making a claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is in line with the provisions applying to Jobseeker's Benefit and Allowance, and claims should be made on the first day that a person is unemployed. If a person makes a late application they may lose out on payment. Social welfare legislation also provides that where a claimant proves to the satisfaction of a deciding officer or an appeals officer that there was good cause for the delay in making a claim, then the claim may be backdated. However, payment cannot be made for any period exceeding 6 months before the date on which the claim was made. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment will close to new applications from 8 July 2021.  A person who wishes to make a retrospective application for periods prior to that date should do so in writing by contacting my Department. As part of that process, the individual will need to outline the reasons for the delay in their application. Their application will then be considered by a deciding officer.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This week there are 221,000 in receipt of the PUP, representing a reduction of approximately 55% from the most recent peak seen in February, when public health restrictions were at their highest level this year.  However, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs and in transitioning back to work.</p>  <p>  A central focus of Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, which was launched on June 1st 2021, is on helping people get back to work, through the provision of employment supports, additional training, reskilling and work placement opportunities. </p>  <p>  Central to achieving this objective will be the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;, which will be launched later this month.  By increasing labour market supports, and through the provision of employment supports, activation and skills opportunities, the Pathways to Work strategy will act as a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second pillar &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work, and the response across the Public Employment Service and Further Education and Training Sector, will focus on supporting people to prepare for and gain employment, including in providing upskilling and reskilling opportunities to facilitate people to transition into quality sustainable jobs in high-performing growth sectors (including sectors such as biopharma, MedTech, information and communications technology and FoodTech). </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those made unemployed, many of which are linked to growth sectors.  Among these opportunities are those offered by Skillnet Ireland as well as the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme (AIS) which my colleague, Minister Harris, announced last week would be extended until the end of December 2021.  The AIS scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship.  In addition, the new Action Plan for Apprenticeship will continue the progress of developing and promoting apprenticeship provision, including in new and emerging sectors, over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting the ongoing work and engagement between my Department and the agencies of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Local Enterprise Offices at a regional level.  In particular, this is done through the nine Regional Skills Fora, each of which has its own sectoral composition and specific skill requirements.  This engagement allows both my Department, and the Further and Higher Education sector, to tailor its response to meet the needs of regional enterprises, many of which are in the specialised high-performing sectors referenced by the Deputy.  In this way, my Department supports transitions into sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include: </p><p><b>A)  The Disability Awareness Support Scheme (DASS Grant)</b></p><p>DASS provides a contribution towards the cost of disability awareness training for private sector employers.  The training to be delivered must, for example, provide clear and accurate information about disability, address questions that employers/employees may have, and cover anti-discrimination / equal opportunities legislation.  The value of the grants available is as set out below:   <table>    <tr>       <th>First year a company applies  </th>       <th>90% of eligible training costs up to a maximum of &euro;20,000 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Second and subsequent years a company applies </td>       <td>80% of eligible training costs up to a maximum of &euro;20,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>B)  The Reasonable Accommodation  Fund Grants (RAFG)</b></p><p>The four grants available under this fund are: </p><p>1. Employee Retention Grant (ERG) </p><p>2. Job Interview Interpreter Grant (JIIG) </p><p>3. Personal Reader Grant (PRG) </p><p>4. Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant WEAG)  </p><p><i>The Workplace Equipment / Adaptation Grant:</i></p><p>With regards to assistive technology, where a person with a disability has been offered employment, is in employment or is self-employed and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s/he or the employer can apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment.  A maximum grant of &euro;6,350 is available towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment.  Applications in excess of this sum are also considered, on an individual basis, up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for assistive technology is required. </p><p>It is important to note that the DASS and WEAG grants differ from the income supports (such as Disability Allowance or the Blind Pension) provided by the Department, in that they are demand led.  The overall value of the grants provided each year rises or falls in response to the number of applications received.  It is therefore not possible to predict in advance the impact of percentage increases with any degree of certainty.  However, details of the value and number of grants provided, by grant type, in 2019, 2020 and 2021 are set out in the tables below for information. </p><p>I would also add that the funding the Department makes available through the grants it administers, does not impact or lessen the obligation on employers to provide reasonable accommodations.  The provision of reasonable accommodations by all employers is a legally enforceable right for both jobseekers and employees.  The Employment Equality Acts oblige employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of both employees and job applicants with disabilities, except where to do so would impose a disproportionate burden on them. </p><p><b>Table 1: WEAG </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of grants provided </th>       <th>Value of the grants provided </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019  </td>       <td>37 </td>       <td>&euro;81,968 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020  </td>       <td>42 </td>       <td>&euro;84,150 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021*</td>       <td><br /><br /></td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Up to May 2021 </p><p><b>Table 2: DASS </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of Companies </th>       <th>Value of the grants provided </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019  </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>&euro;52,959 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020  </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>&euro;5,598 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 * </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>&euro;6,650 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Up to May 2021 </p><p>By way of additional information, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (for people with disabilities) 2015 &ndash; 2024, contains the following action (action 3.7).  &lsquo;Support relevant departments in the implementation of the Make Work Pay Recommendation No. 3.

The introduction of a TCA approach is a key feature of the Government's 'Roadmap for Pensions Reform'. </p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government introduced an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which includes up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring periods.  The provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994.  Accordingly, those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits/homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, as part of the Programme for Government, a Commission on Pensions was set up to look at sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission will outline options for the Government to address issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, pensions calculation methods and eligibility requirements.  The Commission is due to report on its findings in the near future and the Government has committed to consider these findings within six months of their receipt. </p>  <p>  Therefore, as a final design for TCA has not yet been decided upon by Government, it is not possible at this juncture to provide the requested costs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p><p>DA is structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or in insurable employment.  When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied (disregarded), for the purpose of the means test. </p><p>The ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model has been used for the purposes of the estimate requested.The additional cost of increasing the upper limit of the earnings disregard for the disability allowance from &euro;350 in increments of &euro;10, &euro;50 and &euro;100 respectively are set out in tabular form below.</p><p>It is important to note that SWITCH is a tax-benefit microsimulation developed by the ESRI.  It provides <b>estimates</b>of full-year policy changes, using data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  These estimates are based on current Disability Allowance recipients.  As Disability Allowance is a comparatively small scheme in terms of recipients, there may be issues around sample size when running costings.  SWITCH cannot predict changes in behaviour (including increased take-up of employment).  It should be noted that increased disregards may in fact increase the number of eligible recipients, and therefore, increase the overall Disability Allowance expenditure.</p><p><b>Table: Disability Allowance Disregard Upper Limit Increase from &euro;350.00 in increments of &euro;10.00, &euro;50.00 and &euro;100.00.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Base value</th>       <th>New value</th>       <th>Increase</th>       <th>Total Estimated additional Expenditure (&euro;million per year) per incremental step</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;350</td>       <td>&euro;360</td>       <td>+   &euro;10</td>       <td>&euro;0.53m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;350</td>       <td>&euro;400</td>       <td>+   &euro;50</td>       <td>&euro;2.29m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;350</td>       <td>&euro;450</td>       <td>+   &euro;100</td>       <td>&euro;3.01m</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement. </p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commencing the 2015 Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform it represents.  We are working towards a date of June 2022 for full commencement.   </p>  <p>  The delays in commencement of the 2015 Act arise from two principal factors.  The Decision Support Service, which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act, has to become operational and to be able to respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to be enacted by year end.  Priority drafting has been secured and publication of the Bill is expected in October.  The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  Some provisions of the Act have been commenced to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service; the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group in relation to Advance Healthcare Directives; and most recently, on the 1st of February this year, the repeal of the Marriage of Lunatics Act, which means that a ward can now marry if she or he has capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  To this end a budget of &euro;5.8 million was secured for the Decision Support Service for 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, meets monthly to oversee and drive progress towards full commencement.  The Steering Group comprises senior officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Decision Support Service, recognising that successful operation of the 2015 Act will involve multiple stakeholders.  They are working towards commencement of the 2015 Act in June 2022, with the Decision Support Service opening for business immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

The project was designed to provide a robust evidence base for the further development of high quality ELC and SAC in Ireland. The outputs, including the costs calculator developed through this project inform the development of funding schemes and are being considered by the Expert Group which is working on the development of a new funding model for the sector.</p>  <p>  This Review found that approximately 40% of the total income to the sector comes from parental fees. The remainder came from State supports. This percentage was found to vary significantly across services. Many services rely entirely on State funding while others services rely exclusively on parental fees. In a sustainable service, it is expected that the income to services (from both parental fees and State funding) covers the costs of delivering services with a margin of surplus.</p>  <p>  Over the past year, these income and costs data captured as part of the Review have underpinned the substantial COVID-19 supports secured including the exemption for employers in the sector to the rule in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme of having to demonstrate the reduction in turnover that is required by other employers.</p>  <p>  Data for this Review was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic so the analysis of the breakdown of service income between State investment and parental fees does not take account of the special financial supports that have been made available to the sector since March 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the importance of collecting high quality income and cost data.  This year, a new supplementary income and costs survey has been circulated to all providers alongside the annual Early Years Service Profile survey, administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department. </p>  <p>  The data collected will be essential to assess the impact of the pandemic on the sector and to inform future policy development. The survey deadline is 30 June. Once the data is reviewed and cleaned, decisions will be taken on publication. </p></reply>

The Action Plan sets out a pathway over the next eight years towards regulation, support and subsidies for all paid, non-relative childminders. The Action Plan will involve change and will bring significant benefits for childminders, and for the children and the families using their services.</p>  <p>  A National Action Plan for Childminding Steering Group is in the process of being formed, to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan.  The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and consultation and communications.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders on the Steering Group, which will be chaired by my Department. Additionally the National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders on all four Advisory Groups. </p>  <p>  The National Action Plan itself was based on extensive consultation and engagement with childminders, and the blueprint for the National Action Plan was the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which was coordinated and chaired by Childminding Ireland. The National Action Plan commits to further consultation with childminders, especially during Phase 1 of the Plan when developing regulations specific to childminders.</p>  <p>  While the organisation in question, which represents childminders, temporarily withdrew from processes related to the National Action Plan on 2 June, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that officials in my Department received written confirmation on 5 July that the organisation is now re-engaging in the National Action Plan processes. They have confirmed that they will accept the invitation to take up a seat on the Steering Group for the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Their agreement to re-engage is very welcome as I believe that active engagement and consultation with childminders and their representatives will be a key to successful implementation of the National Action Plan. </p></reply>

The Department has considered the findings of this research concerning the use of voluntary care arrangements as part of this review process. The research findings were also shared with Tusla.</p>  <p>  I plan to very shortly bring forward proposals to Cabinet for reform of the Child Care Act 1991, following an extensive consultation process including a consultation on initial proposals in 2020. One of those proposals concerns amending S4 of the Child Care Act 1991 which regulates voluntary care arrangements. </p>  <p>  The study identifies positive attributes of the existing voluntary care process but also made specific reference to a number of issues such as the unlimited duration of voluntary care agreements and weak mechanisms for ascertaining the views of children. The proposal that I will share with Cabinet colleagues will seek to amend legislation to limit voluntary care arrangements to a maximum of 12 months after which renewal will only be permitted subject to explicit parental consent, where parents have received legal advice. Other important changes include strengthening the voice of the child in both court proceedings as well outside court proceedings including in voluntary care. </p>  <p>  Once Government approval is secured, the drafting of the General Scheme can commence. The finalised Scheme will undergo scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

The onus falls to  all of us to report concerns that a child may have been, is being, or is at risk of being abused or neglected. Tusla has developed a comprehensive referral system through which organisations, the public and mandated people can share their concerns for a child potentially at risk of neglect or abuse. In 2020 there were in excess of 60,000 referrals to Tusla. </p>  <p>  It is not necessary to prove that abuse has occurred to report a concern to Tusla. All that is required is that there are reasonable grounds. It is Tusla&rsquo;s role to assess the information that it receives with any other available information.  A child protection assessment will be carried out where  risk is identified and in other situations.</p>  <p>  Where a referral to Tusla does not reach a threshold for a child protection assessment the referral can be referred to Prevention, Partnership and Family Support (PPFS). The best way to improve outcomes for children is to intervene at an early stage to resolve problems and prevent harm.  PPFS is a comprehensive programme of early intervention and preventative work which has been undertaken by Tusla. The programme takes three main approaches:</p>  <p>  - Supporting the participation of children and young people in decisions that affect them.</p>  <p>  - Supporting parents in developing their parenting skills.</p>  <p>  - Implementing an area-based approach to identifying and addressing needs earlier and in a coordinated manner</p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 places a legal obligation on certain people, many of whom are professionals, to report child protection concerns at or above a defined threshold to Tusla. These mandated persons must also assist Tusla, on request, in its assessment of child protection concerns about children who have been the subject of a mandated report.</p>  <p>  Mandated persons are people who have contact with children and/or families who, by virtue of their role,  qualifications, training and experience, are in a key position to help protect children from harm. Mandated persons include key professionals working with children in the education, health, justice, youth and childcare sectors. Certain professionals who may not work directly with children, such as those in adult counselling or psychiatry, are also mandated persons.</p>  <p>  Tusla operates a National Out of Hours Service (OHS) &amp;amp; Emergency Out of Hours Service (EOHS). Initially established in 2015 incorporating the pre-existing Emergency Place of Safety Service. The core function of the Tusla Out of Hours Social Work Services is to ensure the safety and welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection outside of normal office hours. The service can  provides emergency care placements for children as required and support and assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and foster carers . In 2020 Tusla received 2,281 referrals to the National Out of Hours Service with 583 referrals in Q4 2020 alone. Over 2020 the Out of Hours service placed 525 children in emergency foster care or residential placements. </p>  <p>  In addition all organisations,  including government departments, schools, health services, religious bodies, public sector agencies, clubs and leisure sector, private and voluntary bodies that provide services to children have a duty to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement. This should incorporate</p>  <p>  - promoting the general welfare, health, development and safety of children</p>  <p>  - adopting and consistently applying a safe and clearly defined method of recruiting and selecting staff and volunteers</p>  <p>  - developing tailored guidance and procedures, in accordance with Children First: National Guidance, for staff and volunteers who may have reasonable grounds for concern about the safety and welfare of children involved with the organisation</p>  <p>  - identifying a designated liaison person to act as a liaison with outside agencies and a resource person to any staff member or volunteer who has child protection and welfare concerns. The designated liaison person is responsible for reporting allegations or concerns of child abuse to the Child and Family Agency or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p>  <p>  - ensuring that the organisation has clear written procedures on the action to be taken if allegations of abuse against employees/volunteers are made</p>  <p>  - raising awareness within the organisation about potential risks to children&rsquo;s safety and welfare</p>  <p>  - developing effective procedures for responding to accidents and complaints and should be published or made available on request. </p></reply>

Tusla&rsquo;s work has focused on ensuring continuity of critical supports and services to vulnerable children and families  whilst  balancing this need with  public health advice to keep children, families and frontline staff as safe as possible during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  At the beginning of the pandemic the CEO of Tusla, Bernard Gloster determined that the three priority areas within the organisation were:</p>  <p>  - Child Protection (including Out of Hours Social Work Services)</p>  <p>  - Children in Care (including parental access and court hearings)</p>  <p>  - Domestic and Sexual Gender Based Violence services.</p>  <p>  When Covid-19 restrictions were first introduced, with schools closing in March 2020, referrals decreased  to child protection and welfare services. The decrease was  from an average of 1,505 per week, to 968 (36% decrease) per week for the initial four week period. Following a local and national media campaign referrals increased, to over 1,300 referrals per week. All indications are that year on year comparisons will show an increase in referrals received in 2020. The most recent monthly referral data shows to the end of October 2020 Tusla had received 52,082 referrals, over the same period in 2019 Tusla received 49,963 referrals already an increase of 4%.   </p>  <p>  In June 2020, my Department developed an information and media campaign entitled SupportingChildren.gov.ie. For the first time this brought together information on all the services, structures and supports which are in place for vulnerable children, young people and their families during the Covid pandemic. Critically this also included the range of step-up actions and innovations that were also being advanced to support these groups. I can inform you that this initiative is about to begin again. It is important that this vulnerable cohort of children and their families know that support continues to be available during these challenging times.  </p>  <p>  My Department established a Covid response group. Under the umbrella of this team the various facets of the Department keep me informed as to issues affecting children and young people and the impact of Covid-19. The group collates information on the impact of Covid on a variety of services including Tusla Children Residential services, the Oberstown Campus, Youth services, Domestic Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence services, International Protection Accommodation Service, Traveller and Roma services. They also contribute to and monitor the responses put in place to mitigate issues that arise. </p>  <p>  You will be aware of the heightened concern for the safety of partners and children where there is domestic violence.  The Department of Justice is coordinating a Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) group across  Departments and agencies to ensure a coordinated focussed approach to this worrying problem. Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV.  In Budget 2021, my Department negotiated an additional &euro;30m for Tusla, specifically allocated for DSGBV services. This includes core funding of &euro;28m and an additional &euro;2m to assist DSGBV organisations in offsetting the effects of COVID-19 on day-to-day services.</p>  <p>   The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments regarding DSGBV, including an audit on segmentation of DSGBV responsibilities across government departments and agencies, which will inform future investments in this area. Tusla is also undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. Substantial progress has been made on a number of processes which contribute to the review, including a literature review, consultations with stakeholders, geographical and census data analysis, consultation with service users and policy analysis. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that the report will be published this April.</p>  <p>   It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible, including children.</p>  <p>  In addition through correspondences and parliamentary queries submitted to my Department, issues affecting children and opportunities to prevent abuse and neglect are brought to the fore. During a crisis such as we face now, if anyone has a concern for the safety and welfare of a child or young person they should bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities without delay.</p></reply>

We are in the process of implementing a number of key strategies which are helping to promote inclusion and diversity across Irish society.  The Migrant Integration Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 is one such strategy and, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision was taken to extend the Migrant Integration Strategy to run until the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  The Strategy targets all migrants who are legally in the State. It contains 76 actions which are delivered by Government Departments, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs across a number of policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including employment; education and social inclusion. It also addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach.   </p>  <p>  There are a number of funding streams available to support the integration of migrants.</p>  <p>  - My Department administers a National Funding Programme to promote the Integration of migrants and the National Integration Fund 2020 had funding of &euro;2.2 million available over a three year period.  The Fund supports communities to promote the integration of migrants and their children into Irish society and selected projects will help to combat racism and xenophobia.</p>  <p>  - In addition, the Communities Integration Fund supports local initiatives. There were 112 successful applications who received grants of up to &euro;5,000 under the 2020 Fund.  Applications for the 2021 Communities Integration Fund were open until 2 July 2021 and are now being assessed.  The 2021 Fund also has total funding of &euro;500,000 available for these projects.</p>  <p>  - Funding from European sources also supports migrant integration activities, including the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). The 2019 AMIF allocation provided funding of &euro;4,487,919 to 19 projects - 4 of which operate nationwide.  There are also 4 operating in Dublin, 2 in Cork, and 1 each  in Monaghan, Kildare, Meath,1 in Kildare, 1 in Meath, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Waterford, Mayo and Kerry.</p>  <p>  - The 2016 European Social Fund (ESF) Integration and Employment of Migrants allocated funding of &euro;3,288,498 to 5 projects. Two of the projects operate nationwide and the others were located in Dublin, Meath and Kilkenny. Those projects are due to conclude in 2021 and a funding call for further ESF funding is likely to take place this year.</p></reply>

UBU funded youth services provide out-of-school supports to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people in their communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential.</p><p>The first cycle of <i>UBU Your Place Your Space</i>runs to December 2023 incorporating a new reporting and continuous improvement approach as part of the model. I secured an additional &euro;1 million for the rollout of new services under the scheme in 2021.</p><p>In addition, my Department has worked closely with the youth sector throughout the period of restrictions to ensure that young people most in need of supports continue to receive them. All funding has been maintained fully. </p><p>Finally, I secured an increase of &euro;5 million in funding for youth services in 2021. A total of &euro;66.8 million is being provided to youth services nationwide this year. This additional funding allocated to youth services in 2021 will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide, with a particular view to the role played by youth services in fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people.</p></reply>

The strategies include the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). </p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services. I chair the meetings of the committees charged with the monitoring and oversight of the strategies, with the exception of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy steering group which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities which is chaired by Fergus Finlay.  </p>  <p>  As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective.   </p>  <p>  The role of monitoring the prevalence of discrimination and prejudice in Irish society is undertaken by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) which is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights and equality institution and is an independent public body that accounts directly to the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State. In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department.    </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination, based on socio-economic disadvantaged status, to the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. Work is underway to examine how this commitment can be implemented. </p>  <p>  On 22 June 2021, I announced my intention to conduct a review of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to examine the  functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and promoting equality.  The first phase of a public consultation process will be launched shortly, inviting the views of the public and interested organisations on their own experience of the legislation and where they would recommend amendments. Further consultation will continue in the autumn with a view to bringing legislative proposals on some aspects on the Programme for to Government in 2022. </p></reply>

Due to the impact of the cyber attack on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency's, systems I am happy to provide the latest figures available to the Department. </p><p>Tusla's role is to offer care and protection for children in circumstances where their parents have not been able to provide the care that a child needs. Tusla has a statutory responsibility to provide these services under the provisions the Child Care Act, 1991, the Children Act, 2001 and the Child Care (Amendment) Act, 2007. Children who require admission to care are accommodated through placement in foster care, placement with relatives, or residential care.</p><p>Tusla is committed to the principle that  family life affords the best environment for raising children and the objective of external intervention should be to support families within the community. Tusla's approach is to place children in a family based setting with 91% of children in foster care placements.</p><p>At the end of February there were 5,873 children in the care of Tusla, one more than January 2021 (5,872) and 83 fewer children in care than the same time last year (5,956).</p><p>Of children in care, 91% (5,328) are in foster care, with 65% ( 3,811) in general foster care and 26% ( 1,517) in relative foster care.  A smaller group of children in care 7% ( 426) are in residential placements and 2% (119) are in &ldquo;other&rdquo; care placements, including, for example, specialist disability services and specialist placements abroad. </p><p>At the end of February 2021, 13% (740) of children in care were placed with private providers. This is 14 more than January 2021 (726) and  45 more than February 2020 (695)</p><p>Of the 740, 57% (421) were placed with private in foster care,  eight more than January 2021 (413) and 21 more than February 2021 (400).</p><p>There were 38% (279) of children in placements with private providers were in residential care , six more than January 2021 (273). This number (269) is up 18 on February 2020 (261). The remaining 5% (40) children were in other private placements.</p></reply>

Tusla funds the Health Services Executive to supply psychology services on its behalf. Under existing agreements with the HSE, Tusla pays &euro;7m annually for psychology services provided by the HSE. Tusla also purchases additional therapy services amounting to approximately &euro;4m annually.</p>  <p>  In specific situations,  Tusla offer therapeutic services by directly employed staff, including psychology staff, play therapy, art therapy, Marte Meo, psychotherapy and family therapy.  </p>  <p>  In addition to direct service provision, Tusla provides grant aid to community and voluntary agencies for the provision of a wide range of family support services including specific funding for counselling services. Tusla provides funding to a range of agencies including Barnardos, the Daughters of Charity, Foroige, and Extern Ireland; all of which provide counselling support to children.</p>  <p>  Children placed in foster care or residential care may access services close to their home or placement and there is significant flexibility in the arrangements to match children&rsquo;s needs. For children in the care of Tusla, where there is an essential and critical therapeutic need identified and the HSE is not in a position to respond, private therapeutic services may  accessed. These therapeutic services are accessed based on the unique needs of each child and delivered as part of their care plan.    </p>  <p>  For young people in Special Care, detention, or at risk of requiring same, Tusla provides an Assessment Consultation Therapy Service (ACTS) through a national multidisciplinary clinical team comprised of counsellors with expertise in substance misuse, psychologists, family therapists, social workers, social care workers, and speech and language therapists. This service is based in Dublin with regional teams in Limerick and Cork.</p>  <p>  The team provides assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviour associated with complex clinical needs. ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.</p>  <p>  ACTS offers on-site therapeutic services  on an in reach basis. The service extends into the community for young people at significant risk by continuing involvement with young people following secure care placements when their needs exceed the threshold of community services. </p>  <p>  As a national service ACTS can support young people when they return to community settings to help them re-engage with local mainstream services. ACTS works with young people, staff in residential units, families and carers, local area social workers, school staff and others.</p>  <p>  Tusla works collaboratively with Child and Adolescent  Mental Health Services, the Courts and other services in respect of relevant matters.</p></reply>

The safety measures which will be in place such as social distancing, face masks, ventilation will be in accordance with prevailing public health advice taking into account the essential nature of further and higher education and research.</p>  <p>  Whether students will have the option to continue attending remotely once on-site attendance resumes will be matter for individual institutions, and students seeking further information should engage directly with their institution on this matter.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p>  <p>  The type of issue referred to by the Deputy usually arises where an applicant wishes to apply as an independent Student and is requested to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Article 13(3) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 states that an &ldquo;independent student&rdquo; means a mature student who did not ordinarily reside with his or her parents, or either of them, from October of the year before the first point of entry to an approved post leaving certificate course or an approved higher education course or re-entry to an approved course and where it is established to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that they are eligible on that basis.</p>  <p>  SUSI does not require Rent-a-Room applicants to be registered with the RTB. However, if an applicant is unable to provide any of the accepted documentation listed below and is refused a grant, they may lodge an appeal to the SUSI Appeals Officer. The Appeals Officer may than request additional documents where an applicant provides evidence of their address and the address that their parent(s) resides as evidence of living separately and independently.</p>  <p>   The documentation accepted as evidence of living independently is any of the following;</p>  <p>  -  A letter confirming that the address is registered with Residential Tenancies Board (RTB); </p>  <p>  -  A Local Authority lease agreement or a letter confirming the applicant's rental under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) or any Government housing scheme/arrangement. Private housing lease agreements will not be accepted; </p>  <p>  -  A letter on headed paper from a Rental Agency confirming the applicant's tenancy; </p>  <p>  -  A letter confirming the receipt and period of Rent Allowance, Mortgage Interest Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP); </p>  <p>  -  A utility bill in the applicant's own name, for example; landline telephone, fixed broadband, gas, electricity, cable/satellite television bill, home heating bills, waste bills, mortgage statements and/or property tax letters. SUSI does not accept mobile telephone bills. If the utility bills in the household are in the applicant's spouse&rsquo;s name, a marriage certificate should be provided with the utility bill. If an applicant is co-habiting, SUSI will accept utility bills in the applicant's partner&rsquo;s name covering the relevant period together with correspondence e.g. bank statement/Statement of Liability issued to the applicant at the same address and covering the relevant period; and/or </p>  <p>  -  Official documentation posted to the applicant at the address and relating to the applicant's residence there. For example, a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming Rent Allowance at the address. It should be noted that SUSI do not accept bank statements alone for this purpose. </p>  <p>  A letter confirming registration with the RTB is one of the forms of documentation which SUSI accepts for independent residency; however, SUSI do not require applicants to be registered with the RTB.</p>  <p>  Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: susi.ie/eligibility/applicant-class/.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p><p>A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p><p>However, there are points at which a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student. These are where he/she:</p><p>-  Progresses from further education to higher education.</p><p>-  Is returning following a 3 year break in studies.  </p><p>-  Is returning as a &quot;second chance&quot; student after a five year break in studies.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for student grant applications is a matter for the centralised grant awarding authority, SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland).</p><p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student.

The aim of the scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college. The existing rules reflect the fact that very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents, where their parents have sufficient means, while in full-time education. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government, a review of the Student Grant Scheme is currently underway and is due to report in Autumn 2021.  A public consultation process closed in April with over 280 submissions received. The views of students were sought via an online survey process in May and over 9,000 survey responses were received. It is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review.</p></reply>

Among these are young people, part time workers, those in the hospitality sector, the lower skilled and those with lower educational attainment. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the labour market and skills effects of the pandemic, a range of measures were introduced as a response to upskilling and reskilling needs of individuals and businesses through the July Jobs Stimulus and Budget 2021.  These measures are providing 35,000 education and training places to help those who were displaced by the effects of the pandemic. A further 15,000 places were announced as part of the skills package in Budget 2021. Combined these measures include places on the Skills to Complete initiative, additional places through Skillnet supported programmes, funding of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation scheme, the roll-out of retrofit training across the country, additional places through Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative, and the expansion of the range of short-duration, part-time and online upskilling and reskilling offerings available for recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p><p>Evidence and research on Ireland&rsquo;s current and future skills needs and job opportunity indicators are monitored by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit  in SOLAS, on behalf of the National Skills Council, and are summarised annually in the National Skills Bulletin. We know that it is critical that people and businesses can avail of opportunities for developing skills in the way that suits them best, no matter who they are or what sector they are in, in order to overcome these impacts, and that we ensure that our growth as a society is sustainable and inclusive.</p><p>Significant work has been undertaken in terms of the potential skills impact of the pandemic across the country and has included a focus on occupations, regions and potential profiles of learners. Upskilling and reskilling opportunities are currently available across many sectors and, through national engagement, scope has been extended to consider the prioritisation of skills. </p><p>The Skills to Advance initiative, which enables targeted skills development for vulnerable employees, was developed in response to evolving skill needs and assists those facing changes in their work due to technology advances, changing work practices and market diversification. Opportunities offered through Skills to Advance incorporate digital, socio-emotional and technical skills development to enhance employee skills and support increased productivity in Irish SMEs.  </p><p>A key feature of Skills to Advance is the identification of skills gaps and needs with employers to develop customised training solutions for their workforce.  In addition, specific initiatives are being taken at sectoral and regional level to provide novel upskilling opportunities for those in areas of work at risk of displacement and to reskill people for emerging work opportunities.</p><p>There are currently a number of opportunities to develop transferable skillsets in a range of areas to include:</p><p><b>-  Leadership and management</b>which provides critical upskilling to support employees in a wide range of sectors.</p><p><b>-  Developing Leaders for Hospitality and Tourism</b>which provides upskilling opportunities for team leads and supervisors and a career path to upskill in the sector.</p><p>Areas currently being scoped out and developed also include:</p><p>-  SME Digi-Skills Initiative to boost business performance in SMEs</p><p>-  Green Skills initiative to provide cross sectoral upskilling opportunities in green skills.</p><p>-  eCollege is the national further education and training online learning service. eCollege offers very flexible online learning and is ideal for those wishing to study at their own pace around their work and life commitments, and so is a valuable support to those looking to reskill or gain skills to support transition to other sectors. eCollege offers courses in office productivity, business, web and graphic design, computer programming, data science and IT professional subject areas.  </p><p>In response to the impact of the pandemic on employment levels and the requirement to provide reskilling initiatives, my department has also engaged with Skillnet Ireland who have developed the <b>Skills Connect</b>scheme in partnership with industry. Through Skills Connect, Skillnet Ireland is achieving cross-sector employability by enabling jobseekers secure new employment opportunities in high-growth areas such as medtech manufacturing, cyber security, wind energy, software programming, digital marketing, customer service, and logistics/ warehousing. Skills Connect was introduced in July 2020 as a rapid and agile response to the emerging needs of businesses, regions and impacted workers.</p></reply>

Many adults do not have the right skills to succeed in the new, interconnected, digital world and are disengaged from learning. Basic digital skills are important across all sectors and will help mitigate against automation risks and provide a platform for workers to upskill.</p>  <p>  Reflecting this and in line with the Programme for Government, I tasked SOLAS, with the development of a new 10 year strategy for adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. I plan to bring this new Strategy to Government for approval shortly.</p>  <p>  A range of programmes are provided within Education and Training Boards (ETBs) for individuals who wish to develop their digital literacy. Basic ICT tuition is integrated within adult literacy and numeracy provision. The majority of digital literacy provision is free of charge or is heavily subsidised.</p>  <p>  The Skills to Compete initiative, which was developed in response to the urgent need for activation, upskilling and reskilling as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, offer courses built around three key priorities: delivering the essential skills required for modern workplaces; building strong digital skills; and developing the specific vocational skills to secure opportunities in growing sectors and occupations.</p>  <p>  E College is a leading learning platform that delivers online training courses in business, project management, information technology, graphic design, web design, digital marketing, software development and basic computer literacy. These courses are all industry recognised programmes, accessed on a continuous intake basis, and enable flexible learning for  unemployed learners, workers in sectors vulnerable to automation with skills levels below NFQ level 5, and those over 50 years of age. eCollege courses are temporarily being made available free of charge to all as an additional support to those impacted by Covid-19 containment measures.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are currently 5 apprenticeships available in the ICT sector and a Software Solutions Architect apprenticeship which is expected to be offered at level 9 on the NFQ is in development.  The apprenticeships currently available at level 6 are Network Engineer Associate, Software Developer Associate, Cybersecurity and Telecommunications and Data Network Engineering Technician and at level 8 there is CGI Technical Artist (Animation, Games, VFX).  </p>  <p>  Skillnet Ireland is supporting indigenous SMEs to enhance digital skills and is implementing several digital skills actions assigned to the agency in both the National Skills Strategy and Technology Skills 2022. Skillnet Ireland are prioritising programmes that address the digital skills gap in SMEs, that prepare SMEs for the digital transformation and that maximise the use of technology to improve both the productivity and innovation of SMEs. In 2020, 10,000 digital skills training places were provided by Skillnet Ireland that delivered a total of 150,000 training days.  All programmes were funded on a cost sharing basis with employers.</p>  <p>  To enhance the availability of advanced and high level ICT skills, Technology Skills 2022, seeks to deliver 47,000 IT Graduates by 2022 and sets out the priority actions which will be undertaken in the four-year period 2019-2022 to meet the demands for high-level ICT skillsets in the Irish economy. It sets out to provide appropriate education and training pathways for people to train, learn and upskill in a variety of high-level ICT skills which are sought after by a diverse range of industries to support and drive economic performance over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Springboard+ 2021 was launched on 14th June 2021, providing 10,158 higher education places on 294 courses. As a result of multi-annual funding of graduate conversion courses, this leads to a combined total of 13,128 places in 399 courses available in the 2021/22 academic year under Springboard+ 2021 and HCI Pillar 1. </p>  <p>  Courses available under Springboard+ 2021 include high level ICT, and courses in new and emerging technologies. 1,451 places are available on 36 courses in high level ICT skills. </p>  <p>  The majority of courses approved under Springboard+ 2021 and HCI Pillar 1 will start in 2021 and in early 2022. Full details on Springboard+ and HCI courses, the eligibility criteria and how to apply can be found on the website: www.springboardcourses.ie.</p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan can be accessed here.</p><p>The Plan reflects the essential nature of higher and further education and training, and research activities, and in that context, provides for comprehensive on-site activity for the next academic year, with almost full scale on-site activities.</p><p>Under the Plan, larger scale lectures will take place on-site if the public health situation continues to improve as expected but some moderation in numbers may still be required.</p><p>Contingency planning, based on a more restrictive public health environment, is also being prepared by the sector. Even in a more restrictive public health environment, it is envisaged that there would still be significant on-site activities. At a very minimum, workshops, tutorials, classroom based activities and smaller lectures will be allowed and libraries, research facilities and labs will be opened.</p><p>The safety measures which will be in place such as social distancing, face masks, ventilation will be in accordance with prevailing public health advice taking into account the essential nature of further and higher education and research. Institutions and providers will continue to put in place plans to ensure that the overall number of people on campus at a given time continues to be moderated.</p><p>The Plan will operate along with and be supported by:</p><p>-  The COVID-19 Adaptation Framework </p><p>-  Practical Guidance for Further and Higher Education, (to be updated in line with prevailing public health advice).</p><p>-  Sectoral guidance (to be updated in line with prevailing public health advice): FET Implementation Guidelines</p><p>-  Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in Higher Education Institutions </p><p>-  Sectoral Pact as outlined in Section 5 of the plan</p><p>-  Work Safely Protocol published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</p><p>-  The Government Plan - COVID &ndash; 19 Resilience and Recovery: The Path Ahead</p><p>The Safe Return Plan also includes a Pact of actions and commitments which my Department, its agencies, stakeholders, institutions and providers have agreed to in order to support ongoing efforts in relation to the pandemic and to ensure that planning is well-grounded in safe and sustainable practices.  These actions and commitments, which will be completed in time for autumn 2021, are grouped under the following headings:</p><p>-  Careful and safe opening up on-site</p><p>-  Ongoing managing and monitoring of on-site activities with continued compliance by all within an expanded Discretionary Framework for the sector.</p><p>-  Promoting public health</p><p>-  Dealing with outbreaks</p><p>-  A new vigilance scheme</p><p>-  Regular and transparent communications</p><p>-  Specific actions and commitments for key areas: research; on-site accommodation; and international learners</p><p>While the vaccination rollout plan continues to accelerate with the announcement that the 18-34 year old cohort may begin registration for vaccination from Monday 5<sup>th</sup>July, however, the challenges associated with the unpredictability of the virus remain particularly in light of the emergence of the Delta variant of the virus. Nevertheless, the sector is committed to maximising onsite provision for students and learners for September 2021 and on that basis and in line with the Safe Return Plan, institutions and providers are currently progressing their own detailed planning and work for a comprehensive return to on-site activity, while recognising that there can be no certainty in relation to the future trajectory of the disease and contingency plans will continue to be necessary.</p><p>My Department has undertaken to provide Government in mid-July with an update of the progress in relation to sectoral planning arising from the Plan and the expected level of on-site activity in further and higher education and research in the Autumn, including an update on planning with regard to large scale lectures. This will ensure that there is ongoing support for planning in this sector and that planning proceeds in a manner that is aligned to prevailing public health advice.</p><p>Following the update to Cabinet in July and in anticipation, at that point, of revised public health guidelines being available, it is envisaged that institutions and providers will be in a position to communicate their plans for a return to on-site activity to students, learners and staff.</p><p>The partnership and collaboration demonstrated by all stakeholders, institutions and educational providers, their staff and representative bodies, students and learners has been instrumental in developing the plan for the safe return to onsite provision of higher and further education.

This Act was signed by the President on 18 March 2021 and came into effect on 23-24 April 2021.</p>  <p>  This Directive builds upon the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive to better equip the Union to prevent the financial system from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, this Act ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime. It enhances the range of measures countering money laundering by reflecting modern developments. It will also help to bring us in line with our EU obligations.</p>  <p>  While the Act transposes many of the elements of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the Department of Finance is also engaged in giving effect to other provisions of the Directive. The Department of Finance is currently progressing elements of the transposition including with respect to the centralised bank account registry. I am advised that a central register of trusts, required under Article 31 of the Directive was established in April 2021. This register is operated by the Revenue Commissioners and will begin to accept filings in the coming months. A central register of bank and payment accounts and safe-deposit boxes under Article 32a, which will be operated by the Central Bank of Ireland, is currently being progressed. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice on 14 May 2020, which is the first stage of infringement proceedings. Ireland had four months to reply, which it did in September 2020. The second stage would be the issue of a Reasoned Opinion, and only at the third stage (a reference to the Court of Justice) would possible financial penalties be applicable.</p>  <p>  Ireland has informed the Commission of the significant progress made in transposing this instrument into Irish law. The Commission received comprehensive detail regarding the various national provisions which transpose or will transpose each of the provisions of the Directive including the text of the Act. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the Commission and keep the Commission informed of our progress in transposing the Fifth Directive.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2020, Ireland was ordered by the Court of Justice of the European Union to pay a fine of &euro;2m in respect of its failure to fully transpose the previous Directive (the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive) on time. The Court&rsquo;s decision related to a period between July 2017 and the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act in November 2018.</p></reply>

This followed on from the work of a sub-group of the Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour, which I chair, to consider community-based approaches to address the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes as part of the overall package of Government measures to tackle the issue.</p>  <p>  This initiative is centred around Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) who are being invited to lead on the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.  GYDPs will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority.  It is envisaged that the local authority partner will in general be responsible for provision of tracks and related facilities.</p>  <p>  In May, my Department invited the GYDPs to present proposals for the scheme to offer positive alternatives to young people engaged in anti-social use of scramblers, including specific contact with GYDPs in areas that are most affected by this issue. </p>  <p>  The community-based initiative is open to receive proposals from local areas, coordinated through GYDPs, and it is open to any GYDP to submit a proposal. The intention is that proposals submitted before the end of July may be eligible for support in the current year, subject to assessment of the details of the proposal. I can assure the Deputy that I will keep the operation of the scheme under review, with a view to providing appropriate support for local areas where there are significant problems with the misuse of scramblers, quad bikes and similar vehicles.</p>  <p>  I should stress that this initiative is focussed on young people at risk of crime and anti-social behaviour and specifically anti-social use of these vehicles.  It is not intended to duplicate the responsibilities of mainstream youth services or to fund motocross or similar sports as such.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, while at the same time creating alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, members of the public who are concerned about any individual misuse of scramblers should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding local authorities powers&rsquo; to make bye-laws, this important piece of legislation introduces changes in the law to allow for the sale and consumption of alcohol in relevant outdoor seating areas, where those outdoor seating areas have been permitted by the relevant local authority on public land, or where they are on private land abutting the licensed premises, as provided for in the Act. </p>  <p>  These relevant outdoor seating areas are deemed to be part of the licensed premises while this legislation remains in force. As the Deputy will be aware, the Act has been introduced in response to the unique circumstances of the pandemic and therefore is time-bound.  The provisions of the Act will remain in place until 30 November 2021, but can be extended for up to 6 months at a time, if a resolution is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Importantly, this legislation provides the clarity that has been sought and ensures that we can deliver on the Government&rsquo;s commitments for an outdoor summer and to give certainty to thousands of businesses and their staff that they can remain open and continue to serve their customers in a safe and compliant way.</p>  <p>  The Act preserves the existing obligations on licence holders, including to maintain good order on their licensed premises. Failure to do so will be grounds for objection to the renewal of the licence, even if, at the time of renewal, the licensee has ceased to operate the outdoor seating area.</p>  <p>  The Act also makes it an offence not to comply with a direction by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take any steps necessary to ensure compliance with the licensing legislation. This is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to 6 months. Compliance with the relevant COVID-19 health regulations will also apply to outdoor seating areas.</p>  <p>  The Justice Plan 2021, published on 22 February, commits to reviewing and modernising alcohol licensing. </p>  <p>  My Department is actively engaged with the Night-Time Economy Taskforce looking at innovative approaches to support and develop a vibrant, diverse night-time culture and economy in Ireland. The work of the Taskforce is ongoing and has included wide stakeholder engagement. A key challenge identified by stakeholders is the outdated alcohol licensing legislation and this will be reflected in the report of the Taskforce. I am working with my colleague Minister Catherine Martin and the Taskforce to support the work of the Taskforce and implement its recommendations without delay. It is my firm intention that this reform will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to bring forward legislation that will contain proposals to update the law relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs, by replacing both the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 with streamlined provisions more suited to modern conditions. </p>  <p>  While trading hours for licenses premises will be part of that legislative review, in the context of the current curtailment of the opening hours of licensed premises this is a matter that the Department of Health monitors as part of the Covid regulations. It should be borne in mind that, in the context of supporting business to operate in outdoor seating areas, extended hours are not suitable for many licensed premises operating in these outdoor areas in light of community and neighbourhood concerns. There is a balance of considerations in all such decisions.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, this will involve a range of measures and initiatives to improve how our courts, and the sector that supports it, operate.  </p>  <p>  Regarding costs, the general rule, now provided for in statute in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, is that costs, as defined in that Act, are awarded to a successful litigant unless the court directs otherwise for reasons specified in that legislation.  </p>  <p>  Last year, Minister McEntee published the Report of the Review Group set up to review and make recommendations to reform the administration of civil justice. The Review Group, chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, made 95 specific recommendations to make the civil justice system more efficient and easier for people to access. </p>  <p>  Regarding lay litigants, the Review Group recommended that the practice direction regarding lay litigants be implemented by the High Court Central Office. A practice direction was introduced in the High Court in July 2010 governing proceedings in which one or more of the parties does not have professional legal representation requiring that the litigant in person and the other party complete, file and (where applicable) serve a form in advance of (a) making a pre-trial application and (b) the trial of the proceedings, to assist in identifying the factual and legal issues requiring to be addressed at the hearing. </p>  <p>  My Department is in the final stages of developing a multi-year implementation plan which will set out changes to be made in all areas of civil justice, including litigation costs, case delays, and access to services and legal aid. Once completed, the implementation plan will be brought to Government and published. The extensive reforms proposed by the Review Group will transform the experience of those seeking to access civil justice in Ireland.</p></reply>

This falls significantly below the high standards that the public expect from the Garda&iacute; and the high standards that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na set for themselves. I am particularly concerned that anyone experiencing domestic abuse, and indeed anyone in a vulnerable position, who summoned the courage to seek assistance may not have received it.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the apology that has been made by the Garda Commissioner and the Commissioner has assured me that when someone calls 999 now, they can expect and trust that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will help. That should of course always be the case. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to the Secretary General of my Department on 4 December 2020 to inform the Department that a number of 999 calls had been cancelled on the AGS Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was carrying out a review of the reasons behind this. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also brought the issue to the attention of the Policing Authority the same month. Minister McEntee wrote to the Policing Authority on 5 February 2021 to request that the Authority oversee the review being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. </p>  <p>  Following Minister McEntee's request, the Policing Authority wrote to Minister McEntee with updates on 17 February 2021 and 27 April 2021 and to myself with an update on 7 June 2021. The Garda Commissioner wrote to me with an update on 16 June. I have also been briefed by both the Commissioner and the Chair of the Authority.</p>  <p>  Once the Authority has completed its work, I will examine its conclusions and take any action that needs to be taken on foot of its report.</p></reply>

Staff have worked both on-site and remotely since the pandemic began to ensure the protection process continues to operate and I am grateful to them for their dedication.</p><p>Physical attendance in the office has been strictly limited in line with public health guidance. Ensuring the safety of applicants, legal representatives and staff has resulted in additional logistical challenges that have limited the processing of applications and efforts to improve processing times, including the target set to make first instance decisions in the vast majority of cases within 9 months.</p><p>Despite these challenges, 2,276 applications for international protection were processed to completion last year &ndash; just under 67% of the total achieved in 2019.</p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that at the end of May 2021, there were 5,035 international protection cases pending at the IPO and 590 cases pending in the Ministerial Decisions Unit.</p><p>The median processing times for determinations made by the IPO in 2020 for all cases was 17.6 months and for prioritised cases was 12.7 months. </p><p>The median processing time for all cases processed to completion in the IPO in Q1 2021 was 22.2 months, and 16.1 months for prioritised cases.</p><p>While the International Protection Office makes a first instance recommendation, decisions in respect of international protection are made by the Ministerial Decisions Unit.</p><p>The median processing time for cases completed in the Ministerial Decisions Unit in Q1 2021 was 0.2 months. The median processing time for decisions made by the Ministerial Decisions Unit in 2020 was 1.6 months. </p><p>My Department's main focus now is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.  </p><p>My Department is committed to implementing the key recommendations in the Expert Advisory Group Report to reduce processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and Establish a New International Protection Support Service.</p><p>Work is under way in my Department towards identifying mechanisms which<i></i>will assist with this. For example, additional ICT resources have been secured for this year, and detailed practical work, including the end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from within my Department, has now been completed. </p><p>A number of initiatives have already been introduced, including the relocation of the Ministerial Decisions Unit to the IPO premises to improve work processes; the designation of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal as a body authorised to hold remote hearings; and the holding of virtual interviews with some applicants living outside of Dublin by the IPO resumed on 10 May.</p><p>The IPO has also put in place a range of measures to improve efficiencies across a number of work streams, such as accelerated procedures, implementation of non-cooperation measures, and initiatives to speed up the return of completed questionnaires from applicants. A new, shorter and more user-friendly questionnaire is being used since 28 June and the IPO has also agreed a new prioritisation schedule with UNHCR that is effective from 14 June.</p></reply>

This has been advised to GPs by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

The potential adverse consequences of period poverty for women, girls and others who identify as non-binary or transgender who have periods are widely accepted internationally.  These include recurrent exclusion from educational, employment and social settings during menstruation and health impacts resulting from exclusion and the use of unsuitable period products.</p><p>Period poverty in Ireland was initially brought into focus by the publication, in late 2018, of a Plan International Survey of 1,100 teenage girls, aged 12-19. The Survey identified 50% of girls as having occasionally experienced period poverty, and 10% as having used unsuitable products as a result. 61% had missed school on occasion because of their period. </p><p>Following the publication of the Survey, the Parliamentary Women&rsquo;s Caucus proposed motions in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il in early 2019, which were passed. Following the Oireachtas motions, the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG) Strategy Committee, now led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, established a sub-committee on period poverty in 2019, chaired by the Department of Health. </p><p>In line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas motions, Sub-Committee&rsquo;s remit included establishing the extent of period poverty in Ireland and population cohorts most at risk. The Terms of Reference also included giving due consideration to the circumstances of young people under the age of 25, targeting of high-risk groups, stigma reduction and mainstreaming period poverty mitigation measures across all relevant Government Departments and public bodies. </p><p>In addition, the Programme for Government 2020, makes the following specific commitment under &lsquo;Better Opportunities through Education and Research&rsquo; - &ldquo;<i>Provide a range of free, adequate, safe, and suitable period products in all educational publicly-funded settings (including schools, colleges and HEIs), to ensure that no students are disadvantaged in their education by period poverty</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>The NSWG Sub-Committee on Period Poverty published its report on 8th February, 2021; the full Report and accompanying press release are available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/264f4-period-poverty-in-ireland-discussion-paper-period-poverty-sub-committee-national-strategy-for-women-and-girls-20172020-february-2021/  </p><p>Moreover, Government has supported a Private Members Bill on Period Poverty; the Free Provision of Period Products Bill 2021 (Bill 4), proposed by Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee and sponsored by Senators Catherine Ardagh and Mary Fitzpatrick, which seeks to make period products freely available to all those who need them. A debate on the matter was held in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 8th February, 2021; the Bill has now passed to Committee stage.</p><p>Government has further agreed that the recommendations of the Period Poverty in Ireland Discussion Paper be taken into account in terms of further development of the Bill and that cross-Government, inter-Departmental, interagency and societal support for the Bill and related implementation measures should be sought, including from voluntary and private sector organisations that provide services funded by the State, as well as from public service providers. The recommendations of the Report include, but are not limited to, consideration of the provision of free period products in public buildings and in the context of education.</p><p>The Department of Health is currently establishing an Implementation Group, with representation requested from all Government Departments, to achieve cross sectoral input and to co-ordinate oversight of both the Bill and implementation measures recommended in the Discussion Paper. It is envisaged that the work of the Group will address the indignity experienced by those who may need period products every month, but cannot afford them. </p><p>Both myself and my Department are aware of the work currently undertaken by the recently established Youth Advisory Panel (YAP) with the Ombudsman For Children on the issue of period poverty.  We are also aware of the statement made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child&rsquo;s General comment No 20 (2016) on the implementation of the rights of the child during adolescence. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce this legislation and to confiscate supplies of this drug. </p>  <p>  Last year, following media reports regarding the increased use of nitrous oxide, the Dept of Health requested the HSE to gather evidence on the use of nitrous oxide nationally. The HSE identified that use was occurring among those under the age of 18 in some communities and, as a result of this, a locally targeted approach was recommended to create awareness of the use of this substance. This approach is in line with best practice, as targeting young populations with a wider media campaign may have had limitations regarding effectiveness.</p>  <p>  The HSE and local drug and alcohol task forces have taken a pro-active approach to communicating with parents and youth workers the dangers associated with nitrous oxide. A number of webinars were hosted with the aim of up-skilling local professionals regarding the use of nitrous oxide. Speakers at these events included a UK professional, the HSE, and professionals from the local areas. New content on nitrous oxide has been added to the Drugs.ie website, as well as a harm reduction material. </p>  <p>  The HSE has run a number of social media adverts through their Drugs.ie page targeting parents with advice on how to talk to their children about drugs and new drug trends. This work is on-going and will continue throughout July and August. Social media adverts aimed at populations over the age of 18 are also run by the HSE regarding the effects and associated risks of nitrous oxide. The HSE will also develop a series of factsheets containing information on new drug trends such as nitrous oxide. </p>  <p>  In order to provide further data on its use, nitrous oxide was included in the Irish module as part of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction EU Web Survey in March 2021. The findings from this survey will help identify the level and patterns of use among participants. The results from this survey will be released later this year.</p>  <p>  An objective of the national drugs strategy to prevent the use of drugs and alcohol at a young age. School-based and out-of-school programmes are provided to increase awareness of the harms of drug and alcohol use among young people. </p>  <p>  A national drug awareness programme &lsquo;Know the Score&rsquo; was launched in 2019. The resource is aimed at engaging young people in exploring and considering a wide range of topics related to the risks associated with alcohol and drugs. This programme was developed in partnership between public health and education professionals. </p>  <p>  Last year, the Department of Health provided &euro;100,000 to the HSE to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. With this funding the HSE are developing a number of new educational resources which are expected to be publicly available later this year. New drug trends will be included in this work where appropriate. </p>  <p>  I am very supportive of the efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in confiscating supplies of nitrous oxide. I am committed to continuing to resource harm reduction and education campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the risks of drug use, including nitrous oxide.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p>  <p>  On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p>  <p>  On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). </p>  <p>  The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by: </p>  <p>  - protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p>  <p>  - facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; </p>  <p>  - improving transparency and fairness.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available here: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/</p></reply>

Indicators of disease incidence are all now increasing.</p><p>On 29 June, Government announced the next phase of reopening the economy and society in line with <i>Recovery and Resilience: The Path Ahead,</i>with an emphasis on lower risk activities given the risks posed by the Delta variant. Higher risk indoor activities, including organised events, service in bars and restaurants, group training, exercise and dance will not yet recommence, pending the implementation of a system to verify vaccination or immunity status.  </p><p>In line with the delay to other July measures, the current advice is that religious celebrations and ceremonies (outside of weddings and funerals) should not go ahead in July as previously signalled. This is in recognition of the multi household, multi-generational nature of these events and linked social activities and is a response to concerns from public health across the regions in relation to gatherings of this nature.</p><p>Church leaders have been very supportive of the overall national public health response to date and the Government will continue to work with them to ensure that all ceremonies can return when it is safe to do so. </p><p>While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p><p>Significant and sustained progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.</p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which is having a significant impact on acute hospitals. The HSE is focusing on urgent and time critical appointments and procedures until this incident is resolved. Once the incident is resolved the focus will return to restoring routine elective services.</p><p>My Department does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are putting in place plans to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the 13th of May 2021 there were 4,275 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,437 in January 2019.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently in the process of finalising a Multiannual Waiting List plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13th May 2021. The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons on the waiting list for outpatient eye care treatment and inpatient eye care treatment by county is outlined in the attached document. This information is based on the latest available data provided by the NTPF. </p></reply>

As the pandemic continued, additional support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been delivered through the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  As of 11th June 2021, 7,148 claims had been submitted as part of the Scheme. In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing high level of risk associated with COVID-19 during this period, the Department of Health responded by extending the scheme twice, far beyond the originally planned timescale of three months. The further extension of the scheme was outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19', published in September 2020. This provided reassurance of the Scheme&rsquo;s availability and a planned timeframe of operation to the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  The cessation of TAPS at the end of June, as planned and preciously announced was communicated with all  relevant stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland &ndash; the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health held a meeting with Nursing Homes Ireland, the national representative body for private and voluntary nursing homes, on May 25th to discuss the future plans for TAPS. Taking on board the concerns expressed by NHI and all other available advice, the decision was made to discontinue TAPS at the end of June 2021, as previously planned. A letter was issued to NHI dated June 4th 2021 informing them of this decision.</p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community and in nursing homes due to the rollout of the National Vaccination Programme &ndash; COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes are now at a very low level compared with the first quarter of the year and, overall, the epidemiological situation is very positive. It is the Department&rsquo;s understanding that currently there is one open outbreak in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  (Please note that the cyber-attack on the HSE on 14 May 2021 has prevented the routine notification of cases, associated deaths and outbreaks of COVID-19 to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system. As an interim measure, provisional epidemiological reports are being prepared but have not undergone the data validation procedures undertaken through CIDR. For this reason, data continues to be provisional at this time.)</p>  <p>  The Scheme has fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. Availability of outbreak assistance is subject to the overall sanctioned amount of &euro;42m for 2021.</p>  <p>  The substantial package of non-financial supports outlined below will continue to be provided for the time being:</p>  <p>  - Provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The continued supply of PPE is a key support mechanism and will be provided in line with clinical and public health recommendations;</p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Response Teams established to support Public Health Outbreak teams covering all residential services as well as home support settings. All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;</p>  <p>  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;</p>  <p>  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.</p>  <p>  - IPC support and advice;</p>  <p>  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.</p>  <p>  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services and measures, such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.</p>  <p>  In February 2021, a revised plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2021 Plan: The Path Ahead' was published by the Government. This plan recognises the need for longer-term reform of both older persons and nursing home care, broadly reflecting the lessons learned from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel and the pandemic. However, these structural reforms, including the policy and regulatory framework, extend beyond the scope of a temporary financial support scheme aimed at a specific, time-limited public health objective.</p></reply>

Services</p><p>b. Finance and Assets</p><p>c. Communications</p><p>d. Human Resources.  </p><p>I am very conscious that SJOGCS has played a significant role in the delivery of vital disability services and supports to service users and their families across the State for many years and the key focus at present is to ensure that the organisation is facilitated to maintain its important service delivery role into the future in line with a reformed model of care. </p><p>Accordingly, in parallel with the work on the transition plan, the HSE is encouraging SJOGCS to engage in a Sustainability Impact Assessment, which would provide the  organisation with a pathway to financial and operational sustainability and enable the organisation to remain in service provision. </p><p>I understand that the HSE is engaging with the families of service users in relation to the overall process. I would like to assure the Deputy that the needs of services users and their families are at the forefront of all considerations and decision-making in relation to the reform process.</p><p>The HSE has met with the NPFFA on dates in March, May and June. Across the next three months the HSE will meet with the NPFFA on a fortnightly basis. I am advised by the HSE that there is an open communication channel both through phone call and / or email between the HSE and National PFFA reps as required. In addition, on the 28<sup>th</sup>June two PFFA reps were on-boarded to the Communications Work stream as part of the four workstreams regarding the transition programme from SJOGCS to the HSE.</p><p>My foremost concern, which is shared by the HSE, is to ensure the continuity of appropriate disability services delivery by SJOGCS in line with strong governance mechanisms in a cost-effective and equitable manner consistent with care and support needs.</p></reply>

They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements. </p>  <p>  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in a pilot group of 50 section 39 organisations who are funded by way of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Pay restoration commenced with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019.  Any outstanding balance was and will be paid in two equal amounts in October 2020 and October 2021.</p>  <p>  The agreement reached at the WRC noted that some of the organisations (approximately 250) which did not form part of the pilot phase are also likely to have pay restoration issues. A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 SLA funded organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The list of section 39 organisations that was compiled, included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the WRC agreement. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that there is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process. </p></reply>

Members of the Oireachtas will be advised as soon as the HSE is again in a position to provide responses to PQs and are encouraged to resubmit their Parliamentary Questions at that point.  </p>  <p>  Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities. The pandemic and associated restrictions has had a profound impact across society and especially for our older population.  </p>  <p>  All Community Health Organisations through the National Older Persons Office were requested in April 2021 to provide information on the status of their Day Care Services in order to ascertain the level of service that could resume on receipt of updated public health guidance.  As a result, it was intended that approximately 100 day centres would re-open week beginning 5 July. It was also intended that an additional 55 centres would resume in July and August, with a further 90 centres that require works expected to reopen before the end of the year.   It was indicated that these dates may be subject to change as the HSE continues to deal with the significant challenge of the on-going cyber attack.  </p>  <p>  Since then updated Public Health guidance to support the re-opening of Day Care Services for Older People was provided in June 2021 to facilitate re-opening plans. Following on from this a further information request issued to HSE Services to obtain an update on re-opening plans. Their responses are currently being analysed and further detail regarding the re-opening of services is expected imminently.  It is intended that the re-opening of centres will commence this month.</p>  <p>  A Day Care Focus Group which was established in 2020 will remain in place (representative of both HSE and voluntary sector) to oversee the resumption of day care services and provide feedback in relation to both service delivery and users of the services.</p>  <p>  While services may have to operate at a reduced capacity, initially, this is a huge step forward in the resumption of day centres for older people. It follows extensive planning by the HSE and has been made possible by the advanced stage and positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccination programme among our older population. </p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p><p>Mandatory hotel quarantine is also necessary in circumstances where passengers coming from non-designated states do not provide evidence that they have a negative or &lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result from a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival into Ireland. </p><p>As of 17th April, passengers who are fully vaccinated and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance.</p><p>Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered fully vaccinated. </p><p>The following table sets out the definition of &lsquo;fully vaccinated&rsquo;; <table>    <tr>       <th>Type of Vaccine</th>       <th>You are regarded as fully vaccinated after</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pfizer-BioNtech</td>       <td>7 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Moderna</td>       <td>14 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oxford-AstraZeneca</td>       <td>15 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen</td>       <td>14 days after single dose</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Fully vaccinated travellers are still required to have a negative pre-departure RT-PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p><p>Ireland supports the EU Procurement Process, the purpose of which is to secure safe and efficacious vaccines for EU citizens.</p><p>Covid 19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. No vaccine will be used until Market Authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p><p>The delivery of vaccines under APAs that the Commission has negotiated on behalf of Member States are predicated upon a CMA being obtained from the Commission (on the basis of a positive recommendation being awarded by the EMA).</p><p>The awarding of a CMA provides a high level of assurance that a vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has met the requirements of the independent regulatory process as regards demonstrating its safety and efficacy.</p><p>The Sinopharm vaccine has not been awarded a CMA to date.</p></reply>

Under the current measures, travellers arriving into Ireland from overseas (including from Great Britain) are required to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form, to present evidence of a negative pre-departure RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival and to observe mandatory quarantine.  </p>  <p>  Travellers from non-designated countries, including Great Britain, must observe 14 days of Home Quarantine which can be shortened on receipt of a not-detected RT-PCR test result 5 days after arrival. Those who travel from Great Britain, who are not fully vaccinated are now requested to remain in quarantine and seek a further test at least 10 days after arrival in Ireland, in addition to the day 5 test. Day 5 tests can be booked in advance via an online portal, and Day 10 tests can be availed of at the HSE walk-in testing centres. An online portal for booking day 10 tests is currently in development by the HSE </p>  <p>  Additional messaging to incoming travellers, particularly from Britain, is being put in place to emphasise the home quarantine requirement and to encourage uptake of the 5-day post arrival test. There is continued collaboration between all relevant State stakeholders to maintain and further strengthen measures aimed at optimising compliance with the 14-day home quarantine requirement. </p>  <p>  Due to the risk posed by the transmission of the Delta variant, enhanced contact-tracing protocols are in place for all detected positive cases with a travel history from Great Britain. We continue to closely monitor for spread of Delta through the national programme of Whole Genome Sequencing with 42% of confirmed cases sequenced in week 20. All suspected cases of the Delta variant are managed as per enhanced public health investigation and control for Variants of Concern.   </p>  <p>  In addition, given the risks posed by the Delta variant, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination, the Government decided last week that a range of higher risk indoor activities, including organised events, service in bars and restaurants, group training, exercise and dance will not commence as planned on the 5th July, pending the implementation of a system to verify vaccination or immunity status.   </p></reply>

To deliver on this priority, the HSE is working to achieve the aims and objectives of &ldquo;Breastfeeding in a Healthy Ireland &ndash; HSE Action Plan 2016-2021&rdquo;. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of some actions, the HSE will extend the implementation of the Breastfeeding Action Plan into 2022 and continue to work on priority outstanding actions.</p>  <p>  In May of this year I announced significant investment towards implementing the HSE Breastfeeding Action Plan, with &euro;1.58 million of funding to provide an additional 23.5 lactation consultants across hospital and community settings.</p>  <p>  Implementation of Breastfeeding in a Healthy Ireland &ndash; HSE Action Plan includes initiatives in the following areas: </p>  <p>  - Improved governance and health service structures </p>  <p>  - Breastfeeding training and skills development </p>  <p>  - Health service policies and practices </p>  <p>  - Support at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum through social marketing, support and advocacy. </p>  <p>  The Maternity Strategy states that "in addition to practical supports which can be provided to mothers, such as support to continue breastfeeding on return to the workplace, a broader societal change is required in order to promote a more positive culture around breastfeeding. This should support women to feel confident about their choice to breastfeed". In essence, this means that all mothers should be supported to breastfeed at anytime and anywhere.</p>  <p>  The HSE is partnering with key stakeholders to develop the supports that mothers require at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum through social marketing, support and advocacy. The www.mychild.ie website provides pregnant and new mothers and families with a range of information and supports about infant feeding. An Ask Our Expert (AOE) on-line service, provided by International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants, is available to answer mothers&rsquo; questions and link them to supports in their local area. The webchat facility and HSE breastfeeding Facebook page is also available. These services provide supportive and practical expert information in a friendly, supportive and non-judgemental manner.  </p>  <p>  A new Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes in public health services is in final draft and is due for implementation across all health services in 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Women and Infants Health Programme, in collaboration with health promotion and improvement and public health services in the HSE, supports the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding using a model suitable for the promotion and support of breastfeeding in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland &ldquo;We're Breastfeeding Friendly&rdquo; programme aims to support business, community and public service settings to welcome breastfeeding mothers and families. </p>  <p>  Breastfeeding will continue to be a priority for the Department of Health, and the Department and HSE will continue working to achieve the aims and objectives of the HSE Breastfeeding Action Plan.</p></reply>

However, I am pleased to confirm that the NMCU have now successfully restored web-enabled services. Medical and GP visit card applications can once again be submitted online or alternatively by post to the NMCU.</p>  <p>  It is also recognised that the cyber-attack had an impact on the review process, PCRS therefore decided to extend eligibility for certain cohorts.  Following the onset of the cyber-attack any individual who had not engaged in the review process for medical/GP visit cards, which had an expiry date of 31st May 2021, has had their eligibility extended by 2 months.  In addition, individuals who would normally be brought into review in June for cards with an expiry date of 31st August have had their eligibility extended for an additional 2 months (until 31st Oct). This temporary measure has ensured continued eligibility for individuals, i.e. continued access to GP care and prescribed medication, during an unprecedented cyber-attack on the health service. </p>  <p>  As web-enabled services have now been restored, the normal eligibility review process has resumed for cohorts holding cards with an expiry date of September 30th or later. Individuals who may have queries about an application/eligibility status can also contact the NMCU helpline, which is fully operational on 1890 252 919 for further information and assistance.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p>  <p>  On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p>  <p>  Further details are available here: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform you that this week will see the vaccine rollout at participating pharmacies expanded to encompass an opt-in model for the vaccination of younger age groups. The amendment to the programme follows updated advice from the NIAC regarding the use of adenoviral vaccines (AstraZeneca and Janssen) in those aged under 50 years of age.</p>  <p>  Younger age-groups who do not wish to receive an adenoviral vaccine will be offered an mRNA vaccination in due course. The HSE will put in place consent mechanisms to ensure that anyone under 35 years of age who chooses to avail of an earlier vaccination is adequately informed of the extremely rare side-effects associated with the adenoviral vector vaccines. People in this age group will also be advised about the probable timing of the availability of mRNA vaccine for their age group when considering this accelerated option.</p>  <p>  The administration of the single dose Janssen vaccine to those aged 18-34 will begin the week commencing 5 July at participating pharmacies across the country. The rollout is being implemented by the HSE in conjunction with the Irish Pharmacy Union and will see more than 700 pharmacies participating nationwide. </p></reply>

Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p>  <p>  Further to this support, a commitment to introduce the model of care for infertility, which was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks, which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  </p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated, and the AHR legislation is commenced. Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing cell and gene therapies, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to take account of evidence of the benefits associated with each given medicine.</p>  <p>  A number of gene therapies approved by the EMA are currently at various stages of the pricing/reimbursement assessment process and will be assessed by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

For this reason, a number of higher risk indoor activities will not recommence as planned on 5 July, pending the implementation of a system to verify vaccination or immunity status. However, as an exception, weddings already planned will be allowed to proceed with the planned increase in the number of guests to 50 at the wedding reception with protective measures from 5 July. </p><p>Unfortunately, due to current uncertainties with regard to the Delta variant there is not yet an indication of the number of guests that will be permitted to attend a wedding in August. The epidemiological situation will be monitored on an ongoing basis and the level of restrictions will be kept under review by Government.</p><p>As we further ease public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and phased, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained.  </p><p>Significant and sustained progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.  </p></reply>

The programme is based on the principles of safety, effectiveness and fairness, with the objective of reducing severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 infection. </p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis. Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and includes guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The current Guidelines state: There are currently four COVID-19 vaccines authorised for use in Ireland. The vaccines are not interchangeable. For vaccines that have a two dose schedule, the same vaccine should be used for both doses. You can read the guidelines at:  www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf</p>  <p>  There is insufficient evidence to recommend a change from the authorised two-dose Vaxzevria&reg; schedule or to support giving a mRNA vaccine instead of a second dose of Vaxzevria&reg;. There is a need for further evidence on safety and effectiveness of mixed (heterologous) vaccine schedules. Further information is expected in the coming months which may warrant an update of these recommendations.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the scheme.</p>  <p>  The conditions covered are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Those who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p>  <p>  Tax relief is also available on the cost of medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%, and further information is available at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Last month was the highest month of the year so far with 411 licences issuing. It is not possible to say at this stage how many afforestation licences will issue in July. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, along with my colleague Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for forestry, I remain committed to issuing 4,500 forestry licences this year, which is an increase of 75% on 2020, albeit that last year was a low output year.  </p>  <p>  To the end June, 1,758 licences have already issued, with 105 licences issued last week. In accordance with the trend perceived, it is anticipated that the second half of the year will be higher than the first half for licences issued and that the 4,500 target will be met by year-end. The 4,500 licences issued will comprise of Afforestation, Forest Road and Felling licences. </p>  <p>  Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has been set up with the objective of reviewing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, as well as the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy. </p>  <p>  Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group  has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system. </p>  <p>  I believe that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will deliver on its objectives and I am hopeful that this will provide encouragement to farmers and landowners to go into forestry, or to realise the planting licences they have already received,  and to avail of the attractive premiums available under the Department&rsquo;s Schemes.  </p></reply>

All inspections are subject to internal and external audit to ensure consistency of approach and correct application of procedure. </p>  <p>  Measures to assist farmers during the inspection process are prescribed both in EU regulations and in the Farmers' Charter. These include the right to advance notice of an inspection (except in certain cases where giving advance notice would limit the effectiveness of the inspection), the right to be represented at the inspection, the right to comment on the inspection report or notice of findings on the day of inspection when counter-signing the inspection report, access to a Review System and Appeals Process as well as the Department's Customer Complaints Process. These processes are designed to give the farmer an opportunity to submit any relevant comments or information relevant to the inspection. </p>  <p>  If an applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of an eligibility inspection or disagree with the outcome of the inspection, they may, following receipt of the interim notification submit any additional information in writing to the local District Superintendent. The final inspection findings are then outlined in a final notification letter having taken into consideration any comments submitted by the applicant. The applicant may then seek a review of the decision to the District Inspector for their region. This process and the relevant contact details will be outlined in the final notification issued to the applicant.</p>  <p>  In the event that the applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of a review, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within three months of the date of review decision letter. </p>  <p>  If the applicant feels that their case has been dealt with unfairly by the Agriculture Appeals Office, they can raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman, 18 Lower Leeson St., Dublin 2.</p>  <p>  Separately, the farmer may use the Department&rsquo;s customer complaints procedure if s/he is unhappy with the service provided by the Department.  Full details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

The project will feed into the development of the next national agri-environment scheme.  REAP is designed to focus on key learning objectives for participants and their advisors. </p>  <p>  Any parcels selected for REAP may not be converted to forestry during the term of the contract. Nevertheless, it is important to note that REAP is not a whole-farm project and opportunities continue to exist for afforestation and for other Forestry Schemes on parcels which are not in REAP.</p>  <p>  Section 14 of the REAP terms and conditions advise that monitoring and evaluation of the project shall be carried out. Participants in REAP shall facilitate the monitoring and evaluation process as required by the Department, including any necessary site-visits by the Department or its agents or providing feedback on the project as requested. This feedback will then be used to inform future projects and schemes.  </p>  <p>  The Department actively promotes afforestation as a land use and the current Forestry Programme 2014-2020, which commenced in 2015 and has been extended to the end of 2022 recently, consists of 11 separate measures to encourage the planting of forests by land owners with a focus on afforestation of private lands. The Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 is 100% exchequer funded and represents State investment in the forestry sector of some &euro;482m over its lifetime.  </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s main Afforestation Scheme includes 12 different planting categories to promote a good species mix and covers 100% of the cost of establishing a forest. The scheme also pays an annual premium to the landowner of up to &euro;680 per hectare payable each year for 15 years. This approach has resulted in over 28,000 hectares of forestry having been planted on private lands during the course of the Programme so far. </p></reply>

Such a system would reduce the climate impact of biogenic methane to zero, balance remaining agricultural emissions by removals through land use, and also make a significant contribution to renewable energy. AgClimatise is the roadmap for Ireland that has been developed to deliver the 2030 climate ambition, as set out in the 2019 Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Assessing greenhouse gas emissions and removals from agriculture is dependent on a wide range of variables that differ from location to location and depending on particular circumstances. The average greenhouse gas emissions from a dairy farm in 2019 as detailed in the Teagasc 2019 Sustainability report was 507.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents based on a herd of 82 dairy cows. If the emissions for 82 cows are scaled on a pro rata basis per annum, this provides an emission figure of 619 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents for a herd of 100 dairy cows. </p>  <p>  Carbon sequestration by forests is influenced by a range of factors including species, soil type, site conditions and management practices. Teagasc have launched a new Forest Carbon Tool, which was developed with the support of the Department. This online tool calculates how much carbon can be removed by forests and highlights the important role of harvested wood products. Taking an example of the afforestation Grant and Premium Category 3 (i.e. 90% conifers and 10% broadleaves) on mineral soil, one hectare of forest has the potential to sequester a maximum of 357 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare at 26-years of age. </p>  <p>  Based on these assumptions, 45 hectares of afforestation (Grant and Premium Category 3) are required to deliver carbon neutrality for a typical dairy farm of 100 cows. It is important to note that once the forest is planted, it will not neutralise 26 years of emissions from the dairy farm until year 26, as the rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that afforestation can only remove a certain amount of carbon dioxide, which reaches equilibrium after a number of years, and additional forests would need to be planted to continue to remove and store the same levels of carbon dioxide into the future.</p></reply>

The Court&rsquo;s decisions, copied to the Department on 30th July 2018, did not support the Discloser's complaints. On 21st August, the Discloser withdrew a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission on the Department&rsquo;s handling of their protected disclosure relating to the 2016/2017 event. The Department&rsquo;s officials did not realise that the withdrawal was not in respect of the May 2018 disclosure.   </p>  <p>  To remedy this omission, the 2020 review recommended that the May 2018 disclosure be processed by an official not involved with the original review. The disclosure was then allocated to a senior official who had no prior involvement with the case. Having examined the disclosure, the official decided to engage the services of an independent external specialist who carried out an investigation. That investigation, which concluded in May 2021, found that there had been no wrongdoing as alleged in the May 2018 disclosure. The Discloser was informed of this outcome on 4th June 2021 and the  Department considers this matter to be concluded.</p></reply>

The post mortem result carried out at the factory of slaughter is final in this regard&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The Department does not accept scans as evidence of pregnancy since the post-mortem examination of reactors carried out in the factory is conducted by the TVI who is a qualified veterinary surgeon &ndash; this examination includes a visual examination of the uterus. This is the most accurate way to determine pregnancy status.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the pregnancy status of cattle may change between when the scan was carried out and when the animal was slaughtered and examined post-mortem.  As the Deputy might be aware, the rates of foetal loss can be high, particularly in early pregnancy.</p>  <p>  The TB compensation scheme is designed to ensure that all affected herdowners receive suitable compensation for each animal in question; the above method for determining pregnancy in a reactor animals ensures fairness to all herd-owners.  It is important that factors influencing the rate of compensation payable for TB reactors are based on objective evidence and the Department considers that the examination of the uterus post-mortem by a veterinary surgeon fulfils this requirement in this regard. </p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.  </p><p>A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels.</p><p>A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10<sup>th</sup>December last. </p><p>The High Court&rsquo;s ruling of Judicial Review proceedings which relate to the Policy Directive has been appealed by the State to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March last, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal on 22<sup>nd</sup>June.</p><p>Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June, the Court has decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within six miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. This decision applies until at least 4th October (the first day of the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s Michaelmas term) and/or until a determination in relation to the stay is delivered by the Court of Appeal. </p><p>The substantive hearing before the Court of Appeal was completed on 22<sup>nd</sup>June and judgement is reserved.</p><p>As this matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I am not in a position to comment until the matter can be resolved before the Courts.</p></reply>

Updates are published in our weekly Forestry Dashboard.</p><p>The target of issuing 4,500 forestry licences this year is an increase of 75% on 2020, albeit that last year was a very low output year.  June was the best month so far this year for licensing with 411 licences issuing then. </p><p>In terms of afforestation, the Department has issued more licences this year to end June compared to the same period last year, for a land area that is 20% greater in hectares.  Forestry road licences have already surpassed the target of 125km as indicated in the Climate Action Plan, 2019 at 149km of forest roads having been licensed this year.  </p><p>The figures from the last few months show a clear trend towards an increase in  licensing output which is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. As always there will be fluctuations between weeks but the end of year target remains. Revised efficiencies in the processing of licences, combined with additional resources, will strongly contribute to achieving this year's target. </p><p>In this regard, Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has, among other objectives, been set up to review and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system.</p><p>Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which has been brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  </p><p>It is important to note that no individual targets have been set for each type of licence. Based on the proportion of licences issued in 2020, we could surmise that approx. 65% of these will be tree felling licences, 20% will be for afforestation and the balance for forest roads. These figures, of course, must be treated as an estimate, based on experience from previous years, of how the total licence output could likely be distributed across the different licensing categories. </p><p>A comparison between numbers of licences issued in the years from 2016 to 2021 is presented in the following tables:</p><p><b>Number of Licences issued to 30</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>June each year:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2016 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Felling </td>       <td>1,105 </td>       <td>799 </td>       <td>3,220 </td>       <td>1,032 </td>       <td>974 </td>       <td>1,219 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afforestation</td>       <td>302 </td>       <td>279 </td>       <td>386 </td>       <td>531 </td>       <td>829 </td>       <td>807 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roads </td>       <td>355 </td>       <td>190 </td>       <td>345 </td>       <td>188 </td>       <td>226 </td>       <td>214 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Percentage change in output relative to 2021:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2016 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Felling </td>       <td>28% </td>       <td>-191% </td>       <td>7% </td>       <td>12% </td>       <td>-10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afforestation</td>       <td>8% </td>       <td>-28% </td>       <td>-76% </td>       <td>-175% </td>       <td>-167% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roads </td>       <td>47% </td>       <td>3% </td>       <td>47% </td>       <td>36% </td>       <td>40% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that Minister of State Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, and I are receiving regular updates on the steps being taken to produce more licenses each week.

A two-stage approach is being undertaken to deliver the commitment.</p>  <p>  On 28th April, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 which sets out the Regulations to give effect in Irish law to EU Directive No. 2019/633 on Unfair Trading Practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain.  These Regulations came into effect from 1st July 2021 for new supply agreements for agricultural and food products.</p>  <p>  One of the key principles of the UTP Directive is to protect farmers and other weaker suppliers of agricultural and food products against stronger buyers. These Regulations will help to provide that protection and are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural producers. The UTP Enforcement Authority required by the Directive will, pending the establishment of the new NFO or equivalent Office, operate in the Department and will have the necessary statutory powers to investigate complaints, carry out investigations on its own initiative and initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the UTPs prohibited under the Directive.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the new NFO or equivalent Office requires primary legislation. The new Office, whose remit will include the meat sector, when established will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland and will also incorporate the UTP Enforcement Authority functions.  In addition to establishing the new Office, the primary legislation may introduce rules that go beyond those included in the UTP Directive. It is important to be aware, however, that the Office will not be able to determine commodity prices.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the public consultation on the establishment of the new Office held by the  Department ended on 11th June. The consultation sought views on extending the rules of the UTP Regulations as well as on what other functions may be assigned to the new Office. The Department is currently examining the submissions and recently held an information seminar on 25th June for stakeholders at which an overview of the submissions received was provided stakeholders were also reminded of their obligations under the new Regulations. The next step is to finalise the primary legislation.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commitment is to establish the new Office to ensure fairness, equity, and transparency in the food chain and this must be delivered for suppliers of all agricultural and food products, including suppliers of meat products.  I am fully committed to ensuring that the new Office will bring as much transparency as possible to all sectors within the agricultural and food supply chain.  I will also ensure that the new Office has the appropriate statutory powers to enforce the legislation, when finalised, to ensure all suppliers will have assurance that there will be appropriate investigation of non-compliance with the requirements. </p>  <p>  The outcome of the current consultation will help to determine the principles and policies to be included in the new legislation and the powers to be assigned to the new Office, so it is not possible to state at this stage what the primary legislation will include.  However, I am satisfied with the new Office will provide a service that will help to enhance the position of all agricultural producers for all product sectors in the food supply chain, in a fair and equitable manner.</p></reply>

In 2018, the Commission published a proposal to amend the fisheries Control Regulation. The proposal has been examined by both the European Parliament and the Council Working Party. The Parliament adopted its negotiating position on the proposal in March.  Now that the Council has adopted its general approach on the proposal, trilateral negotiations between the Council, European Parliament and Commission will commence shortly. </p>  <p>  The general approach agreed by Council takes on board a number of Ireland's key concerns, including retaining the derogation allowing for weighing of catch away from the quayside under certain conditions, including the application of a rigorous control plan.  This derogation is an important issue for fishing processors in Ireland whose factories are located away from landing ports.  As the Deputy will be aware,  the Commission has revoked Ireland's current control plan and Ireland's control authority, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), is preparing a new revised control plan for submission to the Commission.  </p>  <p>  The Commission also presented its annual communication on the state of play of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and on fishing opportunities for 2022.  This is the preliminary step in the annual process of setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for the following year.  I made clear at Council that the disproportionate burden placed on Ireland in terms of quota loss under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement must be addressed and that renegotiation of quota shares will be a priority for Ireland in the upcoming review of the CFP.  </p>  <p>  Other items on the Fisheries agenda included an update from the Commission on the implementation of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive.  The Commission also provided information on European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) programming, focussing in particular on the added value of public investment in fisheries and aquaculture.  </p>  <p>  I also raised the issue of the recent unjustified, unilateral mackerel quota increases by Norway and the Faroes.  In May 2021, Norway increased its share of the mackerel stock by 55% for 2021.  The Faroes then mirrored this and increased its quota by 55%.  Iceland continues to set an unacceptably high share of the mackerel stock.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is the EU's largest shareholder in the mackerel stock and the actions by Norway, Iceland and the Faroes are a matter of great concern as they threaten the sustainability of the stock.</p>  <p>  I made clear to the Commissioner and fellow Fisheries Ministers that if these parties are unwilling to reverse their unilateral actions, then the EU must take strong action using all possible measures, including trade sanctions, to protect the sustainability of the mackerel stock and to protect the EU share of that stock.   </p></reply>

The Commission mandated EFSA in March 2019 to review the guidance and to consider new scientific evidence that has become available since 2013. The Department supported this scientific review and revision process and wishes to see effective guidance that can be fully implemented in as short a time frame as possible.</p>  <p>  An important part of the process is the definition of a specific protection goal for honeybees to be used in the updated guidance. During the discussion at the recent meeting, I indicated that Ireland agreed with the Commission that one specific protection goal for honeybees should be set for the whole of the EU. I also indicated that Ireland could agree with the Commission&rsquo;s proposal of a maximum allowable reduction of 10% in honeybee colony size as a consequence of exposure to a pesticide.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, which was shared by a majority of Member States, was based on scientific information presented by EFSA and the Commission during previous consultations with Member State experts and other stakeholders. The agreed protection goal is considered to be a highly protective science-based figure which can be reliably measured under realistic conditions in appropriately designed field studies.</p>  <p>  I also pointed out during the discussion that there is a pressing need to develop suitable protection goals for bumblebees and solitary bees as well, something that is currently lacking, in order to allow for full implementation of the updated guidance and comprehensive assessments of the risks of pesticide use to all relevant bee species.</p></reply>

The Department will continue to keep them updated as to the progress being made.

Additionally, preliminary steps were proposed at the meeting to establish links between Comhdh&aacute;il and participating departmental representatives to provide island communities with lines of communication to explore relevant island issues. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that a finalised draft of the policy will be ready for consideration by the end of the year.  I would also envisage further meetings with island bodies such as Comhdh&aacute;il in tandem with progressing the draft policy and they will be kept informed and consulted with through all stages of the process. </p></reply>

The first stage of the process is complete with an online survey now closed and the analysis is currently taking place of 665 completed responses received. Targeted focus groups will commence later this month and continue in September and it&rsquo;s expected that the consultants will provide a draft report with recommendations to my Department before the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  Local Authorities published their first Local Economic and Community Plans (LECP) in 2016/2017.

Two areas were selected to pilot the approach - one at Mount Gable in Connemara and the other in the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.  Comhairle na Tuaithe later established a Mountain Access Project Steering Group, which was tasked with reviewing progress on the pilots and examining issues around a National Indemnity Scheme for landowners.</p>  <p>  In June 2019, a new mandate was presented to Comhairle na Tuaithe which reinforces and strengthens its advisory role in relation to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland.  A Working Group was established to make recommendations on membership and working arrangements to ensure that Comhairle could deliver effectively on its renewed mandate. The Working Group proposed the establishment of a number of new subgroups, including one to replace the Mountain Access Project Steering Group, which had not been operational for some time.  </p>  <p>  The Sustainable Uplands Recreation Subgroup was established in May this year. It has been tasked with reviewing the Mountain Access Programme and facilitating its expansion. The group has met twice and has begun work on reviewing the existing Mountain Access Project Toolkit in order to support the expansion of the Programme to other areas. Through the work of this subgroup, I expect that Comhairle na Tuaithe will come forward with recommendations as to how the Mountain Access Programme can be expanded to other areas. </p></reply>

The CSP contribution does not meet the full salary cost of the supported positions, organisations are expected to provide additional funds from their own resources to meet the full cost of employment. Some 326 Managers and 1700 FTEs are currently being supported under CSP. </p>  <p>  In 2020, Indecon International Economic Consultants, on behalf of my Department, carried out an independent review of the CSP.  The Indecon report was published on 30th September last, following which my Department and Pobal commenced work on the restructuring of the programme in line with the Indecon recommendations. </p>  <p>  Work on the revision of the programme is ongoing and while the final format of the revised programme hasn&rsquo;t been fully determined as yet, it is expected that it will operate on the basis of targeted calls for applications to address particular needs or issues by area or by sector, depending on the identified need.  </p></reply>

The responses generally related to both matters as they are closely linked. </p>  <p>  The issues raised in the approximately 1,000 submissions to the public consultation are wide ranging, complex and require analysis, further consultation with stakeholders and an exploration of approaches in other jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  This process is nearing completion and I expect the findings of this review to be submitted to me shortly.</p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised regarding the overall approach to the regulation of restricted breeds.  There is also the view that some additional breeds, including the presa canario breed, may warrant inclusion on the list of restricted breeds.  My Department is considering these and other points as part of a review of the legislation in this area and is now identifying any necessary legislative amendments that may be required with a view to inclusion in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.</p></reply>

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans.  </p>  <p>  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 45 trails supported by approximately 2,040 landowners and is managed by 16 Local Development Companies (LDCs) around the country. At present, my Department funds Rural Recreation Officers (RROs) in 13 of these 16 LDCs. The RROs manage the Scheme at a local level. They work with landholders to ensure that the designated walks are maintained at an approved standard. RROs also make a significant contribution to the development of the outdoor recreation sector locally.</p>  <p>  My Department commissioned an external review of the Walks Scheme to examine the delivery and strategic development of the Scheme, and assess the role and resourcing of the RRO posts throughout the country.  The reviewers were also required to consider the level of funding provided to the Local Development Companies to deliver the scheme. I hope to be in a position to publish the review once the final version is received in the coming weeks and after the contents have been fully considered by my Department. The recommendations contained in the review will inform decisions on the further strategic expansion of the scheme, including the resourcing of Local Development Companies.  </p>  <p>  West Cork Development Partnership has two very significant trails funded under the Walks Scheme &ndash; the Beara Way and the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way. There are almost 580 landholders funded under these two walks receiving funding of about &euro;650,000. West Cork Development Partnership also receives funding for one full-time equivalent RRO position.</p>  <p>  I am aware that an issue has arisen with the delivery of the scheme in West Cork and officials from my Department formally met with West Cork Development  Partnership last Friday. I understand that the company outlined the challenges presented by the large number of participants on the Scheme in West Cork and the extensive area covered by the trails there. It is clear that the company has a significant workload relative to other areas and I believe that this is something that we can respond to as part of the implementation of the Review of the Walks Scheme. </p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all of the stakeholders, including West Cork Development Partnership, to ensure that the scheme can continue to function effectively.</p></reply>
