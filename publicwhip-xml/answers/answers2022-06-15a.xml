The credit of &euro;176.22 ex VAT, which suppliers began applying in April, will be applied to remaining domestic electricity accounts through May and June, and includes prepay meters.    The Scheme is one important part of the significant Government response to address energy poverty and protect vulnerable customers in the last Budget, subsequently and most recently in the National Energy Security Framework. </p>  <p>  The scheme is operated by ESB Networks and electricity suppliers with oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. To deliver such a widely applicable Scheme in a tight timeframe it uses a single eligibility criterion of a meter point registration number with the credit being applied automatically to all domestic electricity accounts held with suppliers on 29 March. </p>  <p>  The payment is being applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2), as set out in section 1 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to individual cases are a matter for the service provider.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Frequently Asked Questions, are available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/</p></reply>

In this regard, the Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. Eighty per cent of the actions are now been delivered, and work is continuing across several Government departments to deliver the remaining key reforms. In particular, reform to the Duty of Care legislation is expected to address issues of &ldquo;slips, trips and falls&rdquo; prevalent in high-footfall activities such as festivals and community events.</p>  <p>  One development has been the creation of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within my Department. The role of the Office, which I chaired, is twofold: to assist in reducing insurance costs, and increasing the availability of cover, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. The Office is currently working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market to improve its overall competitiveness and to offer cover in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; here. </p>  <p>  I regularly meet with community groups and representative bodies, in order to understand gaps in terms of the market. As this stakeholder engagement process carries on, I will continue to raise the issue of insurance market &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; and will restate my concerns in meetings with underwriters and brokers. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-15a.38.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061500066#WRB03700"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.</p><p>MOT is comprised of a carbon component and a non-carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account.</p><p>In response to the current fuel crisis, I introduced a significant reduction in the MOT rate applying to petrol from 10 March this year.  Inclusive of VAT, the reduction in the MOT rate amounts to 20 cents per litre. In addition to this rate change, I also brought forward legislation in Finance Act 2021 to provide for a temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT to MOT on petrol. This reduction came into effect on 1 April. I took this step to partially offset the expected rise in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. Both rate cuts will remain in place until 11 October this year.  MOT rates on petrol since Budget night last year are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Petrol rates/1,000L from</th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon </th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>ETD minimum</th>       <th>MOT &amp;gt; ETD minimum by</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13 October 2021</td>       <td>&euro;541.84</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;636.71</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;277.71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10 March 2022</td>       <td>&euro;379.24</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;474.11</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;115.11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 April 2022</td>       <td>&euro;371.11</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;465.98</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;106.98</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Regarding MOT on auto-diesel, I introduced a rate reduction of 15 cents inclusive of VAT from 10 March. A further reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT was applied from 1 April. MOT rates on auto-diesel from October 13 last year to date are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate. Current rates will remain in place until 11 October this year. <table>    <tr>       <th>Auto-diesel rates/1,000L from </th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon</th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>Effective MOT incl.

The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre/&euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. At current retail prices the repayment rate is at this maximum.</p><p>It is important to note that the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel must be considered in ensuring compliance with the ETD. The effective rate includes the maximum MOT rate repayable under the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), currently &euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. The current MOT rate on auto-diesel is &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, which is &euro;75.38 above the ETD minimum. However, when the DRS is taken into account, the effective MOT rate is &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres, or 0.038 cents per litre, above the ETD minimum, meaning that any material reduction in the effective MOT rate would be incompatible with EU law. </p></reply>

In recognition of these pressures, a number of support measures are already in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include various tax-exempted financial supports provided by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to assist parents to offset the costs of early learning and childcare and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 announced the introduction of a number of direct expenditure measures to support parents in respect of childcare costs, including:</p>  <p>  - From May 2022, hours spent in the Early Childhood Care and Education pre-school programme or school will no longer be deducted from a family's entitlement to subsidised hours of care under the National Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  - From May 2022, a Transition Fund for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare providers will require participating providers to ensure no increase on parental fees from the September 2021 levels. This will be replaced in September 2022 by a new Core Funding stream which requires participating providers to maintain their fee levels at or below September 2021 levels. </p>  <p>  - From September 2022, the universal subsidy of the National Childcare Scheme will be extended to children aged up to 15.</p>  <p>  These measures will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are felt by parents. </p>  <p>  With regard to taxation measures, and separate to the above: </p>  <p>  - The Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees. www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-01-11.pdf </p>  <p>  - Individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home may claim childcare services relief each year, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income. www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/childcare-services/index.aspx </p>  <p>  - A Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year. www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/single-person-child-carer-credit/index.aspx</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, I do not currently have any plans to introduce income tax relief on the cost of childcare along the lines he suggests.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I receive many requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer and I must have regard to budgetary constraints and the equitable treatment of all tax-payers. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Under this strategy, my Department is committed to review the options presented in the Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers (2017).  A copy of the 2017 report is available at: www.gov.ie/en/collection/51d1c-budget-2018/. I understand that the review is in hand and, in keeping with the &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; commitment, is expected to be completed by Q3 2022.  </p>  <p>  Proposals for new tax incentive measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These guidelines make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the property sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering State intervention.</p></reply>

This measure was initially extended in Budget 2022 to 31 August 2022 at a further estimated cost of &euro;251m. I have now extended this measure for a further six months. The 9% VAT rate will therefore remain for these sectors until 28 February 2023 at an additional estimated cost of &euro;250m. No further extension to this measure is envisaged so the 13.5% rate will apply to these sectors from 1 March 2023.</p>  <p>  This extension will cover the same goods and services as the original measure, restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, and hairdressing, as well as certain printed matter such as brochures, leaflets, programmes and catalogues.</p>  <p>  The further extension reflects the fact that the tourism and hospitality sectors were among those most impacted by the public health restrictions put in place throughout the pandemic.

This is a commercial matter for individual companies to assess on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with their own calculation of various factors, including risk. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from any such intervention. </p>  <p>  I am aware of recent increases in the cost of travel insurance. Furthermore, Government acknowledges the strong concerns felt by many groups regarding the cost and availability of such cover. While recognising that there is no single domestic legislative or policy fix to these and other insurance related issues, this Government has nonetheless moved to help address them through the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the Second Action Plan Implementation Report in March, which showed that 80% of the actions were being delivered. Our focus has now shifted towards delivering the remaining aspects of the Action Plan, most notably rebalancing the duty of care. Proposals for this important reform were approved by Cabinet last month. </p>  <p>  One part of the Insurance reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which I, as Minister of State for Financial Services,  chair. My officials have also been working with the IDA to leverage the achievements of the reform agenda with overseas insurers. The IDA has commenced a targeted and multi-phased engagement process with several insurance providers and work is underway on this initiative.in order to encourage new capacity enter the market.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all market segments.</p></reply>

When these issues have been resolved, the property will be prepared for disposal in line with the OPW&rsquo;s aforementioned policy on disposals.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW), like other State bodies, is obliged to follow central Government policies and protocols on the disposal of surplus properties.  The approach to managing vacant properties is firstly, to establish if the property is required for alternative State use, including the potential for it to be re-purposed either for Government Departments or for the wider public service.</p>  <p>   As a matter of policy, no property is disposed of until there is certainty that there is no alternative State use for that property.  The OPW, as a matter of course, consults with the Land Development Agency, Local Authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and other State bodies in advance of any decision on the future of a property.  </p>  <p>  In addition, a list of vacant properties and sites has been provided to the Departments managing the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Once it has been established that surplus properties are not suitable for alternative State use, the OPW then considers if open market disposal is a viable option.  Prior to disposing of a property, the OPW may re-evaluate the property&rsquo;s potential and decide whether there may be a benefit to retaining a strategic property or site for future use or development.  In this specific context, the OPW must take a long-term view on the potential future utility of such properties rather than seeking short-term commercial gain.</p>  <p>  Finally, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The OPW has recently entered into a Licence Agreement with Carrigtwohill Community Council for the development of a vacant site at Carrigtwohill as a temporary community garden, pending any alternative State requirement for the site.</p></reply>

At the time, an estimated 4&frac12; million  people had fled Ukraine, with the majority arriving in European Union Member States.</p>  <p>  This prudent provision is included to address the crisis while not impacting on the Core Expenditure amounts for delivery of public services and of the National Development Plan. Given the evolving nature of the situation, it is difficult to provide exact costings as the number of arrivals fluctuate on a daily basis. The demographic profile of arrivals, a key determinant of costings, is also subject to considerable change.  </p>  <p>  Initial estimates suggest costs in the region of a half billion per 10,000 refugees. These estimates were based on a number of assumptions including the use of emergency hotel accommodation for which there are significant capacity constraints. The cost per refugee is highly sensitive to the accommodation solution provided&mdash;accommodation solutions are currently being developed and may change over the medium term&mdash;this complicates providing an annual cost per refugee. </p>  <p>  The provision of &euro;3 billion in 2023 would allow for a cost of c.&euro;30,000 per refugee assuming c.100,000 refugees. This is in line with the international experience. Based on OECD analysis during the 2015 refugee crisis, significant amounts were spent by European countries: </p>  <p>  - Germany who received as many as 900,000 asylum seekers spent 0.5% of GDP; </p>  <p>  - Sweden which received 163,000 asylum seekers (1.6% of total population) spent 1.35% of GDP.</p>  <p>  Applying these percentages to 2023 forecasts of GNI* in Ireland would give a range of &euro;1.3 billion to &euro;3.5 billion. Given that c. 100,000 refugees would represent 2% of the Irish population, it is more likely that the costs would be towards the upper end of the range.</p>  <p>  This was supported by a bottom up assessment of likely expenditure in key areas, based on assumptions regarding accommodation solutions, demographics and social protection costs.  It is too early to estimate the time horizon for, and level at, which supports will be required. The &euro;3 billion contingency included for 2023 will be revised as more information becomes available. Costs will be monitored on an ongoing basis and estimates will be updated as appropriate, taking into account any revised assessments in relation to overall numbers of refugees.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p><p>The number of inspections undertaken in the period 2019 to Q1 2022 are set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Physical Inspections carried out</th>       <th>Virtual Inspections carried out</th>       <th>Total Inspections carried out</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>40,728</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>24,315</td>       <td>1,388</td>       <td>25,703</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>15,131</td>       <td>5,109</td>       <td>20,240</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Q1/2022</td>       <td>10,142</td>       <td>490</td>       <td>10,632</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Detailed information in relation to the number of inspections and enforcement actions undertaken in 2019 to 2021 is available on the Department's website at:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/da3fe-private-housing-market-statistics/</p><p>Pandemic restrictions greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The County and City Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections for long periods in 2020 and 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. Even when restrictions were relaxed there was still a reluctance on the part of some tenants to allow authorised inspectors access their homes. Inspections have been and continue to be frustrated by some tenants needing to self-isolate due to having Covid-19 or being a close contact.</p><p>In response some local authorities piloted virtual inspections which my Department supported with Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council led this initiative and commenced virtual inspections in May 2020. My Department incorporated and standardised the approach taken countrywide into a pilot programme, requesting business cases from participating local authorities to ensure that processes are suitably robust and comprehensive.</p><p>It is a key component of the virtual inspection model that local authorities reserve the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so and landlords were advised accordingly. Many rented dwellings have been subsequently re-inspected physically, since pandemic restrictions have eased.</p></reply>

These new homes will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, and Local Authorities, funded by the Affordable Housing Fund. The Land Development Agency will also deliver Cost Rental, either on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p><p>The CREL funds AHB development of Cost Rental homes through low-interest loans over 40 years for up to 30% of delivery costs. Two Calls for Proposals have issued to date, with the most recent approvals confirmed earlier this year.</p><p>Budget 2022 allocated &euro;70 million to the CREL scheme for Cost Rental delivery by AHBs in 2022. Over 900 homes have been approved for funding under the scheme to date, with a total of almost 4,000 CREL-funded homes being targeted for delivery over the 5 years to 2026.</p><p>The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open market prices. </p><p>The first 50 purpose-built Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Respond and Tuath AHBs in March 2022 at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Dublin. Again, these tenants benefit from rents which are approximately 40% below comparable market rents in the area for their two-bedroom apartments.</p><p>So far this year, 20 CREL-funded homes have been tenanted at Parklands in Citywest. The tenanting and allocation process is underway for a further 123 Cost Rental homes across 4 sites in Dublin and Kildare, which are due to be tenanted by the end of June. This will bring the number of Cost Rental homes in Ireland to 258, less than 12 months since the passing of the Affordable Housing Act last July, with 208 of these homes supported by CREL funding.</p><p>To date, approval in principle has been confirmed so far for approximately 900 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme in the period to 2023. The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to a number of these projects are being completed by the AHBs concerned. Full details of the projects, including specific locations, housing typologies and cost-covering rents cannot be made public until these arrangements are concluded. Details are set down in the tables below.

As such, and given the potential variations in the size of households, figures are not available for the precise number of people living in the 135 Cost Rental properties tenanted to date.</p></reply>

With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment. Then, intensive work continues on these issues once they are housed. Housing First has been a key element of Government homelessness policy.</p>  <p>  The Housing First approach to addressing homelessness places direct access to housing first and foremost for vulnerable individuals using homeless services consistently or intermittently over long periods of time, and those unable or resistant to accessing homeless services and who may then become habitual rough sleepers. These individuals often have complex high support needs such as mental or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnosis (the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction).</p>  <p>  Data on the number of Housing First tenancies created are published every three months as part of my Department's Homeless Quarterly Progress Reports. At the end of Quarter 1 2022, a total of 232 Housing First tenancies had been created over the previous year. While the exact sustainment rate of these particular tenancies is not known by my Department, the Housing First programme had an overall sustainment rate of 86.6% during the 2018-2021 Implementation Plan period.</p>  <p>  Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The new Plan outlines the targets for each region and in each year. In 2022, it is aimed to create a total of 282 Housing First tenancies. </p></reply>

The provisions of the scheme are detailed under Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021. The percentage difference between the market value of the home and the discounted purchase price is reflected in a redeemable equity stake held by the Local Authority of between a minimum of 5% and a maximum 40% of the value of the home.</p>  <p>  The income eligibility criteria for the Local Authority scheme are detailed in the Affordable Housing Regulations 2022 (S.I. No. 183/2022), which can be found online at:</p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/183/made/en/print.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of these Regulations, the general rule for eligibility is that an applicant's (or applicants' applying jointly) annual gross income multiplied by 3.5 times cannot exceed 85.5% of the market value of the home in question. This rule can be represented by the formula: 3.5 x A = 0.855 x B</p>  <p>  (Where A is the annual gross income of the applicant(s), and B is the market value of the home)</p>  <p>  This test looks at whether someone would have the capacity to meet a purchase price of more than 95% of market value through using a standard mortgage of 3.5 times income and for 90% of the purchase price (i.e. the maximum mortgage they could obtain without benefiting from one of the limited exemptions from the Central Bank Mortgage Measures).</p>  <p>  In the case of a new home with a market value of &euro;250,000, for example, this equation produces the result that the general eligibility limit is an annual gross income of &euro;61,071 (to the nearest euro). Altering the market value of the home will produce different income values accordingly.</p>  <p>  As detailed in the Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022, once eligibility has been established, affordable homes will be sold to purchasers at discounted prices set according to the purchasing capacity of each applicant household and the minimum level of support which they require. This is subject, however, to minimum prices set by Local Authorities to reflect economic realities and ensure scheme viability.</p></reply>

This initiative allows the LDA to supplement the development of housing on State lands it is already working on.</p>  <p>  Project Tosaigh Phase 1 was launched in November 2021 via an Expressions of Interest process and a large volume of proposals of varying feasibility were received from house builders.  The LDA is advancing work on a second phase of Project Tosaigh which will target more comprehensive partnerships with developers to deliver a stable flow of affordable homes over the five-year term of the initiative.</p>  <p>  The intention of Project Tosaigh is to collaborate with the development sector to unlock stalled development and achieve economies of scale, and not to compete against other publicly funded affordable housing schemes. Affordable housing delivery across the various delivery streams is considered and co-ordinated nationally at the High Level Affordable Housing Delivery Group, at which local authorities, the AHB sector and the LDA are represented. Affordable housing delivery across delivery streams is co-ordinated locally by housing authorities liaising with AHBs and the LDA, including in the preparation of Local Delivery Action Plans.</p></reply>

At this pre-application phase, applicants are advised to ensure they are aware of the validation, screening process, planning, environmental impact assessment, appropriate assessment rules, technical assessment requirements,  including public participation requirements and so on. The path which each application takes through the assessment process can vary depending on the nature and scale of the proposed activity or development.  </p>  <p>  The processing times for foreshore licenses may also vary from application to application depending on the nature of the works proposed, the complexity of the environmental reports to be considered and the nature of the engagement of the applicant with the process overall. Once a completed formal application has been validated by the Foreshore Section details will be published on our website at www.gov.ie/en/collection/f2196-foreshore-applications-and-determinations/. A public consultation will be arranged by the Department as part of the application process in due course.</p></reply>

The funding provided gives the households concerned an opportunity to obtain a piped supply of water for the first time replacing deficient private supplies in many cases.</p>  <p>  Among the benefits of the multi-annual funding approach is that it provides assurances to applicants that expenditure may be recouped over the course of the Programme as projects progress. Projects that have not commenced should progress to completion quickly but if necessary, as is the case here, may carry over into the next funding cycle.  </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for policy while the day to day management of the Programme is devolved to the local authorities. Each local authority has appointed a Rural Water Liaison Officer (RWLO). The RWLO deals with the day to day issues for the Programme and can be contacted at the local authority offices.</p>  <p>  However, to be helpful in this case my Department has contacted Irish Water and asked them to reply to Kerry County Council on the matter raised by the Council as quickly as possible. In addition my Department is liaising with the Council on the matter.</p>  <p>  Local authorities work in conjunction with communities to complete the process to deliver projects under the Programme as quickly as possible through engagement with all stakeholders including Irish Water as required. Project delivery face considerable challenges not least of which was the Covid-19 restrictions in the 2019-2021 funding cycle.

Due to the impact of Covid-19, Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over two years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. </p><p>As can be seen in the figures provided below, the number of staff assigned to processing FBR applications in 2020 was impacted by the suspension of the service and subsequent reassignment of staff to consular duties in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, a number of FBR staff were reassigned to passport duties as demand for passport applications increased. In 2022, staff continued to be reassigned to passport duties in response to the unprecedented increase in demand seen by the Passport Service in recent months. </p><p>My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p><p>A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen over 400 new staff members join the Passport Service since June 2021. The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. Over 70 officers have been assigned to the Passport Service from this competition in recent weeks. It is anticipated that some of these resources will be allocated to the provision of FBR Services as the current high level of passport demand reduces.</p><p>The information requested by Deputy Lowry is outlined below in tabular form.</p><p>In October 2021, the Passport Service established a temporary phone line to respond to Oireachtas Members' queries on urgent passport cases.</p><p>There are currently 10 staff assigned to the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service team, along with one team lead and one officer carrying out administrative tasks. </p><p>Since 23 May, up to 20 queries per week from each Oireachtas Member can be facilitated by this team.</p><p>Staff on the Oireachtas Line continue to work productively under increasing pressure. They are dealing with record numbers of calls and queries every week and have handled over 17,500 queries from Members since the beginning of this year.</p><p>In each case raised by an Oireachtas Member, the Passport Service reviews the application in question. However, applications can only be expedited in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. Such applications are expedited through the Travel Emergency service.</p><p>Non-urgent cases should continue to be dealt with through the existing phone lines and web chat facilities. Passport applications that are being processed in line with their turnaround times cannot be expedited. Where the estimated issue-by date has been exceeded this will result in a query being raised internally in the Passport Service. The Passport Service will work to issue a passport or respond to a request for further information to the customer within two working days.</p><p>While Deputies often hear of the most complex and pressing cases, the overwhelming majority of passport applicants have their passport processed without any recourse to their local TD. </p><p><b>Passport Service staff assigned to processing Foreign Birth Registration applications</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of FBR staff</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>73</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These applications include:</p><p>- All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity</p><p>- First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form</p><p>- First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)</p><p>Child renewal applications can be witnessed by members of a wide range of professions including school teachers and secretaries, doctors and elected representatives. It is important that these witnesses are available to confirm their witnessing of consent forms when called by the Passport Service. </p><p>The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.</p><p>In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.</p><p>It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.</p><p>It is the experience of the Passport Service that the current process of witness verification is generally an efficient and effective one. </p><p>Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with senior management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified after three attempts. </p><p>Details on these applications are now forwarded by the Passport Service to Garda HQ on a daily basis. The Garda Liaison Officer will then undertake to verify the details and revert to the Passport Service within 24 hours.</p><p>This new system, which commenced last week, will assist in reducing the number of passport applications that are delayed due to a failure to make contact with AGS to verify witness details.</p><p>The Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.</p><p>The Passport Service has published a full-page informational advertisement in the June edition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that the details must be recorded in the Garda log book and that the Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent and identity form details.</p><p>In addition, the Passport Service has released a helpful video guide to correctly completing the witnessed identity and consent form for children. This is available on my Department's website at www.dfa.ie/passports/consent-for-children/ </p><p>The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p><p>The Passport Service continues to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p></reply>

Passport applications from all citizens - whether from anywhere in Ireland, North or South, or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.</p><p>Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online which is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. 87% of applicants from Northern Ireland are submitted online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p><p>A paper-based, mail-in service is available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.</p><p>In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 4-day turnaround.  The Dublin office also offers a 1 day turnaround which is possible due to the production capacity in that location. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 7,600 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 1% of the total 720,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.</p><p>Given the high percentage of applicants from Northern Ireland using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. Furthermore, recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p><p>The information requested by Deputy Brady is outlined below in tabular form.

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of FBR staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The application referenced was registered on 18 May 2020 and is due to be processed in the near future.</p>  <p>  FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

This process was followed in relation to the nomination of the Ambassador-designate to the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  In considering the nomination of Ambassadors, a range of factors is taken into account including political, economic and trade priorities.  In addition, management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge, policy experience, consular experience, and other factors are considered as part of the assignment process. Foreign language skills, where relevant, are also considered. In considering the nomination of Ireland&rsquo;s next Ambassador to the United Kingdom, having served in senior civil service roles with vast experience working across Government at the highest levels, including working with international partners and the peace process in Northern Ireland, the nominee was considered particularly suitable.  The nomination was approved by Government at its meeting on 27 July 2021.</p>  <p>  Assigned Ambassadors, and all other officers taking up diplomatic posts overseas, undertake a significant programme of pre-posting training to complement their existing skills and experience and to prepare them for their assignments in Ireland&rsquo;s missions overseas.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process</p>  <p>  The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.</p>  <p>  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  Primary and post-primary schools make provision for pupils&rsquo; special educational needs (SEN) through a continuum of interventions ranging from additional support teaching in mainstream schools to placement in a special class or, in some cases, enrolment in a special school.  Schools are provided with the resources, through the special education teacher allocation model, to assist them in meeting the needs of their students, including those with language difficulties.  Schools are required to target their additional resources at those students requiring the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Specialist provision for children with SSLD is available at primary level.  This is based on the principle of early intervention.  There are sixty-three special classes for pupils with SSLD attached to mainstream primary schools in dispersed geographical locations. These classes cater for pupils with a very specific set of language needs by enrolling them for a maximum of two years. The classes are designed to provide a time-limited, targeted intervention for children with severe impairments in their skills of understanding and expressing themselves through spoken language. The special classes focus on a relatively narrow cohort of pupils whose language difficulty is not otherwise attributable to co-morbid factors such as general learning disability, deafness or behavioural challenges. Pupils who attend special classes for children with SSLD return to mainstream provision following the two year intervention and they can avail of further support from the school&rsquo;s special education teacher.</p></reply>

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements to support schools run a summer programme. It is accepted that a school-based programme provides a more holistic experience for the students and helps retain the important connection with school and peers.</p><p>It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. </p><p>Under the home-based summer programme the allocation is 10 hours per week for 4 weeks where a student&rsquo;s school is not participating in a school-based programme. The allocation is done on a per household basis with adjusted allocations for siblings. </p><p>Allocations of time for siblings broadly reflect how children may be grouped if they were in the same class at school. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six students with complex needs in schools.</p><p>However to meet the specific needs of different siblings with special needs in the home, an increased shared allocation is provided for siblings as set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of siblings participating in home-based programme</th>       <th>Number of hours allocated per week to be shared between participating siblings</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Two </td>       <td>15 hours per week shared for four weeks (60 hours shared total)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Three </td>       <td>20 hours per week shared for four weeks (80 hours shared total)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Four </td>       <td>25 hours per week shared for four weeks (100 hours shared total)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Five </td>       <td>30 hours per week shared for four weeks (120 hours shared total)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Six </td>       <td>35 hours per week shared for four weeks (140 hours shared total)</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The scheme is responsive as it allows for circumstances where additional hours can be provided, as outlined below, when children have differing levels of need, school setting or residence .</p><p>Separate allocations of 10 hours per week will be provided to a child where that child is:</p><p>- Attending school at a different educational level to their sibling &ndash; (i.e. one child is primary and the other is post-primary)</p><p>- One child is in a specialised setting (i.e. one child in a special class or a special school and the other child in mainstream)</p><p>- Where two eligible children are each in a specialised setting (i.e. a special class or a special school)</p><p>- Or where one sibling is living in a separate home. </p><p>The siblings referred to by the Deputy do not meet the criteria as set out above for a separate allocation. However, if there is further supporting information in relation to any of the above criteria please provide this information to the Department for consideration at: homebasedsummerprogram@education.gov.ie.  </p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process</p>  <p>  The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past four months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p>  <p>  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  The focus of my Department is to fund the provision of suitable temporary accommodation.

The package of measures announced in Budget 2022, particularly the Transition Fund and Core Funding, are designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are felt without being absorbed in fee increases. </p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations contained in the Expert Group report, '<i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare'</i>, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding in 2022. This will be developed further in future years.</p><p>From August 2020 to April 2022, ELC and SAC services could access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover required by other employers. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.</p><p>Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 94% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. </p><p>Following the Transition Fund, Core Funding will become available from September 2022 and will be worth up to &euro;221 million in a full year. A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. </p><p>NCS provides income-assess and universal subsidies in respect of ELC and SAC.  Income-assessed subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means-tested and calculated based on individual circumstances. Rates will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family.</p><p>Parents who do not qualify for an income-assessed subsidy may qualify for a universal subsidy. The universal subsidy is currently available to all families with children under 3 years old and families with children over 3 who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50 cents per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.</p><p>Two significant number developments to the Scheme were announced as part of Budget 2022. </p><p>The first development, which came into effect on 2 May, has removed the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.</p><p>The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under the age of 15 from September 2022 &ndash; benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p><p>Both of these changes will result in more families receiving additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare.</p><p>Additionally, participation in NCS is a requirement for services to come into contract for Core Funding (unless they are a sessional pre school service only).</p><p>Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents and I hope to build on these in future. </p><p>As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.</p></reply>

Core Funding is a new funding stream designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and ELC and SAC providers for the public good. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. 2022 will see up to &euro;73m being made available for Core Funding, which equates to &euro;221m in full year costs. </p>  <p>   Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS subsidies and ECCE capitation, as well as AIM funding for those services that participate in that model, in addition to parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding makes a contribution to staff costs, which comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. In this respect, Core Funding includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million) and for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million). Employer costs are factored in to the staff costs allocation in Core Funding. A further &euro;38 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. </p>  <p>  Core Funding also makes a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This includes an increase since the original allocation was announced in the budget.</p>  <p>  Extensive analysis of the income and costs of providers demonstrates that the combined funding model of ECCE, NCS and Core Funding offers a substantial and attractive package to providers to cover costs, including increased costs related to quality measures, while also committing to the key conditions of Core Funding such as the fee freeze.</p>  <p>  On the matter of capacity, the availability of high-quality ELC and SAC is a key Government priority. </p>  <p>   To ensure that the supply of ELC and SAC places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p>  <p>   Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas. </p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for ELC and SAC. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. My Department has continued to monitor capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and on responding to the unmet needs of families. In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in ELC and SAC services. This was followed in May by the Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal annually on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  Capacity data captured through the recent CCC survey and the Early Years Sector Profile Survey has been extracted and will be made available in the coming weeks. An initial analysis of these data shows the national vacancy rate at 13.3%. </p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, City/County Childcare Committees have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 is the primary policy vehicle to achieve this vision. The Strategy pursues objectives under four thematic pillars providing a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible and included, treated equally, healthy, and feel safe and supported. </p>  <p>  Action 21 of the Inclusion Strategy aims to ensure that Ireland has robust legislation and supports in place to combat hate crime, and encourages people to report it.

The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past four months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 34,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has a significant role, as part of the State's overall response, to support children and families displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis, with its child protection responsibilities, and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children.</p>  <p>  Children under the age of eighteen who are outside their country of origin, who may be in need of international protection and are separated from their parents or their legal/customary care giver are considered as Separated Children seeking International Protection (SCSIP).</p>  <p>  SCSIP who arrive at ports of ports of entry to Ireland are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are received into the care of Tusla. </p>  <p>  In circumstances, as raised by the Deputy, whereby parents of the children fleeing the war, have made arrangements for their care with families in Ireland prior to their arrival are not in the care of the State. Nevertheless, such arrangements between the parents and the Irish hosts are noted by Tusla upon arrival of the child in Ireland. A follow up visit to the new home of the children is typically arranged. The children will be welcomed into their new temporary community and are typically provided with schooling and other services as part of the whole of Government response to the war in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Officials from both my Department and the Department of Social Protection (DSP) have had discussions to ensure that a joined up approach is being taken to supporting these cases. Efforts so far include gathering information on the available financial supports with a view to disseminating that information across relevant service networks within the Departments and to relevant organisations that work alongside the Departments. </p>  <p>  In these circumstances a number of financial supports may be available through Departments including DSP to the hosts in recognition of their efforts to assist the separated Ukrainian family and in particular the children. The hosts may also be able to avail of the Government&rsquo;s scheme which recognises those who have pledged accommodation to those Ukrainians fleeing the war in their home country. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme is intended to provide a flat fee of &euro;400 per month to those providing accommodation to Ukrainians .</p></reply>

The Office will have responsibility for all aspects of the management, oversight and development of the apprenticeship system and for implementing the Action Plan. Under the Action Plan the NAO will exercise on a shared and conjoint basis the relevant legislative and funding functions of SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority (HEA).</p>  <p>  The new National Apprenticeship Office will deliver additional practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeship. Dr Mary-Liz Trant, who has extensive senior experience in education and training, has been appointed as the first Director of the Office.</p>  <p>  The NAO Director is currently providing the leadership required to address the next stage of the NAO&rsquo;s development, including finalising a work programme for 2022, staffing allocations and the development and implementation of solid governance and financial arrangements, aligned with the Action Plan, in consultation with SOLAS, the HEA, my Department and other key partners. A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated in Budget 2022 for the first year of the NAO&rsquo;s operation.</p></reply>

This number grew to 779 apprentices i.e. almost 3% of the apprentice population at that time when commercial and non-commercial semi-state organisations are included. A breakdown of the number of apprentices employed across the public sector at the end of 2021 is attached.</p><p>A key commitment of the <i>&lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo; </i>is to grow the number of apprenticeship registrations across the public service, including local authorities, to reach 750 annual registrations by 2025. This represents in excess of a seven-fold increase on 2020 registrations and will support a long-term goal of 7% of the apprentice population being employed by public service employers.</p><p>Whilst it is not yet determined where the apprenticeship roles are best located, the diversity of the public service provides a wide basis for involvement with the range of existing apprenticeships and those programmes in development. Apprenticeship provides an opportunity to target and widen the recruitment pool for both generalist and specialist roles within the public service.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s officials have undertaken a number of actions in order to make progress towards achieving this commitment:</p><p>- Several general and sector-focused information sessions on apprenticeship were held late last year.</p><p>- A Working Group has been established, representing Government Departments and agencies and local authorities, to develop a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan by summer 2022. The Group&rsquo;s work is based on surveying over 100 organisations in relation to their skills needs.</p><p>- There is also engagement with the HSE and Department of Health in relation to a commitment in the Action Plan to explore a healthcare assistant apprenticeship programme for the HSE and the options for how this might be piloted.  </p><p>The results of the survey of public service organisations have now been analysed and a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, informed by the survey results, is being drafted. It is intended to submit the draft for Cabinet approval before the summer recess. <table>    <tr>       <th>Public Sector Apprentices employed at end of 2021</th>       <th>number of apprentices </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Civil service </td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Authoriies </td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Defence Forces </td>       <td>176</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>commercial semi-state organisations </td>       <td>513</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>non-commercial semi-state organisations </td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>779</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, from September 2021 the postgraduate fee contribution grant increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500, and the fee grant income threshold increased from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240. This income threshold will again increase for the 2022/23 post graduate cohort to &euro;55,240.</p><p>Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are also eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;6,115 and qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p><p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees payable to the institution in the case of postgraduate student fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria. </p><p>An estimated cost of the State fully supporting all such fees is therefore not available as the rate of fee for postgraduate studies differs by institution and course.</p><p>However, for the 2021/22 academic year, 2559 post graduate students received a tuition grant of &euro;3,500 and if this were to be increased up to the maximum post graduate fee contribution of &euro;6,270, the cost would be approximately &euro;7.1m. This estimate does not include the cost of any new students to the scheme that may apply if the grant amount increased.</p></reply>

In recent months we have seen vicious crimes take place. These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p><p>We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our laws and values should reflect this. I will shortly, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill which will legislate against hate crime and hate speech and ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all.</p><p>The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.</p><p>The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender.</p><p>Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p><p>Separately, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.  </p><p>The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions.</p><p>Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a number of specific operations in Dublin City aimed at addressing anti-social activity.  The operations involve increased uniform and plain clothes proactive patrolling of the city, with a particular emphasis on the city centre.</p><p>Operation Citizen, established in November 2021, is a co-ordinated approach involving Garda&iacute; from both Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central and North Central with an emphasis on providing high-visibility policing in the city centre to provide reassurance to the public and proactively tackle incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p><p>I am further informed that, as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to hate crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provides assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded hate crimes / incidents on PULSE and social media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.</p><p>A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of Hate Crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) and the HSE act as the channels of funding for these services. Of the above amount, KWETB administers in the region of &euro;573,860 to four frontline drug and alcohol projects. </p><p>Employees of drug and alcohol projects are in the majority of cases employed and contracted by voluntary drug and alcohol services and are subject to the relevant employment legislation/regulations in force. The Department of Health has no role in relation to the pay and conditions and job security of the employees of projects funded through KWETB or the HSE.</p><p>It might be helpful to clarify the situation in relation to pay restoration for section 39 agencies, funded by the HSE. Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide.  </p><p>It should be noted that staff in section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive the cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements.  </p><p>In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p><p>It must be acknowledged that Section 39 organisations are voluntary bodies and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. Consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Department of Health or the Minister of Health to comment on terms and conditions of employment within the voluntary sector. </p><p>Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. It is confirmed that there is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that from a Departmental point of view, the process has reached a final resolution. </p><p>I appreciate the financial challenges facing community-based drug and alcohol services. To increase access to and the provision of such services, I have established the community services enhancement fund, with an allocation of &euro;2 million, which will be distributed through the HSE community healthcare organisations using a population-based resource allocation model, in conjunction with drug and alcohol task forces. </p></reply>

On 24th February, the ESRI published a report entitled, Home Support Services in Ireland: Exchequer and Distributional Impacts of Funding Options, examining the anticipated demand for home support due to a statutory scheme and the projected cost of home-support in a range of funding scenarios. </p>  <p>  Further information is available here - www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/SUSTAT111.pdf</p>  <p>  With regard to your question on the HSE tender for the provision of services, this is an operational issue and has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to you.</p></reply>

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Currently there are 2,551 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS scheme. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. As of the 1st of May 2022, there are no GMS vacancies in the areas concerned.  </p><p>Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, the person concerned having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area) can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign a GMS patient to a GP's GMS patient list.</p><p>The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p><p>The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reform and service development will see the Government increase annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. These changes and others make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice.</p><p>The number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. Responsibility for training has transferred last year from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners and an intake of 258 trainees is planned for this year, with further increases expected for future years.</p><p>These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year.

While the primary aim of this group is to set out a roadmap for the development of a high-performing genetics and genomics medical service, it provides an unprecedented opportunity to connect genomics healthcare services with the research and innovation community. Innovation in genomics is occurring across the globe and Ireland has a lot of international examples to draw from as we plot our path ahead. The FinnGen Project is one of these examples. It proves the valuable insights that can be gained from combining genome information with digital health care data. It is for this reason, we have sought input from international experts to inform our own Strategy.</p>  <p>  Excellent research can only be achieved so long as the patient whose genomic data is being investigated is being protected and they are the forefront of the benefit of this work. We must continue to foster confidence by ensuring that patients and the public are giving full and clear consent. There are three other key developments underway that will help to shape and realise a way forward for Ireland.</p>  <p>  1. The IPPOSI Citizens&rsquo; Jury on Future Use of  Genomics, which began its deliberations earlier this month, will examine such areas as how genomic information can improve our health as individuals and as a society, to what extent we should support the  increased use of genomics in our health care and health research, the challenges and opportunities that arise from doing so, and the safeguards that are needed to maximise progress while containing  the risks. Its work is guided by an independent Oversight Panel, which  includes public and patient representatives, the Health Research Board,  clinicians, researchers, geneticists and regulatory experts. Genetic and genomic information belongs to people, and those people should have a say in how this information should be used in Ireland for health care and health research.</p>  <p>  2. The current Health Research Board Strategy explicitly identifies the advancement of genomics research as a priority objective. Earlier this year, the HRB played a lead role in securing Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a Digital Europe project to design, develop and  implement a federated Genomics Data Infrastructure across Europe with the  aim of ensuring that countries have the necessary data infrastructure in place to collect, store, manage, share, and analyse genomic datasets within and across EU Member states, in a secure, transparent and trusted manner. The project will allow authorised data users, such as clinicians and approved researchers, to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and precision medicine. This project, which is co-funded by the HRB brings researchers, clinicians, patient representatives, clinical geneticists,  data analysts and others together to develop a roadmap for such a data  infrastructure in Ireland, with work on a roadmap beginning in earnest later this year. </p>  <p>  3. Another key element for advancing genomics is access to biobanking infrastructure and support services. Fuelled by the COVID crisis, my Department made funding available for the first time to establish and maintain a national biobanking infrastructure to advance covid-19 research and innovation. This initiative, led by the Health Research Board, involves universities and hospitals across the country working  together towards a common ambition, with an emphasis on international best practice, strong regulation and governance, and underpinned by principles of transparency and accessibility.</p></reply>

The HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework is applied to the management of individual incidents and is the mechanism for incident investigations in the HSE. The HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework is designed to provide health and social care services with a practical and proportionate approach to the management of incidents. The focus of the Framework is on understanding how and why an incident occurred and using this knowledge to improve safety. The HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework places emphasis on the need, in the aftermath of an incident, to adopt an empathetic, person centred and practical response to persons affected by an incident. </p>  <p>  In relation to HIQA, it was established as an independent statutory authority under the Health Act 2007 to promote safety and quality in the provision of health and social care services for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public.

Since its establishment in 2007, HIQA has regulated and monitored certain health and social care services across Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s role in monitoring healthcare services is directed by its legislative remit, national standards and evidence of what interventions reduce risks for patients and promote safe, effective and quality care. Engagement with interested parties, international research, guidelines and best practice all help to inform HIQA&rsquo;s monitoring programmes.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007, Section 8(1) (c) confers the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) with statutory responsibility for monitoring the quality and safety of healthcare services. </p>  <p>  HIQA has been engaging with the UL Hospitals Group since July 2020 in relation to overcrowding in the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  HIQA believed that an investigation of the overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick would be inappropriate while the hospital was challenged with the management of COVID-19 related activity.  HIQA sought further information and assurances from the hospital group relating to their evaluation of the factors influencing the continued overcrowding in the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department.</p>  <p>  Having flagged their intention to include Limerick as an early inspection once their new programme of monitoring commenced, HIQA conducted a risk-based unannounced inspection of the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick on 15th March 2022. The report of that inspection is due for publication on Friday 17th of June, 2022.</p>  <p>  University Hospital Limerick has experienced a substantial increase in attendances in recent months and recorded a 10% increase in attendances in the first quarter of this year, as compared to the same timeframe in 2019. </p>  <p>  I visited UHL in February and met staff, patients and management, and subsequently requested the HSE CEO to appoint an expert team to review ED operations at the hospital.  The Review Team reviewed the day-to-day functioning of UHL within a leadership, management, operational and clinical context to consider how improvements in UHL may be enabled in the short term. Critically, it sought to identify what is required locally, regionally and nationally to support operational and clinical effectiveness on a sustained basis across UHL. Key drivers of the Review Process were the delivery of safe effective care for the population served by UHL and the close, integrated and patient centred collaboration with Community Operations in CHO Midwest.  </p>  <p>  Separately the hospital management has commissioned an external review (Deloitte) to review and advise on unscheduled care and patient flow in the hospital and the HSE review team will also consider the outputs of this work in its review. I am awaiting the findings of the HSE review team.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the sustained increase in ED attendance in 2022, and have also has met with the Chair, CEO, and senior management in the HSE and requested the development of comprehensive plans for each ED which will set out short term and long-term measures to be taken locally and nationally, including at each Community Healthcare Organisation, to ensure sustainable improvements in ED performance. I and my department are working closely with the HSE on developing the plans which will be published in due course.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs on 19th April, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision.

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November 2021 in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to a legal challenge in the Courts. </p><p>In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I as Minister must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of the policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation.  </p><p>There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. </p><p>Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA. </p><p>Earlier this year, I asked the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) to examine measures to strengthen the management arrangements for the 2022 Mackerel hook and line fishery, within the policy, for my consideration.A working group involving industry representatives recommended by the QMAC and the Department was put in place and made recommendations for the management of the 2022 Fishery which were supported by the QMAC and which I have approved.The management arrangements are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The fishery is now open, and the implementation of these arrangements will I hope assist in extending the length of this fishery this year.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value adding in the project.  </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit, while also building more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. The scheme is aimed at supporting industry led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material and at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets. The scheme will be proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  The scheme received State Aid clearance on the basis that it provides supports to SMEs only.  This is consistent with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines which require consistency with the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation, which in turn restricts grant aid to the processing sector to SMEs only.</p></reply>

A &euro;15m fund was recently announced so that groups can apply for funding to make improvements to their facilities.  Details of how to apply are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  There are a number of groups in society who can face additional barriers to equal participation in community and civic life, the LGBTI+ community being one of those groups.  Since 2019, my Department has provided funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund to support LGBTI+ community organisations across the country.  The 2022 Dormant Accounts Action Plan was announced last November and included &euro;200,000 for supporting LGBTI+ community organisations. The main purpose of this funding is to help the organisations make the existing community infrastructures inclusive and welcoming to the LGBTI+ community and to provide pop-up LGBTI+ services in areas not currently serviced.  </p>  <p>  Following an application process, the funding is allocated to Local Authorities who engage with LGBTI+ organisations at local level to agree actions and ensure that they are implemented.  I understand that some organisations have included actions to set up pop-up facilities to provide information relevant to the LGBTI+ community. I do not currently have the detailed information requested, however my Department will forward this information to the Deputy within the coming days.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, community and voluntary organisations.  Two organisations with a direct focus on LGBTQI+ supports are being funded under the new iteration of the SSNO, Belong to Youth Services and LGBT Support and Advocacy Network Ireland.  In addition, there are other organisations funded under the SSNO programme, while not having a specific focus on LGBTQI+ supports, may provide related supports and advocacy.</p></reply>
