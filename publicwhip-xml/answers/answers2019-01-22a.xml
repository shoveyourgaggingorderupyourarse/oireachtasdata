This includes changes in the operation of contracted training where ETBs engage the services of third party providers to deliver some of their education and training provision.  These services were formerly contracted by Training Centres under the remit of F&Aacute;S. </p>  <p>  A review of the contracted training model was undertaken by SOLAS in 2016 which included a number of recommendations to ensure contracted training was flexible, innovative and responsive. Following this review, the Office of Government Procurement on behalf of the ETBs invited expressions of interest from suitably qualified service providers for the provision of contracted training services for which it was proposed to establish multi supplier frameworks. This competition was completed in January 2018. Each ETB is a contracting authority in respect of the services it engages.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that a detailed analysis on the value and quality of the provision will be undertaken once a full year's data is available. SOLAS have at this stage engaged with the ETBs in collating information in relation to contracted training in order to compare with previous years. </p></reply>

Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats on the basis of an agreed selection process. </p><p>The terms of the scheme (which are regularly communicated) make it clear that places for ineligible children are not guaranteed for the duration of a child's education. </p><p>Under the terms of the scheme, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for ineligible children.

These courses seek to develop skills for the economy, to facilitate greater participation in society and to promote personal development.</p>  <p>  This Government has a major focus on upskilling and reskilling the working age population.  During the recession the focus was mainly on supporting unemployed people back into employment but the approach is now much broader, encompassing those already in employment and those not currently participating in the labour market.  This is supported by an expanded and reformed National Training Fund.   This year, ETBs are being allocated an additional &euro;11million in funding for the new Skills to Advance policy, which delivers upskilling and reskilling to those in employment with lower skill levels.</p>  <p>  ETB courses complement broader upskilling programmes and initiatives, such as Skillnets and Springboard, that play a crucial role in meeting the future skills needs of the economy. ETBs also participate strongly in the nine Regional Skills Fora, enabling them to deliver tailored solutions for employers and groups of employers and give enhanced employment opportunities to learners and upskill the regional workforce.</p>  <p>  ETB programmes, alongside employment programmes delivered by DEASP, aim to assist unemployed people into work.  ETBs and the Intreo offices work closely together at local level to develop and schedule FET provision to match the requirements of unemployed people. This collaboration is supported by protocols covering course provision, the referral of learners to programmes and a formal schedule of engagements between the agencies.  </p></reply>

The Plan targets 31,000 learner registrations on apprenticeship programmes over its lifetime. This represents a more than doubling of activity over the plan period.  </p>  <p>  This growth will be achieved through expanding employer engagement with existing craft apprenticeships and by expanding the apprenticeship model into new areas. Following two calls for proposals issued by the Apprenticeship Council, nineteen new consortia led apprenticeship programmes have been developed. These new programmes span a variety of sectors ranging from financial services and ICT to hospitality. Further new apprenticeships are due to get underway in 2019 in various sectors including construction, engineering and agriculture. </p>  <p>  This expansion of the apprenticeship system has led to a welcome increase in female participation. Year on year we are seeing greater numbers of women choosing an apprenticeship for their career path. Many of our new apprenticeships are in occupations that have greater gender balance in the workplace such as hospitality and accountancy.  At the end of 2018 there were 341 female apprentices registered, more than double the 2017 figure of 151. </p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2018 with 5,058 new registrations by year end, ahead of target and an increase 12% on 2017.</p></reply>

This benefitted circa 1,000 postgraduate students who met the eligibility criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant for the 2017/18 academic year and reversed the previous budgetary cut. </p>  <p>  In addition, postgraduate students who qualify for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.  </p>  <p>  Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2018/19 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund through the Access Office in the third level institution attended.  An additional &euro;1m was added to the Fund in 2017 which is specifically ring-fenced for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only.  A further allocation of &euro;1m for the Fund was recently announced. This additional funding will be aimed at students studying a Professional Master of Education programme in the 2018/19 academic year and who are experiencing financial difficulty.  A total of &euro;10.1m has now been allocated through the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) in 2018/2019.</p>  <p>  Tax relief is also available for postgraduate tuition fees. Details in relation to same are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Given that this expenditure is demand-driven and non-discretionary, it was therefore necessary to seek supplementary estimates to provide for retirements and pension costs over and above what would be supported by the original allocation, having regard to offsetting savings which arose in other expenditure areas.</p><p>This is an issue which has affected other Votes, as highlighted in last year's Spending Review on pensions expenditure in the Defence Forces.  </p><p>My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have worked closely to resolve this issue in order to better align the expenditure allocation with the expected pensions and retirements bill.  In Budget 2019, the Government allocated an additional &euro;147 million in funding for pensions in the education sector, in addition to &euro;12.5 million to cover the pensions-related costs of the Public Service Stability Agreement. This was calculated on the basis of actuarial work undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform using data provided by my Department.</p><p>  Unlike in previous years, where the supplementary estimates did not increase the expenditure base, this additional &euro;147 million will be added to the base and will bring the pensions allocation in my Department to around &euro;1.35 billion in 2019. This compares to a pre-supplementary allocation of c. &euro;1.19 billion in 2018.  This should mitigate the need for a supplementary estimate for pensions expenditure in 2019.  </p></reply>

The wide range of opportunities offered through the apprenticeship system should be an important part of this process.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy to give more choice to learners and to deliver key skills to employers.  Government is working to  promote apprenticeship as a programme of choice and have put significant additional resources into this area.  A national promotional campaign, Generation Apprenticeship, has been underway since May 2017, led by the Apprenticeship Council and SOLAS.  </p>  <p>  In addition, an independent review of career guidance, which is being carried out by Indecon International Consultants, is examining the quality and range of information and resources available to students in schools and other settings.  This will include an examination of how apprenticeship opportunities are presented to students. </p>  <p>  In addition, work is also underway on a new portal to increase the visibility of apprenticeship opportunities.  The portal will allow approved employers to advertise apprenticeships and to match with prospective apprentices. The new portal is expected to be rolled out in 2019 on completion of a pilot phase.</p></reply>

While I, along with my cabinet colleagues, continue to closely watch developments in the UK, my Department continues work to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit.  This work, at national and EU level, continues to intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. </p>  <p>  Central to all planning scenarios, the maintenance of rights and privileges under the Common Travel Area (CTA) will protect much of the valuable and rich cooperation which takes place between education on a North-South and an East West basis.  My officials have engaged with colleagues in the Department for Education in the UK on a set of principles which are designed to maintain and build on this cooperation. I am working closely with my Cabinet colleague, An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to conclude this process.  It is important to note that, notwithstanding the type of Brexit, the CTA will be in place.  </p>  <p>  Naturally, I do not wish for a Disorderly Brexit, but prudently, I am preparing for this.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Government Contingency Action Plan, an amendment to the Student Support Act 2011 has now been included as one of the parts of the proposed &ldquo;Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill.  This will facilitate the continued payment of SUSI grants to Irish students attending UK and Northern Irish higher education institutions and to UK and Northern Irish students studying in Irish higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  As well as that amendment, I also recently announced that EU fees would continue to apply to UK students and Northern Irish for the 2019/ 2020 academic year.  This brings certainty to UK and Northern Irish students who can be assured that the EU fees will apply for the duration of their studies in Ireland.  However, equally important, both of these actions will ensure that Irish school leavers seeking to pursue their higher education in the UK and Northern Ireland will have certainty as they are making their CAO/ UCAS choices at this time.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor all Brexit developments very carefully and I can assure all stakeholders in the education that the contingency planning is being constantly refined to substantially reduce risks arising from Brexit.</p></reply>

The Stage 2(b) submission for the project has been reviewed by my Department and comments have issued to the school and its Design Team. </p>  <p>  The Design Team has been requested to carry out one final review of all of its tender documentation for both the Main Contract and Reserved Specialists to ensure compliance with the Department&rsquo;s requirements and submit written confirmation from each Design Team member that they have completed this review and are satisfied that the Tender Documents are complete, correct and in compliance with Department and Building Control (Amendment) Regulations tender documentation requirements. These confirmations are currently awaited.</p>  <p>  In order to expedite this project, my Department authorised the pre-qualification of contractors in April 2018. The pre-qualification of contractors for the main and reserved specialist contract involves the compiling of a shortlist of contractors to ensure that there are a number of appropriate and suitable candidates who can undertake the works successfully. The Design Team completed the pre-qualification process in December 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department understands from the school and its Design Team that they are currently engaged with Fingal County Council in relation to a portion of land outside the school site, the use of which will minimise disruption to the school during construction. When this process has been concluded, the Design Team will be in a position to submit the requested Stage 2(b) confirmations and this project will then be progressed to tender. A tender stage normally takes between 7 and 8 months to complete.</p>  <p>  Upon completion of tender stage the project will then be progressed to construction stage. A 24 month construction period is currently envisaged for this project.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to getting the project delivered as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school. In such circumstances, children are eligible for school transport where they are attending the nearest special class that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the NCSE through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENO).</p>  <p>  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs in an area. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced on the 3rd of December 2018, provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  In circumstances, where the NCSE confirm that there is no school placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Departments Home Tuition grant scheme will provide funding towards the provision of 20 hours tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the demand for group arrangements by parents of children in receipt of the Home Tuition grant, the scheme provides Parents the option to enter into a group arrangement with other parents of children for whom home tuition has been sanctioned.  Parents wishing to enter into such an arrangement must notify my Department in advance for approval. The arrangements must conform to the general terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy is that all children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday.</p>  <p>  Prior to enrolling in school children may participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme. The current entitlement is to a maximum of two years of ECCE. </p>  <p>  The upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months for completing the ECCE programme was set in consultation with the Early Years Education Policy Unit in DCYA and is consistent with the policy of my Department.</p>  <p>  Current DCYA policy requires that any request for an overage exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria must be supported by a letter from a HSE/Medical Specialist (not a GP/Public Health Nurse) specifically recommending an extra year of pre-school for the child. This requirement relates to a need to maintain a clear and standard basis for applying for exemptions.</p>  <p>  Overage exemption applications are also considered with regard to the original purpose of ECCE which is to provide a pre-school programme in the two years before a child starts school. </p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that queries in relation to the operation of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme should be addressed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. </p>  <p>  Therefore, in response to your specific query I can advise that, in the first instance, parents should discuss their concerns in relation to their child or young adult with the Principal of the school involved with a view to discussing his/her response to interventions in place and the appropriateness of involvement of the NEPs psychologist for individual input including assessment. </p>  <p>  However the Deputy will be aware that access to a range of specialist and therapeutic services for children with developmental issues fall within the ambit of HSE services and therefore her question, depending on the specifics,  might more properly fall to my colleague the Minister for Health for response. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 139 are primary ASD classes and 41 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website </p><p>My Department will continue to support the NCSE in opening ASD special classes in areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Special Classes can be established within a schools existing accommodation. In such circumstances the school can apply to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools. </p><p>All school capital projects that have been approved by my Department under the Additional Accommodation Scheme, including special needs accommodation, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie and this is updated regularly.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.</p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more  extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p></reply>

Significant changes in relation to the modernisation of the mechanics industry has been taken into consideration in this review.  It is expected that the new version will incorporate additional material, including specific components on electric vehicles and safety. </p>  <p>  In respect of mechanics already working in the industry, it is the responsibility of employers to maintain a healthy and safe workplace under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.  In addition, manufacturers engage with dealers in the industry in relation to providing training for mechanics working on their vehicles.

The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  </p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it is not intended to extend the DEIS Programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

This has seen a significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Primary and Post Primary Infrastructure allocation amounting to &euro;672m will be expended primarily on the delivery of large scale projects and on the Additional Accommodation Scheme. Typically, expenditure levels of between 70% and 80% of the capital allocation available to schools annually is in respect of large scale projects and the Additional Accommodation Scheme. The balance available in 2019 will be expended on site acquisitions, the Summer Works Scheme, the Emergency Works Scheme, furniture and equipment provision and other smaller programmes. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process, including schools at primary and post primary level in County Kildare. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement in April 2018 regarding the establishment of 42 new schools, including new primary schools in Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas and a new post primary school in Enfield to meet demand in the Kilcock school planning area, over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p></reply>

It is also very encouraging to see a rise in the percentage of students in DEIS schools taking English and Mathematics at Higher Level.</p><p>This research provides further valuable evidence that the DEIS programme is working.  These improvements would not be possible without the commitment and dedication shown by the principals and teachers in these schools.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the study also supports the rationale for providing additional supports to those schools with the highest concentrations of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>However, it is still apparent that a gap still remains between DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  The aim of DEIS Plan 2017 is to continue to work towards narrowing this gap and it contains 108 actions regarding the implementation of the Plan.Work has commenced on the implementation of these actions in  with a focus on targeting extra resources as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need. </p><p>For the first time key targets have been set in specific areas such as literacy and numeracy, retention rates and progression.  All DEIS schools receive a suite of supports with those with the highest levels of disadvantage benefiting from lower class size.  DEIS schools receive financial resources in the form of a DEIS grant as well as an enhanced book grant.  They also have access to literacy and numeracy supports, priority access to professional development and the Centre for School Leadership, enhanced guidance allocation, access to Incredible Years and Friends Programme, access to School Meals Programme and Home School Community Liaison Scheme and School Completion Programme.  </p><p>Another example of an action we are taking to narrow the gap is the School Excellence Fund-DEIS.  This enables schools to apply for funding to implement innovative programmes which are context-specific and aimed at improving learning outcomes.  Full details on DEIS Plan 2017 can be found at: </p><p>The implementation of the various actions, to further improve the educational outcomes of those attending DEIS Schools, will continue during 2019.</p></reply>

Primary schools are given an annual allocation, currently amounting to &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil attending a special school or special class, under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Summer Works Scheme provides capital grants for small scale improvement works at primary and post-primary schools during the summer holidays. A total of 307 schools were recently approved in excess of &euro;40m to carry out improvement works during summer 2019. A new Summer Works Scheme will open for applications in Q1 2019 for projects to be delivered from summer 2020 onwards. </p>  <p>  My Department also sets-aside a contingency sum each year to deal with emergency works in primary and post-primary schools, including health and safety works.

These actions are also illegal, deeply unjust, and provocative.</p>  <p>  With the political process as such essentially frozen, Ireland has for some years focussed its efforts on the Middle East issues, both in the region and at international level, on trying to combat or mitigate these destructive and inhumane policies. We have discussed these aspects here in the Oireachtas on many occasions.</p>  <p>  Locally, in the region, Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. I have done so myself on my visits to the area. During my visit in July 2017 Ireland joined a number of other international partners in the West Bank Protection Consortium, a grouping where we seek to work together to protect Palestinian communities. Irish and other EU representatives have visited threatened communities and attended legal hearings related to their cases.  Ireland also funds Israeli and Palestinian NGOs engaged in defending these communities.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the European Union has taken a number of actions relating to settlements. These include the levying of higher tariffs on goods from settlements compared with goods from within Israel's recognised borders, prohibiting the use of EU research funding in institutions located in settlements, and rules to prevent misleading labelling of goods from settlements as being from Israel. Ireland has been to the fore in securing many of these actions.</p>  <p>  At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council last year, Ireland raised the continued expansion of settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. I reiterated our concerns about these policies in my speech to the UN General Assembly in September.</p>  <p>  These actions by Ireland and others have had some effects in halting, delaying or mitigating some actions, but we are all aware that the pressure on Palestinian communities continues and is growing. I again call upon the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities, and will continue to work to that end.</p></reply>

This is a priority for the Government given its importance for Irish exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the single market, in particular with regard to agri-food products. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  To this end, I welcome the EU's agreement that the UK may join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU, and the number of formal steps taken to allow this to happen on 4 December 2018. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge.</p>  <p>  Retaining the effective use of the landbridge post-Brexit has been discussed at both political and official level with both the UK and the EU. As a result of these contacts, the importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.</p></reply>

As part of these contacts, I met with Chief Negotiator Barnier yesterday while attending the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels.  Minister Humphreys will meet with Commissioner Vestager in Dublin on 24 January 2019 to discuss Brexit preparations. Other Ministers are in regular contact with Commissioners with responsibility for their sectoral areas.</p>  <p>  In addition to close bilateral contact at Commissioner level, Ireland has engaged regularly at official level with the Commission on preparedness for Brexit. This included a meeting between senior officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Commission Preparedness Group on 30 November 2018, to discuss issues of particular concern and impact for Ireland. Further engagement at a senior level will take place in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  As part of the planning and work at EU level a series of expert preparedness meetings involving officials from all Member States and the Commission have been underway since November and are currently ongoing. These seminars have covered a wide range of topics, including financial services, transport, data, fisheries, and citizen's rights.  A full list of the topics covered in the expert seminars is included in the Government's Contingency Action Plan published on 19 December 2018.</p>  <p>  Many of the actions aimed at mitigating the effects of a no deal outcome will be taken at the EU level as they involve areas of EU competence and sectors regulated by EU law.  The EU has already published over 80 sectoral notices with detailed guidance across a range of sectors and are a source of advice for operators, businesses and regulators.</p>  <p>  On 13 November 2018, the Commission published a Contingency Action Plan - Preparing for the UK withdrawal from the EU on 30 March 2019, which highlights key issues in the areas of citizens, financial services, air transport, road transport, customs, SPS requirements, personal data and EU climate policy. The Commission emphasises that it stands ready to engage with the Member States that will be most affected by a no deal withdrawal and expressly states that "the Commission will support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses."</p>  <p>  In its communication on 19 December 2018, the Commission adopted a package of contingency measures preparing for a possible no deal Brexit.  The package consists of a Communication "Implementing the Commission's Contingency Action Plan", five legislative proposals, four delegated acts, four implementing acts and one Commission Decision.</p>  <p>  Much of the contingency work taking place at the EU level is in the context of efforts to make regulatory provision for the gaps that would inevitably result from a no deal Brexit and to ensure that there is minimal disruption for EU citizens and industry. In a no-deal scenario, the Commission envisages a limited number of time-limited contingency measures to mitigate significant disruptions in a number of defined areas.</p></reply>

We discussed the disappointing but not unexpected outcome of the 15 January vote in the House of Commons on the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.

The loans attaching to the site were fully repaid at par value by the borrower in late December 2018 and NAMA accordingly was obliged to release its legal charge over the site.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that NAMA does not own or control property; rather NAMA owns loans for which the properties act as security.  If a property owner repays the value of their loan, as occurred in this case, then NAMA no longer holds any security over the owner&rsquo;s property. Thereafter, it is entirely a matter for the owner, in conjunction with the planning authorities, to determine how the property should be utilised.</p>  <p>  Even in cases where the property owner has not repaid the value of their loan, NAMA cannot force a borrower to take action which would reduce his or her repayment capacity, such as providing a property for social or public housing where that is not the financially optimal course of actions for the borrower. To do so would compromise a borrower's capacity to repay his or her debts to NAMA and would constitute a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  NAMA was established as an independent commercial body and I do not have a role in its operations or decisions, or in relation to the properties securing its loans. In that respect, neither I nor any official from my Department met with the former receiver of the Players Wills site in order to discuss any matter related to the property.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that, in accordance with S851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 Revenue does not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The position in tax law is that where an employer provides free access to medical services to employees or provides refunds to employees in relation to medical services paid for by the employees, the employees are subject to tax on the services or refunds received. However, Revenue does not seek to apply benefit-in-kind where employees have free access to a general practitioner employed or retained by their employer. In addition, one medical check-up per year, and check-ups that are mandatory for work purposes, may also be provided. These exceptions are set out in published Revenue guidelines, and they apply as appropriate to all employers.</p>  <p>  Where free access to medical services is provided to retired employees by their former employer, these services are not taxable. If retired employees are reimbursed by their former employer for medical services, the amounts reimbursed are taxable.</p>  <p>  The relevant tax legislation applies to all employers equally and there are no exceptions to the rules for particular employers, employees or retired employees.  The way any company provides services to its employees or retired employees is entirely a matter for that company to agree with their employees and retired employees. </p></reply>

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging and promoting competition and innovation, and the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities that support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs. </p><p>The SBCI does not lend directly. Rather, the SBCI operates through its partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers; the SBCI currently has three bank and three non-bank on-lenders: AIB; Bank of Ireland; Ulster Bank; Finance Ireland; Bibby Financial Services Ireland and FEXCO Asset Finance. </p><p>The SBCI aims to ensure on-lenders and financial intermediaries maximise the benefit and the service provided to Irish SMEs as well as protecting taxpayer money and the investment of both State and European institutions.  I am advised that the SBCI is keen to work with any lender, large or small, that can demonstrate it can deliver the required funding advantage to eligible SMEs on terms that protect taxpayer money. </p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland commenced its activities in March 2015. To the end of March 2018, the total amount of SBCI supported lending activity, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee Schemes, was &euro;972 million to 24,002 Irish SMEs supporting 129,300 jobs. The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from all sectors of the Irish economy and have a wide geographical spread, with approximately 85% of loans going to small businesses based outside of Dublin.</p><p>The SBCI is currently seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage thereby serving to meet the needs of Irish SMEs and encourage and promote competition in the SME finance market. The SBCI continues to work on developing new innovative products, such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, which was launched in March 2018. This &euro;300 million scheme is to provide working capital support to SMEs to enable them to adapt and innovate in response to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>Following on from launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme, a Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed to provide long-term investment financing for Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment. There is an absence of financing available for businesses in excess of seven years and the Future Growth Loan Scheme is intended to provide finance of eight to ten years for investment in process and organisational innovation, and investment in tangible and intangible assets on agricultural holdings linked to primary agricultural production. The SBCI recently launched an open call for participating finance providers to offer this Scheme through, which is expected to launch once successful lending partners have been appointed.</p><p><b>Chronological Table of SBCI Funds and Guarantees Committed to On-Lenders</b><table><tr><th>Date</th><th>On Lender</th><th>Liquidity (Funds)</th><th>Risk Sharing (Guarantees Provided)</th></tr><tr><td>December 2014 </td><td>Bank of Ireland </td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>February 2015 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank </td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>October 2015 </td><td>Finance Ireland </td><td>&euro;51m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2015 </td><td>Merrion Fleet </td><td>&euro;25m* </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2015 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank </td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December 2015 </td><td>Ulster Bank </td><td>&euro;75m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May 2016 </td><td>First Citizen Agri Finance </td><td>&euro;40m** </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June 2016 </td><td>Bibby Financial Services Ireland </td><td>&euro;45m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2016 </td><td>Fexco Asset Finance </td><td>&euro;70m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>January 2017 </td><td>Bank of Ireland </td><td></td><td>&euro;65m </td></tr><tr><td>January 2017 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank </td><td></td><td>&euro;60m </td></tr><tr><td>January 2017 </td><td>Ulster Bank </td><td></td><td>&euro;25m </td></tr><tr><td>March 2018 </td><td>Bank of Ireland </td><td></td><td>&euro;128m </td></tr><tr><td>March 2018 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank </td><td></td><td>&euro;122m </td></tr><tr><td>March 2018 </td><td>Ulster Bank </td><td></td><td>&euro;50m </td></tr><tr><td>May 2018 </td><td>Bibby Financial Services Ireland </td><td>&euro;25m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;531m</td><td>&euro;450m</td></tr></table>*Facility closed in July 2017 following the sale of Merrion Fleet to Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</p><p>**Facility closed in October 2018 following the raising of commercial funding by First Citizen Agri Finance.</p><p>The SBCI&rsquo;s lending to SMEs is largely driven by market demands and needs that are not fully met by the private sector. The Deputy can rest assured that the SBCI is working to develop a more diverse range of on-lenders and innovative products. This will enable it to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage, meet the evolving requirements of the SME finance market and contribute to a sustainable and competitive economy in the medium to long term.</p></reply>

Such guarantees constitute a contingent liability on the State&rsquo;s balance sheet, as the Deputy knows.</p>  <p>  As the fourth anniversary of the SBCI incorporation has now passed, it is timely and opportune to engage an independent external consultant to undertake a review of the SBCI and its activities as part of developing its future strategy. It is also important from the perspective of prudent and sustainable management of public finances and best practice for such reviews to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  To complete this process, the NTMA issued a public Request for Tender on etenders.gov.ie on 8 January 2019 for those services with a deadline for receipt of tenders of 25 February 2019. I am advised that it is anticipated that a contract will be awarded in March 2019 and the review is expected to be completed within approximately 8-10 weeks. </p>  <p>  The SBCI is a valuable policy instrument for supporting Irish small businesses which are vital to sustainable economic growth and development and employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

The new guidance withdraws the concessionary application of the zero rate to certain food supplements, and outlines that these products will be liable at the standard rate from 1 March 2019. Products, including folic acid and vitamin products, licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA), will continue to be liable at the zero rate. </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted. Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  Traders are not required to separately identify the yield generated from a particular activity or product type on their VAT return. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the yield from an increase of the VAT rate for the food supplement products affected, but it is expected that the additional yield will not be substantial. For the same reason, it is not possible to identify the number of products impacted. </p></reply>

This credit was introduced in 1991 specifically to assist such parents in the transition from married to widowed status.  The estimated cost of maintaining the relief at &euro;3,600 for five years is of the order of &euro;1.7m. This is based on 2016 data and assumes the number of claims for this credit will remain static at 2016 levels. It also does not take account of future economic growth, or the resulting change in income levels, which would have an effect on the taxable income and as a result the ability of taxpayers to fully absorb the credit.</p>  <p>  In relation to the estimated cost of extending the relief to ten years, at the current tapering rate of &euro;450 per year there would only be 3 additional years before the credit is reduced to zero (&euro;1350 in year 6, &euro;900 in year 7, &euro;450 in year 8). The cost of extending the relief to include the 3 additional years is estimated to be of the order of &euro;5m which would be fully materialised after a period of 3 years, again assuming the number of claims for this credit will remain static at 2016 levels and it also does not take account of future economic growth, or the resulting change in income levels, which would have an effect on the taxable income and as a result the ability of taxpayers to fully absorb the credit.</p>  <p>  However, both during and after this five-year period a widowed person with dependent children is also entitled to claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC), in addition to the single personal credit. This ensures that their basic personal credits, before taking into account the additional widowed parent credit, will be equivalent to those granted to a married couple while he or she continues to have dependent children. </p>  <p>  Widowed parents who qualify for the SPCCC are also entitled to an increased standard rate band of &euro;39,300. This compares favourably with the single person&rsquo;s tax band of &euro;35,300 currently. This ensures that in 2019 a widowed parent will not be subject to the higher rate of income tax until their taxable income exceeds &euro;39,300.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, widowed persons without dependent children, who therefore do not qualify for the SPCCC or the widowed parent credit, are entitled to the widowed person tax credit of &euro;540 per year in addition to the normal tax credits for a single person.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that widowed persons who are in receipt of the social welfare non-contributory widow&rsquo;s pension are not liable to the Universal Social Charge on that payment. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the significant provisions currently in place relating to the tax treatment of widows and widowed parents are targeting limited resources to where they are most needed. </p></reply>

Revenue have undertaken and continue to undertake significant preparations to facilitate this post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  During 2018, Revenue chaired an Inter-Departmental group which was established to consider the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure and facilities, post-Brexit. The group included representatives from Revenue; the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM); the Department of Health; the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Service (EHS); the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTS); the OPW; the Department of Justice; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the group considered the requirements for both the &lsquo;Central Case&rsquo; and the &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenarios and the physical infrastructure requirements to facilitate and support the movement of legitimate trade; including requirements of Revenue; DAFM; and the HSE&rsquo;s EHS; to carry out any necessary Customs interventions and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks at ports and airports.  The group identified that infrastructure was required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport and agreed proposals on the nature and scale of new or extended facilities that would be required. </p>  <p>  In relation to Rosslare Europort, the group identified the infrastructural requirements including service delivery and accommodation requirements. Following a Government Decision in September 2018, the OPW were tasked with leading the engagement with relevant stakeholders, with a view to ensuring that the necessary additional infrastructure for both the central case and the no-deal scenarios becomes operational in a timely manner. This work is ongoing and it is planned to have temporary facilities in place to cater for a no-deal scenario in March 2019 as well as permanent facilities in place by 1 January 2021. </p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. Neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. </p><p>In preparing a response to this PQ, my officials sought an update from the  Central Bank of Ireland on Alpha Insurance. The Central  Bank  has advised me that it was notified by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (&quot;DFSA&quot;) on 7 March 2018 that the latter had ordered Alpha Insurance A/S (&ldquo;Alpha&rdquo;) to cease writing new business including renewal of existing contracts and business with immediate effect. It was further notified on 9 May 2018 that the liquidators of the insurance company Alpha had filed a petition for bankruptcy.</p><p>The Central Bank has also indicated that as Alpha is a Danish-based insurance firm, it is subject to prudential supervision by the DFSA, and therefore it had no role in this decision. It has also informed me that Alpha was selling non-life insurance policies in Ireland through the broker network on a freedom of services basis and that it also operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The insolvency administrator has provided updated figures to the Central Bank as of December 2018 on the latent defects policies. Present figures stand at 1,617 policies, 1,163 of which are currently with the homeowner (these policies were transferred from the developer to the homeowner following completion of the build).  The remaining 454 policies were on houses that were not finished and therefore the policy had not transferred to a homeowner at the time of the liquidation i.e. the policy remained with the developer.</p><p>The claims handler (BCR Legal Group Limited) confirmed that its representative CRL wrote to the developers who had purchased these latent defects policies, on two occasions, to advise that Alpha had been placed in bankruptcy, that polices would be cancelled from 11 August 2018 and to request details of the owner of the properties insured under these policies. BCR subsequently wrote to all homeowners affected by the liquidation of Alpha, following receipt of their details from the developers, to advise that Alpha had gone into liquidation, their latent defects policies had been terminated and that they should consider replacing this policy. BCR also provided these homeowners with an information sheet from the liquidators. BCR can be contacted at policyupdates@bcr.co.uk.</p><p>It should be noted that the Danish liquidator of Alpha continues to provide country-specific updates of the latent defects policies on . The Central Bank of Ireland has also published information in relation to Alpha, which it will update if further information becomes available.</p><p>In conclusion,  I acknowledge that this is an unfortunate position that these householders have found themselves in however as Minister for Finance I am not in a position to facilitate the arranging of new insurance cover. </p></reply>

The Union Customs Code (UCC) which came into force on 1 May 2016 is the legal framework for Customs and this sets out the customs procedures across the EU. Revenue participate in regular meetings with their MS counterparts to ensure a common interpretation of customs matters in line with the UCC and a consistent approach to its implementation. </p>  <p>  The UCC provides for certain simplifications, procedures and authorisations that can further facilitate trade. The Authorised Economic Operation (AEO) is one such authorisation. I am advised by Revenue that recognition of authorisations post-Brexit, including AEO status, will be a matter for the UK and the EU and mutual recognition of the AEO status will form part of the future trading relationship negotiations between them. There has been no decision to date in relation to mutual recognition of AEO status in a no-deal scenario. </p>  <p>  Revenue have clarified that it is not necessary to avail of any of the specific trade facilitation measures allowable under the UCC such as AEO status in order to trade with a non-EU country.

This is a straight forward process and can be applied for online via the Revenue website. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-22a.282.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012200062#WRF01300"><p>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the recent guidance note on 'Transfers of Banking Business under Part III of the Central Bank Act 1971' published by my Department does not in any way change the requirements in relation to seeking the approval of the Minister for Finance as set out in the Central Bank Act 1971 (as amended). Rather this guidance note is intended to bring clarity to this process for any Irish authorised bank considering seeking my approval as Minister to transfer their business to another authorised institution. In particular the note seeks to highlight the timelines involved in the process, and to encourage any bank considering transferring its business to engage with my Department at an early stage. </p>  <p>  My officials must undertake an analysis of the proposed transfer and prepare a submission to me. This analysis may necessitate follow up with the bank in question, including queries on the transfer, and my officials may request written information notes, telephone calls or face-to-face meetings.</p>  <p>  I must also consult with the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland on any proposed transfer of banking business, so as to be fully informed of the relevant regulatory, supervisory and prudential considerations, and sufficient time must be allocated to allow me to do this.</p>  <p>  The Statutory Instrument pertaining to the transfer of business must be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and again sufficient time should be allocated.     </p>  <p>  The statute sets out a deadline that, &ldquo;the Minister, after consultation with the Bank, may, not less than two months before the transfer date, either approve of or decline to approve of the scheme by order&rdquo;. To allow sufficient time for the necessary processes, my Department recommends submitting the transfer proposal with a minimum of two months&rsquo; notice prior to the deadline (i.e. at least four months before the proposed transfer date).  However, earlier submission is strongly advised.</p>  <p>Because the Central Bank does not disclose confidential information, neither I nor my officials will be aware of any proposed transfers of banking business until the proposal is submitted to me directly. Any bank considering transferring its business should engage with both my Department of Finance and the Central Bank at an early stage in the process.</p>  <p>  I made Orders approving two transfers of banking business in 2018, both in the context of the Brexit preparations of the banks involved. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that legislation covering Part V obligations has been amended over the years. In many cases, even residential developments currently under construction may relate to older planning permissions granted at a time when legislation provided that Part V obligations could be fulfilled through a range of options, including monetary payments to local authorities, the transfer of land, the construction and transfer of houses on-site, the transfer of houses off-site or a combination of two or more options. I am also advised that, for some NAMA-funded developments, the Part V obligations had already been met prior to the transfer of the associated loans to NAMA.  </p>  <p>  The specific means by which Part V obligations are met is the subject of negotiation between the developer and the local authority in each particular instance and ultimately it is for the local authority to determine its preference, based on its own criteria and circumstances. In relation to NAMA-funded projects, I am advised that NAMA does not participate in those negotiations. On a project-by-project basis, NAMA supports and facilitates debtors and receivers in meeting their Part V obligations, however given the broad range of options that have been open to debtors in meeting those obligations in the past, NAMA does not track the overall delivery of Part V obligations which is a matter for the local authorities.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is no statutory obligation on developers to provide affordable homes. Debtors and receivers funded by NAMA are no different in this respect from developers whose funding is from other sources.</p>  <p>  I would point out to the Deputy that, since 2012, NAMA has worked with its debtors and receivers to deliver social housing units beyond the requirements of Part V. The purpose of its social housing initiative was to maximise social housing delivery from the assets securing NAMA&rsquo;s loan portfolio. Through this programme, NAMA has delivered 2,481 units directly through approved housing bodies (AHBs), local authorities and its special purpose vehicle, NARPS.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s question in relation to a number of named development sites, the Deputy will be aware that I am prohibited from providing information on specific assets under the control of NAMA debtors and receivers as such information is considered to be confidential by reference to Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009. Agreements reached between local authorities and developers in relation to the fulfilment of Part V obligations are a matter for the parties involved. </p></reply>

NAMA is on track to have repaid all its subordinated debt and to have reimbursed the private shareholders in the NAMA DAC by that time. NAMA will have also substantially completed its residential funding programme and its Dublin Docklands SDZ programme. Once these activities have been completed NAMA will be in a position to start transferring its expected &euro;3.5bn surplus to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As the expected wind down date for NAMA&rsquo;s work approaches, there is a possibility that a small number of loans may not be resolved by 2021 due to ongoing litigation that is largely outside NAMA&rsquo;s control. In addition, there is a possibility that NAMA may also be left with a small residual loan portfolio where best value for the State may not be achieved through sale or disposal before the end of 2021. Such assets are currently expected to represent less than 1% of NAMA&rsquo;s original portfolio.</p>  <p>  Active consideration is underway regarding NAMA&rsquo;s end of life strategy and the maximisation of the return of any surplus to the State in respect of these remaining assets. These considerations will be examined in my forthcoming Section 227 review of NAMA. This review is required every 5 years under the NAMA Act to assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives and to decide whether the continuation of the agency is necessary. The previous Section 227 review was published in 2014 and current review is due to be published later this year. I intend to use the publication of the next Section 227 review to make a decision as to how to best wind down NAMA in the context of the need to ensure that the State extracts maximum value from any residual assets remaining after 2020/2021.</p></reply>

Of these connections, 139 were in support or forbearance strategies and 84 were subject to enforcement. At the same date, these debtors had a combined par debt balance of &euro;23.9bn. The value of the assets securing this debt is very low and NAMA is working to maximise the amount of debt that can be recovered for taxpayers. Such work includes negotiating effective workout strategies with debtors and receivers and providing funding for investment in assets where it will enhance value. I am advised that, in the end-year review that it recently issued, NAMA indicated that its portfolio had an estimated carrying value of &euro;2.3 billion at the end of 2018. </p></reply>

The nature of the redundancy payments has previously been outlined to the D&aacute;il and is in keeping with established public sector norms; that is, two weeks statutory pay per year of service, capped at &euro;600 per week, plus three additional weeks of base salary per year of service with an overall cap of two years base salary. </p><p>NAMA has advised that the retention portion of the scheme is being implemented in line with the stipulated parameters, agreed by the previous Minister for Finance and NAMA in March 2015, regarding the quantum of any payment under the scheme, the timing of any such payment and employee eligibility under the scheme.  Retention payments are only made where staff are departing the organisation under the Agency's redundancy programme.  The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings.  </p><p>A breakdown of the costs of the scheme to date is provided in the table following. It should be noted that included in the total VRS costs are costs associated with garden leave for employees departing under the scheme as well as statutory and other redundancy costs and a retention payment, if applicable.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Voluntary      Redundancy Scheme (VRS) Costs      &euro;m</th><th>Retention      Payments (included in total VRS costs)     &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3.6</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3.9</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Total *</td><td>8.3</td><td>2</td></tr></table>*the final figures for the 2018 VRS have not yet been finalised.</p><p>I am advised that as at 31 December 2018, 238 staff were assigned to NAMA.  I am advised that it is not yet possible to estimate the exact number of NAMA staff expected to take voluntary redundancy in 2019. Any future schemes will take into account the ongoing business needs of the Agency at that time, as determined by the NAMA Board&rsquo;s objectives. The Deputy will be aware that as Minister, I have no role in respect of NAMA's commercial operations or decisions, including determining NAMA's staffing numbers and redundancy requirements, which are internal considerations for the NAMA Chief Executive and Board. </p></reply>

The service has experienced particularly heavy demand in recent weeks and is currently dealing with approximately 4,500 telephone calls per day in addition to almost 2,000 visits per day to local offices and approximately 5,000 items of on-line and paper correspondence per day. A significant portion of the additional demand has arisen from employers updating their employee records in late 2018 in advance of the move to real-time reporting on 1 January 2019 under PAYE Modernisation.</p>  <p>  Revenue is fully aware of the recent difficulties being experienced by some PAYE customers in accessing the service and has redeployed significant resources to meet the demand. The additional resources bring the number of telephone operatives on the Helpline to over 200, which will reduce waiting times and the delays to which the Deputy is referring. Revenue has also confirmed that it will continue to monitor the demand levels each day and will further increase resources should it be necessary to do so.  </p></reply>

These Plans and projects are a key part of the overall flood risk management strategy set out in the National Development Plan 2017 - 2028 involving total investment of almost &euro;1 billion over the ten year time frame of that Plan.  As it is not possible to implement all of the 118 projects at the one time, a total of 50 projects were prioritised for the initial tranche of investment and delivery based on the level of risk and number of properties to be protected.</p>  <p>  15 flood relief projects have been identified for County Donegal as part of the 118 projects in total included in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  Following consultation and discussions between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and Donegal County Council, six of the Donegal projects have been identified to be progressed in a first phase of implementation and the OPW and the Council will be working closely over the coming year to progress these projects.  Plans are currently being put together to appoint consultants over the coming months for each of the projects to be advanced in the first phase.</p>  <p>  The proposed project at Buncrana and Luddan, Co. Donegal was assessed as a single project within the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) process and it is not currently proposed to progress separate elements of the proposed project as the progression of a piecemeal design on any project can result in the overall effectiveness of that project being compromised.  </p>  <p>  The proposed project at Buncrana and Luddan, Co. Donegal, at an estimated cost of &euro;3.3m, consists of a series of sea walls, flood embankments and flood walls, which will provide flood protection to approximately 32 properties when completed.  While the proposed project is not in the first phase of projects to be progressed, OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p></reply>

That review noted that the scale of increase in public capital spending will accentuate capacity pressures for that sector. The review highlighted the priority of reinforcing existing initiatives to meet the skills and capacity needs of the sector and support its strategic development in line with medium and long-term requirements of the Irish economy.  To that end, initiatives are ongoing in the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in my own Department and as announced in the NDP, a Construction Sector Group has been established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector. The CSG is made up of each of the key segments of the industry along with officials from relevant Departments and Agencies.  One of the main elements of the CSG's remit is the supply of necessary skills and measures enhancing capacity.  The group met twice in 2018 and will shortly finalise its work programme for 2019. </p>  <p>  The newly established Investment Projects and Programmes Office in DPER will play an important role in strengthening the appraisal and evaluation of investment projects and programmes and to ensure that public capital investment is efficient and value-for-money.  This will require the operation of the project appraisal and evaluation arrangements set out in an improved Public Spending Code as recommended by the 2017 IMF Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA).

To that end, the Government has decided that in relation to the 2019 increased costs, &euro;50 million will have to be found within the 2019 capital allocation for the Department of Health, with the remaining &euro;49 million to be met by reallocation within the overall &euro;1.5 billion (26%) increase on the 2018 REV allocation for all Departments. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, even with this adjustment, all sectors will still receive substantial additional resources in 2019 to pursue their priority projects.

These Bursaries differ from existing bursaries in a number of respects, in that they are targeted at non-traditional entry and can support undergraduate study on either a full-time or part-time basis.  The Fund provides financial support through bursaries to new entrants to higher education who are identified by regional clusters of HEIs as meeting the eligibility criteria for the Fund.  </p>  <p>  To be considered for a bursary students must be socio-economically disadvantanged and from one of the target groups identified in the National Access Plan.  Target groups include entrants from under-represented socio-economic groups and communities; entrants with disabilities; first time mature entrants; members of the Irish Traveller community; students entering on the basis of a further education award; part-time flexible learners, Lone parents and ethnic minorities </p>  <p>  The Guidelines for the 1916 Bursary Fund were drawn up by the Department of Education and Skills in partnership with the HEA to reflect the aim of the Fund to encourage participation and success in higher education by students from sections of society significantly underrepresented in higher education.  The emphasis is on encouraging learners from disadvantaged groups and communities that may never previously have considered higher education as a possible option or had any opportunity to participate in higher education. </p>  <p>  The 1916 Bursary Fund devolves the responsibility for identifying eligible students to the clusters of HEIs who are best placed to identify the target students.  Clusters of HEIs are responsible for selecting the students to be awarded bursaries and are responsible for the implementation of the Bursary fund.  As part of the student selection process the HEIs will be required to ensure that successful students meet the eligibility criteria as per the call for proposals, and as set out in section 2.4 of these guidelines.  Selection processes should be fully documented, which include an appeals process.  HEIs report to the HEA on the operation of the Fund.  The Bursary Fund will be subject to a full review an overall evaluation in year 3.</p></reply>

In the No Deal context, working with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments with responsibility for the regulation of professions, my Department is leading work to ensure, in as far as possible, the provision of arrangements with the UK to recognise professional qualifications.  As part of this process, my Department is encouraging contacts and dialogue between regulatory bodies in Ireland and the UK to facilitate the continued recognition of qualifications, including the development of protocols for transferring personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>  <p>  Should the UK Leave on the basis of an agreed Withdrawal Agreement, including a transition period, the current EU Directives will continue to apply to the UK during that time.   The EU and the UK indicated in the Political Declaration setting out the framework of the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK that during negotiations on the Future Relations they should develop appropriate arrangements on those professional qualifications which are necessary to the pursuit of regulated professions and in the Parties' mutual interest.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that persons who have had their professional qualifications recognised under the current EU Directives can continue to practice in either jurisdiction subject, of course, to compliance with all regulations within that profession.</p></reply>

This has seen a significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Primary and Post Primary Infrastructure allocation amounting to &euro;672m will be expended primarily on the delivery of large scale projects and on the Additional Accommodation Scheme. Typically, expenditure levels of between 70% and 80% of the capital allocation available to schools annually is in respect of large scale projects and the Additional Accommodation Scheme. The balance available in 2019 will be expended on site acquisitions, the Summer Works Scheme, the Emergency Works Scheme, furniture and equipment provision and other smaller programmes. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process, including schools at primary and post primary level in County Kildare. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement in April 2018 regarding the establishment of 42 new schools, including new primary schools in Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas and a new post primary school in Enfield to meet demand in the Kilcock school planning area, over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p></reply>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 will see numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level. Over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  </p>  <p>  The 2018/19 school year saw an increase of over 6000 teaching posts in our schools compared to the 2015/16 school year.  </p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.3:1 at primary level and 13.8:1 to 13.1:1 at post primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2017/18 school year.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has developed the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process which is a new process to deliver on this commitment through patronage transfer, in line with the choices of local parents and school communities.  </p><p>There are two Phases to the new process &ndash; the Identification Phase and the Implementation Phase.</p><p>The Identification Phase is currently underway in 16 areas nationwide.  Each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their functional area where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there is likely to be an oncoming demand for greater diversity of patronage in educational provision.  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs.  ETBs, having analysed the survey results, draw up comprehensive reports on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas.  This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school, or schools, to meet that oncoming demand.  The response by the landowner/patron to any identified demand for greater diversity is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, which intends to publish the final reports.<b></b></p><p>Following the finalisation of the first round of reports, it is intended that the process would move into the Implementation Phase.  This Phase involves consultation with local school communities on accommodating demand for diversity of patronage by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-/non-denominational patron.  Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development.</p><p>In relation to Kildare specifically, a town/area in County Kildare has not been identified for survey as Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board has chosen to survey Bray in Co. Wicklow as part of this initial roll-out.  A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised by ETBs when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed and any necessary adjustments made in the Schools Reconfiguration process.</p><p>The Schools Reconfiguration process, which involves the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patronage diversity in our school system. </p><p>In addition to the process outlined above, the &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; provision of this process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process) to request their existing patron to apply to the Minister for a direct transfer of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act.</p></reply>

Applications from schools for major capital works must be considered in the context of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.

The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of my Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years.  As the school in question is not located in an area of significant demographic growth, my Department is not in a position currently to consider the school's request for funding.  The position has been outlined to the school. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) provides for an &euro;8.4 billion investment in school buildings over the period 2018 to 2027 to deliver on NDP and National Planning Framework objectives through addressing the twin priorities of catering for demographics and ensuring a strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock.  This investment will result in an almost doubling of the capital budget for school buildings - &euro;540m in 2018 rising to an annual average of circa. &euro;1 billion in the second half of the NDP period.</p>  <p>  The strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands including prefab replacement, PE hall and school laboratory build and modernisation programmes as well as the commencement and progression of a deep energy retrofit of primary and post-primary schools built prior to 2008.</p></reply>

There has been some good progress on the programme in 2018, as well as in other major projects in relation to the Garda estate, including in particular completion and entry into operational use of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street Dublin, which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p>  <p>The Public Private Partnership arrangement included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme is intended to deliver new stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo as well as a new custody suite at the Garda Station at Anglesea Street, Cork.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the OPW and the Garda authorities that the OPW has acquired sites for the development of the new stations in Macroom and Caltragh, Sligo.  I am further informed that the final outstanding difficulty in relation to completion of transfer of the site at Clonmel from Tipperary County Council to the OPW has now also been resolved and the transfer is now being finalised.  On completion, ownership of all three sites will be vested in the OPW.</p>  <p>  The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  My Department is engaging with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further.  My Department is also engaging with the NDFA in relation to delivery via PPP of a Courts Service project at a site in Hammond Lane, Dublin 7. </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this point to provide a timeframe for the completion of these projects, including the new Garda station at Caltragh, Sligo.  However I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, as part of Budget 2019, the Government announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme which will commence later this year.  This new scheme will, initially, provide for 2 weeks of paid, non-transferable leave per parent, with a view to expanding the scheme in  future years.</p>  <p>  This new scheme delivers on the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, as research shows that parental care is of particular importance and benefit in the first 12 months.  The new scheme is the key recommendation of the report of an interdepartmental committee which was established to develop recommendations as to how the Programme for Partnership Government commitments could be best implemented.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available taking account of those unavailable due to illness/incapacity and having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that, as at 18/01/2019, the number of Garda&iacute; out of work due to injury received while on duty was 149, comprising 12 Sergeants and 137 Garda&iacute;. This amounts to 1% of the total number of Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This accelerated recruitment of Garda&iacute; saw Garda numbers reach just over 14,000 by the end of 2018. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians). The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline duties for which they are trained. </p>  <p>  I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will not only be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities but will also more than adequately make up for those Garda members who have unfortunately been injured on duty.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting all employees for medical or recuperative reasons following injury or a period of illness and will continue, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer, to afford all reasonable accommodations in workplace arrangements following periods of absence and on medical advice. Such accommodations may include adapted patterns of working time and modifications of duties to facilitate reintegration into the workplace. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019 including up to &euro;95 million available for the provision of overtime, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility in both rural and urban communities.</p>  <p>  This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State Michael D'Arcy TD, brings together the relevant Departments and Offices involved in undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of insurance.  Its objective is to identify immediate and longer term measures which address increasing costs, while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector. I am aware, from my own Department's active participation in the ongoing work of the Group, that the adverse impact of insurance costs and claims on voluntary and community projects which has been raised by the Deputy is among the Group's key considerations. </p>  <p>  Under Recommendation 5 of the Working Groups January 2018 Report, the Law Reform Commission was requested to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. As tasked by the Working Group, my Department wrote to the Law Reform Commission to that effect on 9 February 2018.</p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission has now, I understand, included this proposal for consideration as part of its draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform. As part of the process for its adoption, the Government has referred the draft Fifth Programme to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality which is expected to report back shortly. On that basis, it would be anticipated that the Fifth Programme will be finalised soon at which point the timeline for the delivery of its various outputs by the Law Reform Commission, including in relation to the capping of damages, will be determined.</p></reply>

At present, the Courts Service is prioritising the provision of modern facilities in those remaining regional city and county town locations where new or extended/refurbished courthouses have not been provided in recent times and the current priority locations are Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon.</p></reply>

This accelerated recruitment of Garda&iacute; saw Garda numbers reach just over 14,000 by the end of 2018. Furthermore, a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility in both rural and urban communities.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians).  The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline duties for which they are trained. I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;  to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions, including those located alongside or close to the Border.</p><p><b></b>The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p></reply>

In fact, as part of Budget 2019, the Government announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme which will commence later this year.  This new scheme will initially provide two weeks of paid, non-transferable leave per parent, with a view to expanding the scheme and increasing the number of weeks of paid leave for both parents in future years.</p>  <p>  During the debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, which is a Private Member's Bill,  I strongly suggested that the relevant Oireachtas Committee would carry out detailed pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill.

Mountjoy has designated areas to facilitate family visits which include a family friendly space, round tables/family seating and access to play materials.  In addition temporary release for access/visits to children for family occasions is regularly approved in most prisons.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also targets family friendly training to &lsquo;front of house&rsquo; staff, which aims to improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families and allows staff to appropriately support families and children visiting prisons.</p>  <p>   Upon committal to prison all prisoners are provided with a visitor nomination form which they fill out stating the names of the persons they wish to have visit them in prison. Prisoners are then allowed to change two visitors per month on their visitor panel. All adult visitors (over 18) are required to produce photographic ID upon arriving at the prison for a visit in order to gain access. All children (under 18) are recorded numerically on a visit as opposed to by name but must be accompanied by a guardian. All visitors must pass through the security screening area and may also be searched by staff. Information in relation to children visiting prisons is not recorded in the manner which would allow the prison service to extrapolate if a child visiting a prison was under the care of the State at the time of visit.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can also inform the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service has enacted the provisions of the Children First Act 2015 in respect of all visit areas. Staff have received mandatory training in Children First and Designated Liaison Persons are located in every prison. There is continual liaison between the Prison Service and Tusla regarding child protection and welfare issues. Where concerns for child welfare arise, the Irish Prison Service report to Tusla, as required under Children First.</p></reply>

In such cases, the death will not be recorded as a road fatality and the collision may be downgraded from a Fatal Road Traffic Collision.</p>  <p>  - In other cases, a Serious Injury Road Traffic Collision can be adjusted upwards to a Fatal Road Traffic Collision were a victim dies within 30 days from the date of the incident.</p>  <p>  - There are also cases, where the incident is changed from a Public Road Fatality to a Private Road Fatality, which is reported separately and may not be reflected in published statistics.</p>  <p>  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work with all relevant stakeholders in the development of accurate statistics in respect of road traffic fatalities, which are recorded in line with international best practice. </p></reply>

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of digitalisation on job roles and sectors across the economy in Ireland and to highlight the opportunities and challenges that this presents. </p><p>The study consisted of a large volume of desk research and the development of a quantitative model. This was complemented by a number of interviews with policymakers, key informants from industry, representative groups and the Regional Skills Fora, in order to gain insights for the report. The report combines all these elements to provide an assessment of the impacts of digitalisation in Ireland over the next five years, to 2023. It is available online from both the EGFSN&rsquo;s website (www.egfsn.ie) and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.dbei.gov.ie).</p><p>The report projects strong overall growth for the economy over the next five years. While the report predicts the number of jobs lost to the adoption of digital technologies will increase steadily over the next decade, it expects that the majority of sectors will employ more people in 2023 than they did in 2018. The report notes that the result of increased digitalisation in the economy will be a slower growth in employment growth, generating a hypothetical loss of 46,000 jobs. </p><p>The report further finds that one in three jobs in Ireland are at high risk of being disrupted by the adoption of digital technologies. Much of the disruption, however, will result in changes to job roles and tasks performed by individuals rather than job losses. This means that lifelong learning will become even more of an imperative and the report finds that there will be opportunities for many people to upskill within their current jobs.</p><p>The report highlighted how the Government is already acting to address the challenges and mitigate the negative impacts of automation on job numbers. </p><p>The report finds that Ireland has the opportunity to place itself at the forefront of digital technologies through ensuring adequate skills provision and capitalising on Ireland's significant ICT sector. It finds that that existing Government policies and initiatives currently in place provide a solid foundation for response to the expected changes from the increased adoption of digital technologies. The following table, as provided in the report, demonstrates the various ways in which the Government is acting to mitigate the impact of automation on job numbers.</p><p>Table 1 Current Policies and Initiatives in Place Addressing Five Key Areas of Focus<table><tr><th>Key Areas </th><th>Policies and Initiatives Addressing Areas </th></tr><tr><td>Vision </td><td>National Digital Strategy </td></tr><tr><td>Collaboration </td><td>R&amp;amp;D Technology Centres/GatewaysInnovation PartnershipsSFI Industry Fellowships</td></tr><tr><td>Data </td><td>National Data Infrastructure </td></tr><tr><td>Technology </td><td>Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund Industry 4.0 Strategy </td></tr><tr><td>Skills </td><td>National Skills Strategy 2025 ICT Action Plan National Digital Strategy for SchoolsSkills for Growth Initiative Spotlight on SkillsSkillnet Ireland Springboard+EXPLORE</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to these measures, to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economy is well positioned to adapt and prosper in the future, the Government is launching a new economic pathway for Ireland &ndash; Future Jobs - Preparing Now for Tomorrow's Economy. Future Jobs Ireland aims to drive Ireland&rsquo;s development as a resilient, innovative and globally connected economy, capable of coping with transformational changes ahead posed by automation, artificial intelligence and other forms of technological innovation.  Future Jobs is a medium-term framework out to 2025 and the 2019 iteration will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In focusing on these cohorts, the analysis identified issues for further examination. </p>  <p>  The results of the detailed analysis of Action 28 cannot be published due to CSO stipulations around sample size and data confidentiality.

Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.</p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  For the State as a whole, since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (Q1 2015 to Q3 2018) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment, with 163,500 of these located in the regions outside Co. Dublin &ndash; that&rsquo;s 3 out of every 5 jobs created.</p>  <p>  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Midlands has seen good progress, with employment in the region increasing by 17.6% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 19,100 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015, the start of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process, to Q3 2018. </p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands Region is currently at 7.1% (Q3 2018), which is higher than the State average of 6% and continued focus is therefore required on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) administered by Enterprise Ireland is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. To date the Fund has supported 42 support significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives around the country to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.</p>  <p>  Under the REDF first call, I was very pleased to announce that Irish Manufacturing Research CLG based in Mullingar, were approved over &euro;2 million in funding to support the development of this important asset for the manufacturing sector in the region. A further two projects for the Midlands received an allocation under the second call, totalling just over &euro;650,000; namely Mountmellick Development Association and Offaly Innovation and Design Centre (Birr).</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.   </p>  <p>  That is why in April 2018, I asked the RAPJ Implementation Committees, including in the Midlands, to refresh and refocus their plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit. This work is ongoing and I expect to launch the refreshed Regional Enterprise Plan for the Midlands next month. The Regional Enterprise Plan will continue to add value to the core mandates of the enterprise agencies by bringing together regional stakeholders to work collaboratively on projects to support enterprise development.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is also committed to playing its part in the economic development of Irelands Regions. IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. </p>  <p>  The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in County Westmeath, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.  </p>  <p>  There are now 42 IDA supported companies based in the Midlands, employing 5,720 people in 2018. This employment figure represents a 14% increase on 2017. The Midlands Region was the highest performing Region in terms of FDI employment growth in Ireland during 2018. The Region has been successful over a number of years in mobilising inward foreign direct investment (FDI), with employment levels in IDA client companies increasing every year since 2011. County Westmeath specifically has performed well with 3,466 people employed in 2018 in FDI companies, an increase of 16.5% over the 2017 figures.</p>  <p>  Across the Region, IDA Ireland has a portfolio of Business &amp;amp; Technology Parks available to support IDA and EI client companies. These flagship Business Parks in key locations, including Mullingar, have been designed and landscaped to a high standard and are occupied by many high end manufacturing and international services clients with capacity to facilitate and accommodate new international investment.  IDA also works closely with the private sector to encourage and market appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions suitable for FDI clients.  </p>  <p>  The region has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with particular strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services and Engineering. Significant &lsquo;new name&rsquo; investments in recent years in both services and manufacturing include Aerie Pharmaceutical, Neueda Technologies (both based in Athlone), SkOUT Secure Intelligence in Portlaoise and Red Seal Cups in Longford. The largest new name project has been Centre Parcs, which is a &euro;233m development in Ballymahon, Co. Longford that will see 1,000 people employed when fully operational in 2019. </p>  <p>  Expansions of scale from the existing client base over recent years included projects from Ericsson and NPD in Athlone, Abbott in Longford and Avery Denison in Longford.  The existing FDI base of companies enjoy strong collaborative links with the Athlone Institute of Technology and the presence of a third level Institute of scale has been key to the development of the Region. </p>  <p>  The availability of appropriate property solutions continues to be a strategic asset supporting the winning of FDI. To support the delivery of IDA&rsquo;s current strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019, a &euro;150m property investment plan was announced in February 2015. This investment focus is on the building of Advance Building Solutions (ABS), infrastructure investment in a number of Utility Intensive Strategic site solutions and the upgrade of Business and Technology Parks within IDA's national portfolio.  IDA&rsquo;s property investment programme for the Midlands Region included the construction of an Advance Building Solution (ABS) in the Athlone Business &amp;amp; Technology Park, which facilitated Aerie Pharmaceutical in establishing a new ophthalmic production facility and the creation of 50 high jobs. </p>  <p>  IDA&rsquo;s focus over the coming two years and beyond is to build on the strengths and competencies of the Midlands Region with a particular focus on high value manufacturing, services and research and development opportunities across a number of established clusters in Life Sciences, Technology, and Global Business Services. Emerging technology trends have and will continue to create new opportunities across the region in areas such as data analytics, smart manufacturing, cybersecurity and new approaches to working such as home working and hub working.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with existing clients to retain and strengthen their presence through continued company transformation as well as pursuing new areas of opportunity for clients companies. IDA will continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland and its indigenous base of companies to identify synergies, enhance clusters, participate in site visits and maximise benefits for the Region.</p>  <p>  Enhanced collaboration will be needed to align the efforts of all stakeholders and service providers to ensure that the Midlands Region continues to meet the needs of overseas companies. The delivery of necessary infrastructure and property solutions, fostering the continued development and growth of a skilled workforce and the continued development of the place-making of the Region are pre-requisites to winning continued FDI investment. Such collaboration can act as a catalyst to attracting new companies and talent to the Midlands. </p>  <p>  The Midlands Region is very well positioned to continue to attract new FDI investment and grow employment in existing companies and IDA Ireland will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders and parties in the Region to achieve this objective under the refreshed Regional Enterprise Plan.</p></reply>

I am pleased to say that significant progress is being made with 58% of all IDA employment now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organization. 2018 saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. </p><p>Counties Westmeath and Longford are both marketed by the IDA as part of the wider Midlands region.  There are now 42 multinational companies based in the Midlands, employing 5,720 people.

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p><p>In addition to the direct supports outlined in the table below, my Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.  </p><p>Further to the below, increased funding has been allocated to Brexit-related support from my Department and its agencies as part of Budget 2019. An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to Intertrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. Additional resources have also been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p><p>While many businesses have taken preparedness actions, a number have yet to do so. It is vital that businesses prepare themselves for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (18.01)</th><th>Expenditure on Scheme (18.01)</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>375 applications received, 336 approved by SBCI, 65 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;14.94 million.</td><td>&euro;23 million Exchequer Funding (&euro;14 million from my DBEI and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td>3,902 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 681 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td><td>2017 Expenditure: &euro;25,568 2018 Expenditure: &euro;11,261 <br /><br />Total Expenditure: &euro;36,829 <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>155 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td><td>2017 Expenditure: &euro;10,0002018 Expenditure: &euro;178,8712019 Expenditure to date: &euro;12,623<br /><br />Total Expenditure: &euro;201,494</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new   markets</td><td>209 projects have been approved under this initiative</td><td>Market Discovery fund was launched in 20182018 Expenditure: &euro;227,7432019 Expenditure to date: &euro;108,914  <br /><br />Total Expenditure: &euro;336,657</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td>39 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td><td>Agile Innovation Fund was launched in 2018 2018 Expenditure: &euro;385,2642019 Expenditure to date: &euro;51,892<br /><br />Total Expenditure: &euro;437,156</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>11 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with approx. 915 in attendance</td><td>2017 Expenditure: &euro;55,7972018 Expenditure: &euro;166,6982019 Expenditure to date: &euro;1,722<br /><br />Total Expenditure: &euro;224,217</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>165 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td><td><br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;330,000</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>1,049 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td><td>2016 Expenditure: &euro;278,1372017 Expenditure: &euro;482,6172018 Expenditure: &euro;456,1982019 Expenditure to date: &euro;61,764Total Expenditure: &euro;1,278,716</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit-exposed companies that have completed sustainable growth plans</td><td>706</td><td>N/A These growth plans are part of the Client Engagement Model</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant   for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td>419 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant</td><td>&euro;365,774</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>221 LEO clients have participated in the programme </td><td>&euro;518,411</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>471 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit </td><td>No specific amount is allocated to Brexit mentoring specifically, it is part of the overall Measure 2 allocation.

It was established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. CORU is responsible for the regulation of the 17 professions designated by the Act.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Act provides that, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I, as Minister for Health, may make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already contained in the Act. My primary consideration in the regulation of other professions is the protection of the public and in this regard I have asked CORU to facilitate a risk assessment of the principal health and social care professionals seeking regulation. This risk assessment will include play therapists. I expect the assessment to be completed by mid 2019 and it will then inform the decisions I make regarding the future regulation of any further professions.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that while play therapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are subject to a range of legislation and regulation, similar to other service providers, including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.  It is open to persons to contact a solicitor should they wish to pursue these avenues.</p></reply>

Following closure of the scheme, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

As part of this function, the NTPF enters into &quot;Approved Nursing Home Agreements&quot; with registered private and voluntary nursing homes to record the maximum price(s) that have been negotiated.  The NTPF are independent in its functions and the Department of Health plays no role in these negotiations.</p><p>The NTPF take the following guidelines into account in negotiating prices; (a) costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money, (b) price(s) previously charged, (c) local market price and (d) budgetary constraints and the obligation of the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public. </p><p>In relation to the Number of reviews (appeals) carried out with regard to price negotiations the below table details the number of appeals made to the NTPF from 2010 to date.

The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail.  </p><p>In relation to the number of submissions received during the pricing review, I can confirm that one submission was received. However, the external experts commissioned by the NTPF to provide expert input to the Review undertook a stakeholder engagement exercise as part of their work. In this regard, there were twenty separate engagements with relevant parties, including four individual nursing homes. </p><p>The NTPF are now close to completing the report and aim to discuss the latest draft of the report and next steps early this year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-22a.771.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012200071#WRP01500"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as A Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p>  - Bed and board;</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that residents of nursing homes should enjoy the same levels of support and access to services as when they lived in their own homes. It is of course acknowledged that the reason they require 24 hour levels of support is due to their level of dependency, which in turn will require inevitably access to clinical services including hospital and other outpatient appointments in the community. The HSE provides for a level of Intermediate Care Vehicles, which are used predominantly for non-emergency transport between acute hospitals for admission and discharge purposes. They would be reserved for those who would need specific support in transport and other than that normal transport arrangements apply. These arrangements (e.g. wheelchair taxi) are normally funded by the individual.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).</p></reply>

Any revision of these medical card income thresholds requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs. This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses. The general scheme, although having lower income thresholds, provides for income disregards and relevant outgoings to be taken into account in the assessment process.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances. In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provided for increases in a number of social welfare payments which are intended to come into effect in March 2019.

It is against this background that the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 recommended an increase in acute hospitals beds of over 2,600 by 2031 to support the projected increase in demand for services in the years ahead. </p><p>Increasing capacity is a priority for the Government in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review.  In this context, an additional 240 beds have been opened over the past 12 months and the HSE's National Service Plan provides for a comprehensive capacity programme for 2019.  The main elements of the programme are:</p><p>- the opening of 78 new beds by the end of the first quarter of 2019;</p><p>- the opening of an additional 75 acute beds and 70 community beds during 2019, as part of the Winter Plan;</p><p>- preparation of 202 beds this year, to be operational in the first quarter of 2020, including beds in Mayo University Hospital.</p><p>The HSE is currently also developing its Capital Plan for 2019. The requirements of Mayo University Hospital and other health capital projects at various stages of development are being considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

In addition, measures have been put in place to ensure that retrospective costs are reimbursed, while an automatic review system is in place to simplify and streamline the claims process to ensure prompt payment of all items covered by the Government decision.  To date, just over &euro;1.18m has been reimbursed in respect of various health and social care costs, almost &euro;910,000 of which relates to retrospective payments.  In addition, some 693 medical cards have been issued as part of the supports package, while women are also being supported in accessing certain drugs, the costs of which are also being met by the HSE.</p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April.  </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.  </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year.  This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of women awaiting the results of a repeat smear test,  I have asked the HSE to provide this information directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is against this background that the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 recommended an increase in acute hospitals beds of over 2,600 by 2031 to support the projected increase in demand for services in the years ahead.</p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP), published last year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, provides &euro;10.9 billion to invest in infrastructure, equipment and additional service capacity for the public health sector over the next 10 years in line with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare. </p><p>Health capital investments over the coming decade will support existing Government priority projects and commitments, facilitate the shift to new models of care and enable the roll-out of new additional capacity, guided by the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare. </p><p>The developments that this capital investment will enable include:  </p><p>- 2,600 additional acute hospital beds;</p><p>- 4,500 additional long and short-term beds;</p><p>- Elective only hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway;</p><p>- significant investment in modern e-health and ICT infrastructure;</p><p>- Additional Primary Care facilities with greater access to diagnostics;</p><p>- Additional facilities for mental health services and for people with disabilities.</p><p>Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue and these major priority projects will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the Plan to 2022.</p><p>Increasing capacity is a priority for the Government in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review. In this context, an additional 240 beds have been opened over the past 12 months and the HSE's National Service Plan provides for a comprehensive capacity programme for 2019.  The main elements of the this programme include:</p><p>- the opening of 78 new beds by the end of the first quarter of 2019;</p><p>- the opening of an additional 75 acute beds and 70 community beds during 2019, as part of the Winter Plan;</p><p>- preparation of 202 beds this year, to be operational in the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the NDP and implementing Sl&aacute;intecare are long-term plans. Many capital proposals are at an early stage and,  as with all capital development proposals, will require further appraisal, planning, design and tender before a firm timeline or funding required can be established.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2019. The requirements for bed capacity and other health capital projects, currently at various stages of development, are being considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

The Access Plan will also set out activity levels for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) who, following an increase in funding in Budget 2019 to &euro;75 million, will supply additionality to HSE activity by arranging both insourced and outsourced appointments and treatments to reduce waiting times experienced by patients. </p>  <p>  The Access Plan is being developed to ensure an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. The NTPF will do this by inviting public hospitals to seek solutions for very long waiters either in the private sector or through insourcing. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that in 2018 they arranged 10,847 surgical procedures and 2637 GI scopes in private hospitals.

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year.  The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early this year.  However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment during 2019.  Officials in my Department are currently examining options in relation to the operation and administration of this fund, which includes determining the access criteria that will apply.  Once I have had the opportunity to review and approve these proposals, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund for 2019.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community. </p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme. The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users.</p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment). </p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skill set outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.</p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning. </p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance.</p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE. Recruitment commenced to develop these national teams in 2018. </p>  <p>  The new posts includes one consultant endocrinologist (adult services), one consultant endocrinologist (paediatric services), one social worker (adult services), one speech and language therapist (adult services), one senior psychologist (adult services), one senior psychologist (paediatric services), one clinical nurse specialist (Paediatric services), two administrative support officers (adult and paediatric services). This investment is a concerted measure by the HSE to address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition. </p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to building mental health, acute hospital and primary care services for transgender children, adolescents and adults in accordance with international best practice. </p></reply>

In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicines Shortages Framework to mitigate the impact of medicine shortages when they occur, and this framework is used to successfully manage an average of 45 shortage notifications a month. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  There is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines ahead of Brexit. To do so could, in itself, disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit - to date no major issues have been identified through this process.</p></reply>

It is intended that the cost of progressing the project to design, planning and construction stages will be considered in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019, which is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  A National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services is currently underway. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.</p></reply>

Several of the PSI&rsquo;s functions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 relate to education, including promoting and ensuring the highest standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, and make sure that relevant experience is gained in the course of that pharmacy education and training.</p>  <p>  In 2010 the PSI commissioned a review of the five year programme of education and training for the pharmacist qualification in Ireland.  One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.</p>  <p>  A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment.  The National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Interim Report of November 2013 noted that it was an essential component of the integrated degree that the student remain a student for the full five years of study.  Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year.</p>  <p>  Since September 2015, students commencing their pharmacy education undertake a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master's degree programme in pharmacy, with the first cohort awarded this MPharm degree graduating in 2020.  This programme is operated by the schools of pharmacy in three universities in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and Royal College of Surgeons Ireland).</p>  <p>  This newer pharmacy programme provides for both the academic and practical experience that is required by students to qualify to practise as a pharmacist in Ireland.  Students qualify after 5 years with a Masters in Pharmacy and are eligible to apply for registration as a pharmacist with the PSI.</p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules 2014 (S.I. No. 377 of 2014) is the legislation which underpins the new 5 year MPharm educational programme.  It includes the programme recognition and accreditation requirements, and details about the in-service training placements for students.</p>  <p>  Part of the PSI&rsquo;s accreditation process involves visits to the universities operating the MPharm programme, which includes meeting with representative students at each School of Pharmacy.  The accreditation teams assess the programme of training and education various standards, including one related to students and the supports available to students.</p>  <p>  The PSI has stated that it will continue to engage with the academic institutions that deliver the MPharm programme and their role is to ensure the quality of the MPharm programme and high standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

These were implemented in recognition of, and to reflect, the need to prepare well in advance of completion of the facilities for integration of the clinical and non-clinical services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals, preparation for the opening of the Outpatient and Urgent Care centres and the need to manage dependencies across the various components of the project which will support the operation of the new hospital.  </p>  <p>  The CHP&amp;P Board is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health (DoH) and comprising the Director General (DG) of the HSE, Assistant Secretary of the Acute Hospital Policy Division in the DoH, and the HSE Deputy Director General Strategy (DDG).

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p></reply>

The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  </p><p>All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.</p><p>The initial authorisation of Gardasil was supported by the results from the study known as Future II.  This study concluded that in young women who had not been previously infected with HPV-16 or HPV-18, those in the vaccine group had a significantly lower occurrence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia related to HPV-16 or HPV-18 than did those in the placebo group.</p><p>Subsequently the results from Future III updated the product information for Gardasil in relation to the vaccination of women up to 45 years old.</p><p>The trials for Future II or Future III were not conducted in Ireland and therefore the HPRA did not have access to the original clinical trial submissions, however, the results of the studies are publically available at <i>www.ema.europa.eu/documents/scientific-discussion/gardasil-epar-scientific-discussion_en.pdf).</i></p><p>In both the Future II and Future III studies participants were randomised to either a vaccine group or placebo group.  The currently licensed quadrivalent Gardasil product contains 0.225 mg amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate per 0.5 ml dose. Placebo product used in the control arms of the referenced studies contained the same amount of aluminium-containing adjuvant.  The use of the aluminium-containing adjuvant in the placebo group is stated in the study documents referenced above. </p><p>A placebo arm is an important aspect of many clinical studies and supports the evaluation of the true overall effect of the experimental drug under study. There is a strong rationale for using a placebo in large pivotal studies as it is widely considered to be the most rigorous method of evaluating the efficacy of treatment or prevention interventions. The only difference in composition between the placebo and vaccine in the above-mentioned Gardasil trials was the absence of active substances (HPV virus type proteins) in the placebo. This allows the effects observed in the clinical study to be attributed to the vaccine product.</p></reply>

Following the Mid-term Review of the Forestry Programme I introduced increased grant and premium rates for native woodlands, agro-forestry and forestry for fibre Grant and Premium Categories in early 2018 aiming at increasing the annual broadleaf planting rates.  I am pleased to note that the increased rates in the broadleaf categories have already provided results, with broadleaves comprising 27% of trees planted in 2018, compared to 21% in 2017.  It is our full intention to drive this figure higher in 2019 based on the increased grants and premia offered above. </p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our exposure to the UK market in particular following Brexit. </p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in market development, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia in 2018.  These missions included participants from across the agri-food sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  </p>  <p>  The destinations for trade missions for 2019 are currently under consideration and I expect to be in a position to announce them shortly.</p></reply>

The retention of a sufficient budget for the CAP is an essential requirement for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I have been actively engaging with my European counterparts on this issue. Along with counterparts from France, Spain, Finland, Portugal and Greece, we have called for the restoration of the CAP budget for the 2021 &ndash; 2027 period to current levels.  Up to 20 Member States have joined this alliance and we will continue to work together in an effort to build consensus on this point.  I recognise that to achieve the best outcome, we need to seek common ground with like minded Member States.  Ireland will continue to seek to build alliances as the negotiations for the next CAP and its budgetary allocation progress and I will continue to fight for a strong CAP budget. </p>  <p>  As regards the CAP legislative proposals themselves, the new regulations for the CAP 2021-27 were launched on Friday 1 June 2018 by Commissioner Hogan.  The existing four CAP Regulations (1305/2013, 1306/2013, 1307/2013 and 1308/2013) are being replaced by three new Regulations.  The Direct Payments Regulation (1307/2013) and the Rural Development Regulation (1305/2013 are being consolidated in one Regulation which establishes rules on the CAP strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States. The European Commission's objective is to have the proposals adopted by the co-legislators in Spring 2019, prior to the European Parliament Elections in May.</p>  <p>  The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. There will be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in Council Regulations. Risk management measures, and measures to support young farmers and new entrants will be mandatory, and there will be a significant emphasis on education and technology adoption. At least 5% of rural development funds will be ring fenced for the LEADER Programme. </p>  <p>  The current proposals require Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan to the Commission for approval before the deadline of 1 January 2020. My Department is working towards this deadline. The process of developing the draft CSP will be a complex process, involving a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design,  ex ante evaluation including a Strategic Environmental Assessment  and Appropriate Assessment. A central element of this process will be on-going and substantive stakeholder and public consultation which will include the farm organisations. </p>  <p>  The new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p></reply>

This segregation is desirable from both operational and health &amp;amp; safety points of view.</p>  <p>  As is the case for all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any decision with regard to initiating a project to provide additional berthing space in Howth will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities</p>  <p>  No final decisions have been made on the full suite of projects to be undertaken as part of  the 2019 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, however I expect to make an announcement on this matter shortly.</p></reply>

We must also acknowledge the exposure of the sector to Brexit impacts.</p>  <p>  However, one of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.  I have utilised the Beef Round table to highlight the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency and to support the sector through examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations.  Officials from my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the beef sector, in the last Budget I secured &euro;20 million for a new Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. </p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agri-food sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  It is also envisaged that suckler farmers will be the primary beneficiaries of the &euro;23 million ANC increase in addition to the &euro;20 million available under the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot.</p>  <p>  Securing new market access and enhancing existing Irish beef access has been a particular priority for many of the trade missions in 2017 and 2018. The opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef last year was the culmination of significant work, over a number of years.  My Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain market access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish beef products.</p></reply>

While enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities of approximately &euro;1 million per annum and of the network of local authority waste enforcement officers of approximately &euro;7.4 million per annum. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since 2017 funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available from the Environment Fund in this regard which has supported over 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating black spots and equipping local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws. </p>  <p>  A review of this initiative is underway which will inform a 2019 anti-dumping work programme that will place an increased emphasis on all actors who facilitate the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste.</p></reply>

During this period, Irish applicants submitted a total of 28 eligible CEF applications for transport projects. This includes projects also involving other Member States, for funding for multi-beneficiary actions, which I have further detailed below. Three transport-related CEF funding applications of relevance to Ireland were submitted as part of the 2018 CEF call for proposals. These applications are currently being evaluated and assessed by the European Commission, with a decision to be made in the first half of 2019.</p>  <p>  CEF funding is allocated in the form of grants awarded to successful applicants following competitive calls for proposals, which are published on the website of the European Commission. Each call has specific funding priorities and explicit criteria for activities that are eligible for funding under that individual call and calls vary from year to year. </p>  <p>  Irish beneficiaries have to date received over &euro;90.1 million for projects on Ireland's Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network. This figure includes funding where Irish project promoters have successfully joined with project promoters across other EU Member States. These would include successful applications for the deployment of Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) and road transport projects with other Member States, which includes studies on the harmonisation of interoperable intelligent transport systems (ITS) and cooperative Intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). The ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes have all been successful in applying for and obtaining CEF funding. </p>  <p>  Motorways of the Sea is considered a horizontal priority of CEF and constitutes the maritime pillar of CEF. It is a separate and smaller funding stream under the overall CEF allocation, and it aims to promote green, viable, attractive and efficient sea-based transport links which are integrated into the entire transport chain. </p>  <p>  There have been two successful Irish applications for Motorways of the Sea funding. These were both joint applications for funding made with entities in other Member States.</p>  <p>  Details of all Irish successful proposals for CEF funding, including successful Motorways of the Sea proposals, are available on the website of the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to state that my answer to this question is with regard to transport projects only.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-22a.1367.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012200081#WRZ05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 526 to 528, inclusive, 532, 553 and 557 together.</p>  <p>  Rosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but is instead operated on commercial basis as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. </p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department.</p>  <p>  The Minister is satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the Port over the coming years.</p>  <p>  I have met individually with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, to discuss Brexit matters on three occasions since mid-2017. I most recently met the Secretary of State, at his request, in Dublin on 8 November last.  Our discussion fully respected the mandate of the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Secretary of State outlined key areas of concern for the UK in relation to transport. </p>  <p>  While I did not specifically raise the issue of ownership of Rosslare Europort with the Secretary of State, I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including in relation to ports, aviation, road transport, and cross-border rail services. I stressed the importance of finalising the Withdrawal Agreement, highlighted the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports.    </p>  <p>  I stressed that as regards the future EU-UK relationship, Ireland wants to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, across a range of areas including transport. At the same time, I re-iterated the importance of preserving the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and that the EU&rsquo;s regulatory autonomy is respected.</p>  <p>  I recognise that Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports, and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for the additional border controls that will arise from Brexit.  In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year, most recently last week, about the infrastructure requirements of the Port in connection with Brexit.  My Department has also been meeting ferry and shipping companies regarding their plans for dealing with the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

As I have stated previously, my Department will be making a submission to the European Commission calling for an early review of the TEN-T Network, taking into account our National Development Plan, our National Planning Framework, and the implications of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Separately, there are nine multimodal EU Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) Core Network Corridors, which aim to streamline the coordinated development of the overall TEN-T Core Network.  Of these nine Corridors, the &ldquo;North Sea Mediterranean Corridor&rdquo; or &ldquo;NSMED Corridor&rdquo; is the only corridor that includes the UK and Ireland. This Corridor map outlines a link from Ireland to the UK, through the UK land bridge, and on to continental Europe.  </p>  <p>  In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the European Commission has proposed an Amendment to Regulation (EU) No. 1316/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which would realign the NSMED Core Network Corridor given that the UK will no longer form part of the Corridor or the TEN-T network.  This proposal seeks to ensure that the NSMED Corridor does not become fragmented as a result of Brexit, and will take effect only when the CEF Regulation no longer applies to the UK.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to revise the current alignment of the NSMED Corridor with linkages between Ireland (Cork and Dublin) and the ports of Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Antwerp. Ireland also echoed calls from France for further TEN-T links to French ports and Ireland has also made clear to the European Commission that it would support any further proposals from the Commission or other Member States to facilitate enhanced maritime connections between Member States that will mitigate the impact of the UK departure.</p>  <p>  A proposal for a new Regulation for CEF - the funding mechanism for TEN-T from 2021 - is also currently under consideration.  In the latest draft, the Commission has accepted Ireland's proposal, made jointly with Malta and Cyprus, that funding be provided for infrastructure on the Comprehensive Network in Member States where there is no land border with another EU Member State. If this is maintained as part of the final agreed Regulation, it will mean that organisations will continue to  be eligible to apply for funding for projects coming within the application criteria after 2020.       </p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission in relation to the TEN-T network in the context of Brexit, including in relation to the EU&rsquo;s proposal outlined above, and my Department has raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the implications for connectivity and trade in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU.</p></reply>

This Corridor map outlines a link from Ireland to the UK, through the UK land bridge, and on to continental Europe.</p>  <p>  In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the European Commission has proposed an Amendment to Regulation (EU) No. 1316/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which would realign the NSMED Core Network Corridor given that the UK will no longer form part of the Corridor or the TEN-T network.  This proposal seeks to ensure that the NSMED Corridor does not become fragmented as a result of Brexit, and will take effect only when the CEF Regulation no longer applies to the UK.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to revise the current alignment of the NSMED Corridor with linkages between Ireland (Cork and Dublin) and the ports of Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Antwerp. Ireland also echoed calls from France for further TEN-T links to French ports and Ireland has also made clear to the European Commission that it would support any further proposals from the Commission or other Member States to facilitate enhanced maritime connections between Member States that will mitigate the impact of the UK departure.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission in relation to the TEN-T network in the context of Brexit, including in relation to the EU&rsquo;s proposal outlined above, and my Department has raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the implications for connectivity and trade in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  Ireland is very concerned about the impact of Brexit on the landbridge route to continental markets. The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) report, published in November 2018, estimates that the annual volume of Roll on/Roll off (RoRo) traffic using the landbridge to transport goods to and from the continent is approximately 3 million tonnes, which equates to approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles. The total value of trade with the EU using the landbridge is estimated to be &euro;21 billion, and may well be higher. This is a significant proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade and a significant aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s international road haulage sector.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the study, the landbridge is a strategically important route to market for many Irish importers and exporters and certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by Brexit, mainly those that trade in time sensitive goods, e.g. Agri-food, seafood etc. The study recommends that Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to the UK landbridge is protected in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing liaison between Ireland, the European Commission and other similar affected Member States on matters relating to the land bridge. </p>  <p>  However, I have also assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge. I recognise that the longer journey time on these direct routes may not offer a viable alternative and some trade will continue to use the Landbridge or, in the event of significant delays, may become unviable.           </p>  <p>  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider, I have advised Government that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019, and if demand for further capacity arises, the shipping sector can respond quickly. I am keeping this matter under review and will update Government again before end-February 2019.</p></reply>

The Dublin - Rosslare Europort rail line is on the TEN-T comprehensive network and does not form part of the TEN-T Core Network.</p>  <p>  The EU TEN-T Regulations when adopted in 2013 identified, by way of maps, the routes included in Europe&rsquo;s comprehensive and core transport networks. As I have outlined in responses to previous parliamentary questions, the EU&rsquo;s planning methodology explicitly set out the criteria that was used in the identification of the comprehensive network, as well as those parts of the network that are identified as the core network.</p>  <p>  My Department will soon make a submission to the European Commission in respect of the TEN-T network, taking account of the implications of Brexit, the current National Development Plan and National Planning Framework.  As stipulated in the 2013 TEN-T Regulation, there is to be a review of the implementation of the core network by the end 2023. The submission by my Department will call for an early review of the TEN-T Core Network. </p>  <p>  A proposal for a new Regulation for the Connecting Europe Facility - the funding mechanism for TEN-T from 2021 - is currently under consideration.  In the latest draft, the Commission has accepted Ireland's proposal, made jointly with Malta and Cyprus, that funding be provided for infrastructure on the Comprehensive Network in Member States where there is no land border with another EU Member State. If this is maintained as part of the final agreed Regulation, it will mean that the railway line to Rosslare and indeed Rosslare Port itself will continue to  be eligible to apply for funding for projects coming within the application criteria.</p></reply>

This is relevant to all our Ports of National Significance, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 (Ports of Waterford and Rosslare), given their potential role in maintaining transportation linkages with crucial EU markets. </p>  <p>  In terms of Brexit,  a whole-of Government approach has been adopted in relation to our key ports  through the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Committee to ensure that ports have the necessary infrastructure in place for Brexit. </p>  <p>  All three Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) &ndash; Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes &ndash; are currently undertaking major capital infrastructure programmes. These programmes will enhance national and international connectivity, and provide for future increases in trade and national port capacity requirements by facilitating more vessels, larger sized vessels and increased tonnage and throughput. All of these developments must be financed by the companies themselves without recourse to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Irish Rail has recently  completed a detailed report on Rosslare and a &euro;15 million plan to  transform Rosslare Europort has been approved by the board. Irish Rail and Rosslare Europort are committed to an investment plan for the year. </p>  <p>  In the context of connectivity from East to West of the country, the National Development Plan (NDP) specifies that there will be significant investment in connectivity through improved roads and international access and supply chains through our Ports.  </p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the questions  to TII for a more detailed and direct reply on the issues raised concerning national road infrastructure projects.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days</p></reply>

Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues. I have asked officials to make contact with Fingal Childcare Committee to follow up on your question. Your constituent may also wish to make contact with them seeking assistance. Also, if your constituent is considering childminding services, Childminding Ireland may be able to direct them to some of their members in the area.</p>  <p>  Each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including the monitoring of capacity. The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November and relates to the 2017/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision, in general, meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.</p>  <p>  This report outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in  Dublin - Fingal, i.e., 11,149 children enrolled in registered services with 450 vacant childcare places. It also identifies waiting lists totalling 1,076 children. Pobal reports that nationally the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos. Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list. </p>  <p>  With regard to capacity generally, I secured &euro;8.86 m in capital funding for childcare in 2019. While the precise details of the 2019 Capital offering have yet to be finalised, this funding will be used to meet the most pressing needs of the sector with the ultimate aim of benefitting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure and capacity. A particular focus in 2019 will be to expand service provision for children under three years of age.  </p>  <p>  Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities. I am delighted that &euro;250 million in additional funding has been committed to for the expansion of high quality, early learning and care and school age childcare over the duration of the Plan.</p></reply>

The Early Years Division of my Department has also developed a strong track record for working closely with a wide range of stakeholders as we collectively seek to build the best possible early learning and care and school age childcare sector for children and their families. </p>  <p>  Progress made in recent years on the development of policy has been achieved in collaboration and consultation with the sector. The changes underway to achieve our mutual goals can only be achieved by working together and the Government's support for the shared vision with the sector has been evidenced by the 117% increase in investment over the past four budgets. </p>  <p>  On becoming Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I established the Early Years Forum so that my officials and I could communicate on a structured basis with stakeholders from the sector. Members include, for example, representatives of private and community providers, academics, representative of children's rights organisations and parent representatives. This Forum, which I chair, meets at least biannually to discuss and inform early years policy. Member of the group in turn communicate with their members to ensure a good two-way cascade of information and influence. </p>  <p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees around the country which are sources of valuable local information on the sector. Both the staff of these organisations and their boards have vast insight into the challenges of the sector. I regularly visit these organisations to hear from them  how we can continue to improve policy. My officials meet with their umbrella organisation, CCI, on a regular basis to ensure that policy is informed by experiences on the ground. My Department also funds a number of National Voluntary Childcare Organisations which again bring matters to our attention and with which we consult regularly. I meet  some of these in structured meetings or as part of visits or conferences I engage with.</p>  <p>  Key pieces of policy work such as the preparation of our new 10 year strategy, First 5, or the Affordable Childcare Scheme, warrant additional focused engagement with the sector.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme  (ACS) was first informed by an Open Policy Debate in 2015 as part of the work of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future investment in Childcare. Various representatives of the sector made a valuable contribution to the debate and the IDG report reflects their input. During the development of the policy of the scheme there was a public consultation and more than 4,000 responses were received and analysed.  The ACS project currently utilises a number of smaller working groups of key stakeholders to inform ongoing development. For example, the ACS team has conducted focus groups, completed usability testing and chaired working groups directly with parents and sample groups of childcare providers to test, review and refine the scheme in an iterative process to design a system that will be user friendly for both parents and childcare providers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore regarding the ACS, there will be several hundred training and information events for childcare providers and their staff announced shortly to prepare for the launch of the scheme later this year. In 2017, eight roadshow events took place nationwide, attended by almost 1,000 childcare practitioners, to discuss plans at that stage, including the September 2017 measures and the introduction of Programme Support Payments.  Feedback at the events influenced policy formulation.</p>  <p>  As part of the development of First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, a number of early learning and care providers and provider representative organisations participated in opportunities for engagement, including at two Open Policy Debates that I participated in.  At one of these events, I asked two providers, one private and one community, to address the group of approximately 100 stakeholders, sharing their personal and professional reflections on what they would like to see in the Strategy.</p>  <p>   The recently published School Age Childcare Regulations were informed by a working group which included sectoral representatives. </p>  <p>  As Minister I regularly speak at conferences where I also have the opportunity to be briefed on important concerns and developments.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the time my officials and I commit to engaging with the sector is both critical and valuable.  I believe that good engagement via a collaborative approach will assist us to tackle the many challenges and opportunities facing the early learning and care sector in Ireland. We are committed to  continuing to develop ways to most effectively engage with stakeholders. </p></reply>

The Control of Dogs Regulations set out further requirements in respect of owners of 10 specific breeds.  The aim of these specific control requirements for certain breeds is to provide a balanced and workable arrangement which prioritises the protection of society while also recognising the rights of dog owners.  </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to examine the requirements in relation to restricted breeds in order to ensure that safe and fair arrangements remain in place and are strengthened if necessary.  I am aware of research that critically examines the current approach to the regulation of restricted breeds.  I am also aware of the view that some additional breeds may warrant inclusion on the list of restricted breeds. I have asked my officials to examine this matter, giving consideration to the range of views held.  This will involve examining the relevant legislation to ensure that existing laws and international best practice, as well as the views of stakeholders, are taken into account.   Any amendments to existing legislation will be dependent on the outcome of this review.  This work has commenced and will continue throughout 2019.</p></reply>

Since 2015, there has been an increase of over 163,000 in the number of people employed in regions outside of Dublin, surpassing the Government&rsquo;s target of 135,000 by 2020.  We are also seeing increased employment in the hospitality sector from the promotion of tourist attractions and investment in greenways and blueways. </p><p>My Department is in the process of compiling the Fourth Progress Report on the Action Plan for Rural Development, which will report on the delivery of measures in the second half of 2018. It is envisaged the report will be circulated to the Monitoring Committee which oversees the Action Plan in the first quarter of this year, for consideration and subsequent publication.</p></reply>

This register is maintained by the Adoption Authority, which is appointed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>Domestic adoptions are registered in the Adopted Children Register, by the General Register Office, on receipt of an adoption order made by the Adoption Authority. It is not necessary to amend this legislation as it already allows for registration of adoptions by same-sex male couples. The abridged adoption certificate, which appears identical to a birth certificate by displaying details of adopters as &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot;, will be updated by way of regulation to also include details of &quot;parent&quot;, to coincide with commencement of legislation that will provide for this on birth certificates.</p><p>Legal recognition of adoptions is provided for in the Adoption Act 2010 (as amended).  This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who has informed me of the following concerning adoptions by same-sex male couples.</p><p>The Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 was commenced on the 19<sup>th</sup>of October 2017. The primary purpose of the Act is to give effect to Article 42A (Children) of the Constitution, in so far as it relates to adoption. In particular, the Act provides for:</p><p>- The adoption of any child, regardless of the marital status of his/her parents.</p><p>- The Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Court, to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</p><p>- The Authority or the Court to ascertain the child&rsquo;s views and such views to be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</p><p>- The introduction of revised criteria for dispensing with consent, in the case of the adoption of children whose parents fails in their duty towards them.</p><p>- The adoption of a child by his or her step parent without the requirement for the child's other parent to adopt his or her own child.</p><p>- The provision for the joint adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples.</p><p>- The further adoption of a child who was previously adopted.</p><p>The Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 amends the Adoption Act 2010. Before the commencement of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 only a sole applicant or a married couple could apply to adopt a child under the Adoption Act 2010. On commencement of the Marriage Act 2015, a same sex married couple who were married in accordance with that Act automatically became eligible to apply to adopt a child.</p><p>Therefore, there are no plans to include provisions in civil registration legislation, including the proposed Civil Registration Bill 2019, that would extend additional provision in respect of such adoptions.</p></reply>

A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me very shortly.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pension is still intended to be a contributory pension, as exists in most developed countries, and that those who have contributed to the Social Insurance Fund would still build up pension rights through PRSI paid over the years.</p>  <p>  The scheme will be introduced by legislation, and the proposals will, I believe, be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In advance of this, on 23 January  2018, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated using an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of new HomeCaring periods.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  Following enactment of the necessary legislation at the end of 2018, reviews of c. 80,000 pensioners impacted has commenced, and given the numbers involved will take a number of months to complete.  As the reviews are processed, the pensioners involved will be notified of the outcome of their review, or asked to provide further information to allow the review to be concluded.  Where the review results in a rate increase, their weekly payment will be adjusted and arrears paid - backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner's 66th birthday if later.  Where an increase is not awarded, their personal rate of pension will remain unchanged.  Work on the reviews will continue until all identified pensioners have been notified of their review outcome.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Their rate of payment is now being formally reviewed under legislation recently enacted.  Given the number of pensioners involved in the review this is expected to take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  Those individuals who have an underlying entitlement to a state pension (contributory) but are currently beneficiaries of a higher rate increase for a qualified adult (IQA) payment on their spouse or partner&rsquo;s pension will also be included in the review.  This work will commence in Quarter 2, once primary state pension (contributory) claimants have been progressed.</p>  <p>  Where the outcome is that the person's state pension (contributory) is the highest rate payable, they will be transferred onto that higher rate payment without delay and they will receive arrears backdated to March 2018, or their 66th birthday if later.</p>  <p>  Where possible, my Department will use information already held to assist in the reviews.  For example, a deciding officer will consider awarding HomeCaring Periods where a person&rsquo;s gap in employment coincides directly with a period for which they received certain social welfare payment such as Child Benefit (for a child up to age 12) or Carers Allowance or Benefit.  Additional information will be requested in writing from pensioners in relation to unexplained gaps in their social insurance record if required to complete their review.  Information requests will also explain how to access my Department&rsquo;s on-line service to provide the relevant information.  On receipt of the requested information, their pension review will be carried out and they will be notified of the outcome in writing.</p>  <p>  If a pensioner does not qualify for a rate which exceeds their current weekly entitlement, they will continue to receive their existing payment.  No entitlement rates will be reduced as a result of this review.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me very shortly.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pension is still intended to be a contributory pension, as exists in most developed countries, and that those who have contributed to the Social Insurance Fund would still build up pension rights through PRSI paid over the years.</p>  <p>  In advance of this, on 23 January last, the Government agreed to allow pensioners, born on or after the 1st September 1946, affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, to have their state pension (contributory) entitlement calculated under an interim TCA (TCA2012).  This also provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or looking after individuals who needed increased levels of care.</p>  <p>  In late September, my Department commenced the examination and categorisation of around 79,000 individual social insurance records of pensioners identified for review.  Information letters have issued to these 79,000 pensioners to let them know that their social insurance record is being examined and what will now happen.  This number for review will increase weekly, as new non-maximum rate state pension (contributory) claims are awarded, and each of these pensioners will be communicated with by the Department.</p>  <p>  Legislation to facilitate this interim TCA and the application of HomeCaring Periods was enacted at the end of 2018.  This allows the Department to progress the reviews and that work has now begun.  The Department has recruited over 110 temporary staff members to expedite this work.  As the reviews are processed, the pensioners involved will be notified of the outcome of their review, or asked to provide further information to allow the review to be concluded.  Where the review results in a rate increase, their weekly payment will be adjusted and arrears paid - backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner's 66th birthday if later.  Where an increase is not awarded, their personal rate of pension will remain unchanged.  Given the numbers involved, it will take my Department a number of months to work through all the claim reviews.  Work on the reviews will continue until all identified pensioners have been notified of their review outcome.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Many of the provisions contained within the Directive will support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.  The Directive provides for a range of new requirements concerning governance, management standards in schemes, safekeeping of assets, the need for clear and relevant information to members, the removal of obstacles to cross-border provision of pension services and the facilitation of cross border transfer of schemes.  There are also provisions that will enhance the powers of the Pensions Authority for effective supervision of occupational pensions.</p>  <p>  The IORPS Directive was the result of almost three years of discussion and negotiation and came into force on 12 January 2017.  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II Directive.  This is a substantial Directive and preparation of regulations to transpose the Directive are at an advanced stage.  It is expected that transposition into Irish law will be achieved later this quarter.  This timeframe is in keeping with many other EU countries. It should be noted that from enquiries made, the Department is aware of only one country which has transposed the Directive to date.</p>  <p>  Codes of practice will also be issued by the Pensions Authority following approval of the Minister.  The codes will expand on requirements, policies and principles prescribed in the transposing regulations. They will explain in practical detail what the Authority will expect from trustees to demonstrate their commitment to serving the best interests of members, deferred members and other beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  To ensure that schemes are informed of their obligations under the Directive, the Pensions Authority will also undertake a communication campaign on the implementation of the Directive.  The Authority will engage and consult with industry stakeholders and trustees on implementation of the new regulatory regime and related codes of practice.  The emphasis of this engagement will be on providing sufficient support, time and information in order for industry and trustees to plan for and make the changes needed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning Acts, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Therefore, it is not intended to place a moratorium on applications for planning permission for wind farm developments as referred to pending the finalisation of the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines.</p></reply>

Some streams of funding are delivered directly from funding departments to local authorities, while others are routed through departmental agencies.  </p><p>Most of the funding sourced from Central Government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. </p><p>In 2017, total transfers of funding from all central government sources to local authorities exceeded &euro;2.6 billion. Additional detail on Central Government funding of local authorities is provided in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report, which is available at the following link:  </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>In addition to Local Property Tax allocations and Departmental Grants and Subsidies, local authorities derive income from local sources including commercial rates, and goods and services such as housing rents, environmental and other charges. It is a matter for each local authority as to how it can maximise income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. </p><p>My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges; however all funding issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation and competing priorities. </p><p>Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department provided just over &euro;2.6bn to local authorities in 2018.

The scheme was included by Kildare County Council in their 2017 bids under Measure 1 of the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2016-2018.  This measure provides for improvements to group water schemes in order to achieve compliance with the quality parameters of the Drinking Water Regulations.  In 2017 my Department's funding allocations under the programme included an allocation of &euro;89,490 for works to the scheme.  While no specific allocation was made in 2018 the scheme was eligible to receive funding from a retained reserve to support projects not included in the allocations.  In doing this my Department undertook to work with the Council with a view to there being a plan in place to ensure the satisfactory progression of works.   </p>  <p>  I understand that in 2018 Kildare County Council completed an options report on the scheme. This report was compiled by the Council to provide clarity on the best way forward for investment in the scheme.  A whole life cost (capital and operation) was used to make this assessment.    </p>  <p>  I understand the report showed that the best solution, from an economic and compliance point of view is for the scheme to interconnect to, and be taken in charge by, Irish Water.  The Irish Water supply would ensure that householders in the supply area for the scheme receive drinking water that is in compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations on a consistent long-term basis.  The least favourable option identified was to continue as a private group water scheme.  Under this option, the associated costs are considerably higher than for the other options and even with significant capital investment the scheme would still be considered vulnerable to non-compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations.  The water supplied by the scheme has a record of containing high levels of nitrates.   </p>  <p>  In October 2018 the Council wrote to the management of the scheme outlining the funding position and enclosing a copy of the options report.  The letter advised that funding was available to upgrade the scheme to the standard required by Irish Water in order to take the scheme in charge.  I am advised that officials from Kildare County Council met with the scheme on 10 January 2019.   </p>  <p>  Funding is not an impediment to a solution that is sustainable and cost effective in the long-term. Funding was available under the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2016-2018 for an agreed sustainable and economic long-term solution.  Funding for such an approach remains available under the 2019-2021 cycle of the funding programme.</p></reply>

In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually. The measure applies to new and existing tenancies. This means that it applies when rents are set at the start of a tenancy and when rents are set in a rent review during an ongoing tenancy or new tenancy, unless otherwise exempted. An area may be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone for up to three years.  The designation of an area may be lifted earlier than this if the pressures on rent levels are deemed to have eased. The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. </p><p>A Rent Pressure Zone calculator is available on the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) website at: , to assist landlords and tenants in determining if their dwelling is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to calculate the maximum rent amount permitted for their dwelling.</p><p>The first rent review in relation to a property in a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) can only take place 24 months after the time that the tenancy was established or the time that the rent was last set. Thereafter, rent reviews can take place annually.  The existing requirement that the rent set is not above the local market rents for similar properties still applies in designated Rent Pressure Zones. The landlord must also provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this. In addition, in the case of a tenancy of a dwelling in an RPZ, a landlord must, at the commencement of the tenancy, furnish the tenant with details of the amount of the previous rent for the dwelling and the date it was set.</p><p>Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the RTB where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent or, if applicable, does not comply with the Rent Predictability Measure.  </p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2018 was published on 19 December 2018 to deliver on a number of commitments flowing from Rebuilding Ireland and commitments made in September 2017 to provide powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with the rent increase restriction in Rent Pressure Zones.</p><p>These key measures and reforms are designed to enhance enforcement powers for the RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the RPZ arrangements, and  will not only protect those who are renting but will also deliver greater stability and transparency to the rental sector.</p><p>This Bill will make it a criminal offence for landlords to implement rent increases that contravene the law, do not adhere to new definitions of a substantial change and fail to cooperate with an investigation or to register and update tenancies with the RTB.  It will allow the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.</p></reply>

Currently, based on CSO statistics, 98% of all new dwellings are built to an A3 rated BER standard. </p><p>The Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) performance for new dwellings will be typically equivalent to a BER of A2. </p><p>The draft regulations and accompanying technical guidance to implement this have now completed public consultation and the regulations are expected to be signed into law shortly.  Accordingly the A2 performance requirement is not currently in place. Transitional arrangements will apply when these regulations are implemented. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all new buildings to be NZEB by 31 December 2020 and all new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities to be NZEB after 31 December 2018.</p><p>COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2016/1318 of 29 July 2016, on guidelines for the promotion of nearly zero-energy buildings and best practices to ensure that, by 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings, advises the following:  &ldquo;Experience from the construction sector shows that the timing of the end of construction or completion of a building might be uncertain and may suffer delays. Member States would need to factor in the period of validity of building permits, the length of construction and completion of building works&rdquo;. This recommendation is available at the following link;</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>With regards to new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities, in December 2016 my Department issued a letter to all public service bodies advising them of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requirement for all new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities to achieve NZEB performance after 31 December 2018.  It was accompanied by specifications and guidelines on how this could be achieved in practice, and to apply to all buildings owned and occupied by public authorities commencing design from 1 January 2017. A workshop was held with approximately 200 representatives of the public sector in January 2017 to review these specifications and they were then made available on the website of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires that new Buildings owned and occupied by public authorities are NZEB. Normally it is not expected that a leased building will be owned by a public authority but the final decision on this will rest with the Public Authority.</p><p>The implementation of the NZEB requirement in public buildings is the responsibility of the relevant bodies and at this early stage, data is not available on the percentage of NZEB in place in the public sector. However, apart from dwellings, it should be noted that all other buildings, public and private, which commence construction after 1 Jan 2019 must be NZEB under Part L of the Building Regulations and compliance in this regard is monitored and enforced under Building Control Regulations. It is planned to introduce NZEB for dwellings in the coming months.</p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.  This applies to all buildings, including those owned and occupied by public authorities.  </p><p>Having regard to the above, I am satisfied regarding the State's compliance with relevant requirements and the associated guidance of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that this is an internal Departmental management report detailing sensitive operational matters with security implications and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</p></reply>

NMS is assisted in this task by, inter alia, members of the public and the third-level education sector who provide notifications of potential new archaeological sites. The content of the Sites and Monuments Record is presented digitally, and is available to the public, through the Historic Environment Viewer, maintained by NMS.  Monuments on the Sites and Monuments Record are also featured in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's LPIS and IFORIS land mapping systems and are part of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In this way up to date information on all known archaeological sites and monuments, including new discoveries, is widely available and readily accessible to all interested parties. </p>  <p>  The Record of Monuments and Places compiled under the National Monuments Acts affords automatic statutory protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State. Anyone proposing works in relation to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months&rsquo; advance notice of such work. The Acts also allow me to place a Preservation Order on any other important archaeological sites or monuments that may be at risk, including mew discoveries. My Department records and investigates all reports of damage or threats to archaeological features, including referring them to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and prosecution where appropriate.    </p>  <p>  Archaeological excavations are regulated under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. All excavation licences are issued on the basis that the investigations are for the purpose of searching for archaeological features and to provide for their subsequent recording or protection. A standard licence condition requires a report to be submitted to my Department on the results of each investigation.</p>  <p>  My Department also liaises regularly with the utility and infrastructure providers and has agreed codes of practice in place with a number of these agencies, including Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB Networks, aimed at safeguarding archaeological sites and monuments. In addition, there are programmes with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and farm organisations with the aim of raising archaeological awareness within the farming community which is the principal custodian of our archaeological heritage.</p></reply>
