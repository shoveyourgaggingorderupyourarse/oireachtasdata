BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or has indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.There may be a choice of operators offering this service in the area referred to and further information in this regard is available at <i>www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services</i>.</p><p>Telecommunications service providers are regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) which operates independently of this Department. The telecommunications regulatory framework, which ComReg implements, requires each telecommunications services provider to establish and operate a code of practice, including requirements for complaint handling. Service Providers must implement these measures, at a minimum, to assist consumers (including businesses) when they need to contact them with a complaint. A copy of the code of practice, which includes the three ways in which consumers can contact service providers, can be accessed at: <i></i>.</p></reply>

Therefore, all appointments must be booked in advance. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is working with their providers to see how they can increase capacity while adhering to the return to work protocol. Options under consideration include extended opening hours, overtime and protective segregation barriers between booths. </p>  <p>  Currently, people under the age of 70 and those that do not need to provide any supporting documentation, can apply for a learner permit and/or a driving licence online provided they have a Public Services Card and a verified MyGovID account. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is working to expand the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit application types in a manner that does not undermine the existing legal framework or the effective operations of the stakeholders involved.</p></reply>

EU Directive 2302/2015 on Package Travel applies to travel agents and tour operators, and it requires them to provide a full cash refund within 14 days in the event that a package holiday is cancelled, by either the customer or the holiday provider, due to &quot;unavoidable or extraordinary circumstances.&quot;  In cases where a package holiday has been booked with an Irish licensed travel agent, the person should seek advice and resolution through the travel agent, in the first instance.If that avenue proves problematic then the matter should be referred to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission at <i>www.ccpc.ie</i>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-23a.38.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300074#WRB02937"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 52 together.</p>  <p>  In cases where a package holiday to a non-Green list country has been booked with an Irish licensed travel agent, the consumer can seek refund under the EU Package Travel Directive 2302 due to "unavoidable or extraordinary circumstances."  That should be sought from the travel agent, in the first instance.  Such a refund must be made within 14 days.  Where a flight has been booked directly with an airline, the relevant legal protections are different and fall under EU Regulation 261, which covers the rights of airline passengers in instances of flight cancellations.  Under that Regulation, an airline has 7 days to make a cash refund to its customers when it cancels a flight.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law, irrespective of the circumstances.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines have waived flight change fees in circumstances where a flight occurs and people are not able to present because of Government advice, although fare differences and date restrictions may apply.  </p>  <p>  Evidently, the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions for countries that are not on the 'Green' list.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  </p>  <p>  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be workable for customers in all instances.  My colleague the Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton continues to engage with the airlines in respect to consumer rights issues, with calls for the airlines to offer fair and reasonable alternatives to passengers who wish not to travel at this time. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that there is no mechanism to compel airlines to cancel planned flights or to provide refunds or specific alternatives to refunds when there is no legal requirement to do so.</p></reply>

As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contractual arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.  The total PSO and Local Link budget originally allocated for 2020 was approximately &euro;300 million and assumed at the very least a 2-3% increase in passenger revenue over the year.  However, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound and swift shock to the public transport sector.  </p><p>Public transport&rsquo;s designation as an essential service throughout the pandemic means that, although fare revenues have collapsed, most of the cost of operations remains and must continue to be met in order to fulfil Government&rsquo;s broader policy objectives.  My Department began consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform from the beginning of April and, with their agreement, were able to draw down PSO funding ahead of what was profiled.  </p><p>Estimates in early June suggested that continuing to fund the existing PSO system, including the cost of additional cleaning measures and adding extra services where possible,<b></b>could require up to an additional &euro;460m to year end, depending on the level of easement of social distancing measures as the phases of the Roadmap progressed.Government approval in June to enable considerable additional expenditure on PSO has provided much needed financial assurance that enables continuation of the normal and essential PSO services.</p><p>For future years, as the Deputy is aware the Exchequer allocation for PSO public transport services is subject to the annual Budgetary process.  I am engaging regularly with Ministerial colleagues as Budget 2021 is prepared, and PSO subvention is one relevant area of expenditure which forms part of this engagement.  Discussions on Budget 2022 will take place next year.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the PSO is a large expenditure area, and one which requires careful scrutiny to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money in respect of the services delivered given the considerable expenditure incurred.</p></reply>

The covid crisis has changed the picture fundamentally however. There is still a huge amount of uncertainty on how long the pandemic will last and when aviation might be able to make a meaningful recovery- most industry analysts do not expect a return to pre-covid traffic level until 2023/4. </p>  <p>  In this context, it seems more appropriate to take a shorter term view - to examine how the aviation sector and regional connectivity can be supported while travel remains restricted and how we can assist the sector to recover once restrictions are eased. This is the approach which was advocated by the Aviation Recovery Task Force.  The recommendations of the Task Force are being examined by Government and relevant Departments who consult regularly with sectoral stakeholders via standing bodies such as the National Civil Aviation Development Forum,  as well as via informal channels.  This examination of the Task Force recommendations includes work on further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity. Work is underway to develop these recommendations into effective interventions and this will feed in to Government&rsquo;s further plans to aid broader economic recovery, including in the aviation sector, when conditions allow.</p></reply>

In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both public service obligation (PSO) and commercial transport operators.  </p>  <p>  The NTA has informed me that since Phase 2 of the Government&rsquo;s Re-opening Roadmap commenced on 8 June last, Dublin Bus has reverted to a full timetable with some limited exceptions at peak times where demand has remained low on certain routes.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Go-Ahead Ireland PSO bus services returned to a full time-table on the same date and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann returned to a full time-table on the 31st August.</p>  <p>  From 8 June to 28 June passenger carrying capacity on buses was severely restricted due to social distancing measures in place at the time which meant vehicle capacity was limited to approximate 20% of pre-Covid levels.  Since Phase 3 of the Re-opening Roadmap commenced on Monday 29th June, and coupled with the announcement by Government and legislation effective from Monday 13th July, that face coverings must now be worn on board public transport, the capacity of public transport was revised upwards to approximately 50% of pre-Covid-19 levels.  </p>  <p>  The newly announced Living with Covid Plan sets out clear capacity guidance for the 5 levels of the Plan. </p>  <p>  The NTA will continue to work with public transport operators to monitor demand against capacity and where issues arise and where spare fleet and drivers are available, additional services will be provided.</p></reply>

The decision was arrived at after careful deliberation and based on a number of factors including -</p><p>- Availability of PSO network services in the Dublin area, and in the vicinity of Tallaght, Ballinteer and Greenhills;</p><p>- Low passenger usage on some contracted services;</p><p>- Value for money for the delivery of the services; and</p><p>- Strategic fit in relation to the existing and proposed bus network.</p><p>In response to this decision by Dublin Bus, the NTA has put in place arrangements to augment PSO bus services where necessary to cater for the schoolchildren. The NTA, in conjunction with transport operators, is monitoring the impact of the return of schools on bus services generally.

The goal of the SBCI is to increase the availability of appropriately priced, flexible funding to viable Irish SMEs. The SBCI&rsquo;s role is to provide and promote the provision of credit to SMEs. The SBCI do not engage in direct lending, rather they work through on-lending partners to provide both loans and liquidity to support SMEs. The SBCI has a number of loan products available to assist SMEs through the current crisis, including the Future Growth Loan Scheme, the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p>  <p>  Last March, in response to the Covid-19 crisis, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) and its members announced a 3-month payment break would be made available for their customers, including SMEs. Following the initial payment break a further 3-month extension was announced by BPFI. As such, the Deputy should note that these payment breaks were introduced on a voluntary basis and were not done so on a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  The SBCI engaged in a dialogue with the banks offering SBCI supported loan products (the Future Growth Loan Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Covid-19 Working Capital Loan Scheme). The SBCI agreed with the banks offering these loans that payment breaks can be granted on these loans, however, the decision to offer a payment break on an individual loan is the decision of the lender involved. </p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p><p>This measure is designed to stimulate supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home. In order to further meet these goals, I announced a temporary enhancement to the existing HTB scheme for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus package. The legislation to give effect to this is et out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020 .</p><p>In summary, the legislation provides that where applicants:</p><p>(I) enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or apartment, or </p><p>(ii) make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build property,</p><p>during the period from 23 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, they will be eligible for increased relief under the HTB scheme to the lesser of: </p><p>- &euro;30,000 (increased from &euro;20,000), </p><p>- 10 per cent (increased from 5 per cent) of either the purchase price of the new home or, in the case of self builds, the completion value of the property, or, </p><p>- the amount of Income Tax and DIRT paid in the four years prior to making the application.</p><p>All other conditions of the original HTB scheme remains the same. </p><p>The enhanced level of support under the scheme, which was announced as part of the July Stimulus Package, applies to applicants who, on or after 23 July 2020 (and up to 31 December 2020), enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or who make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build.  </p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question as to whether consideration was given to back-dating the scheme to include all HTB applicants since March last; the position is that the Government decided, and the Oireachtas endorsed in passing the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020, that the threshold date for eligibility for the enhanced level of support was 23 July 2020. The approach adopted, whereby the date of the announcement was the same as the effective date (for the enhanced level of support), mirrored that which applied when the HTB scheme was originally introduced on 19 July 2016. The reason for this was to avoid potential market disruption in the period between the date of the announcement of the measure and any alternative effective date for the change. It is also the case that the back-dating of the measure would not have had any incentive effect.</p></reply>

The TWSS has now been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which was legislated for under the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS arrangement are separate and distinct from the TWSS.  Furthermore, the EWSS provides payments to employers rather than employees which is different to the TWSS where in excess of 80% of employees regularly received a top-up additional payment from their employers.</p>  <p>  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim a EWSS subsidy in respect of that employee. In effect, the EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 gross wages per week, the level of subsidy is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is paid for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 gross or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the EWSS.  Essentially, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned, subject, of course, to the employer paying the requisite amount of gross wages to an employee, as outlined above, in order to qualify for subsidy in relation to the employee.</p></reply>

However, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance.  What is needed is for the ongoing reform measures to be implemented and to quickly bear fruit.  In this regard, the new Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers including small businesses such as those in the leisure sector as well as in the various community groupings and facilities throughout the country.  This cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which I believe builds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, is a priority for this Government and in particular for my Department.  </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing insurance premiums for small businesses, particularly those in the leisure sector, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the executive board of the Judicial Council during Quarter 4.  The guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts. Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members. I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and as noted above this is reflected in the Programme for Government.  This is an issue I, as Minister for Finance, along with my Departmental colleague, Minister of State Fleming, will focus on.  In doing so we will be cooperating with our Ministerial colleagues that will be participating in the proposed  sub group of Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment in terms of prioritising delivery on the commitments to continuing insurance reform.</p></reply>

NAMA regularly assesses the feasibility of these sites and, where development is deemed commercially viable; NAMA provides funding for the delivery of new residential units on the sites. </p><p>I am advised that, to date, NAMA has directly facilitated in excess of 12,000 units on residential sites secured to NAMA and a further 5,600 units have been built on sites which benefitted from NAMA funding which were subsequently sold by NAMA debtors and receivers.  Sites with a delivery capacity of 11,000 units are at the pre-planning or feasibility stages; these sites are either not commercially viable at current sales prices and/or have specific infrastructural requirements such as roads, water or sewerage that will need to be addressed by local authorities and other State bodies before a planning application can be lodged. Further information on NAMA&rsquo;s residential delivery programme is available in NAMA&rsquo;s 2019 Annual Report (). </p><p>I wish to highlight that all NAMA-funded residential developments are subject to Part V planning requirements whereby 10% of the development must be provided to local authorities for social housing. Supplementary to this, NAMA continues to review its secured portfolio in order to deliver properties for social housing purposes (albeit at a lesser level than in previous years given the reduced portfolio size). The main method of social housing delivery is by way of direct sale (by a NAMA debtor or receiver) to a local authority or an approved housing body (AHB), or alternatively, by sale to NARPS (a NAMA Group entity) for onward long-term lease to an AHB. To date, over half of properties delivered by NAMA for social housing purposes have been provided via NARPS. In total 2,614 properties have been delivered by NAMA for social housing purposes. It is important to note, that this is in addition to properties provided by way of Part V compliance by debtors and receivers. </p><p>I am advised that close to 100% of all secured housing units are occupied as there are currently less than 50 habitable vacant residential units within NAMA&rsquo;s secured portfolio, excluding properties which are on the market or sale agreed. NAMA is currently working with its debtors and receivers regarding appropriate strategies for these units, which includes assessing the suitability of the units for social housing.</p><p>It is important to note that NAMA&rsquo;s debtors have the right to maximise the sales value of properties securing their loans so as to enable them to maximise their debt repayments. NAMA cannot require a debtor to take action which would reduce his/her repayment capacity, such as the sale of property at less than its market value.</p></reply>

The Indecon report also demonstrates that there is a higher number of branches per capita in many of the counties where a significant percentage of the population resides in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An Post offers counter services for AIB and Ulster Bank, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. An alternative method for cash withdrawal is cashback. Ireland is one of only 11 EU Member States in which cashback is common practice, and retailers do not charge consumers for availing of the service.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the banking sector is experiencing a challenging operating environment and the traditional banking model has been under pressure for some years to adapt and deal with legacy issues. Nevertheless, officials from my Department are in regular contact with the banks in which the State has a shareholding and all are investing across all channels to improve customer experience and continue to invest significantly in their IT systems and online services.</p>  <p>  At this point, the question of introducing a Public Service Obligation to help ensure the retention or provision of basic financial services in rural towns and villages would have to be carefully considered as it may not represent good value for money. </p></reply>

Revenue, who have ongoing contact with my officials, DMTACS, Screen Ireland and industry representatives on matters relating to the section 481 film credit, have advised that they are not aware of any film projects that have subsequently been abandoned. A number of projects recommenced production over the last few weeks and many others are currently preparing to recommence.</p><p>Since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, my officials have worked closely with DMTACS, Revenue and Screen Ireland in order to support the film industry to continue or recommence production and ultimately to complete film projects.</p><p>While the process of film production is now more complex, there has never been a greater requirement for audio-visual content, spurred by entertainment needs during a period of global restrictions.  Therefore, the focus of support is towards the completion of projects to help the Irish film industry access that marketplace. Measures taken by DMTACS, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland have focused on:</p><p>- bringing forward the payment of grants awarded this year to ensure financial commitments can be met and waiving eligibility requirements which no longer apply due to the COVID-19 crisis; and</p><p>- initiatives to support artistic and creative life during the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Details of supports available for the arts sector may found at the following link:</p><p>Additionally, the section 481 film credit is designed to support both short and long-form projects which means there is latitude for projects that take time or are suspended and completed at a later date. There is no penalty for necessary and reasonable delays such as those currently being experienced in the industry.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question on guidance for the treatment of Covid-related costs, as of Finance Act 2018, the film tax credit has operated on a self-assessment basis. In consideration of this, there is detailed guidance available on the Revenue website on the criteria to be applied when assessing the qualification of costs under section 481.  </p><p>All qualifying expenditure that is wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred to produce a qualifying film in the State can form part of the eligible expenditure used to calculate the credit. This includes the necessary additional health and safety costs required to continue a production due to Covid-19</p><p>Self-assessment requires producer companies to consider and apply the criteria to the circumstances of their own productions using the existing guidance.  In preparation for recommencement of productions in Ireland, there has been ongoing dialogue between Revenue and representatives of the film industry on specific examples of additional expenditure required to manage a production due to Covid-19.</p></reply>

The need to resolve the multiple serious structural issues the building has currently.  (A conservation project of considerable proportions would have to be planned and executed before any long-term plans for future visitor access can be developed.)  </p>  <p>  2.  The need to design a visitor management solution to get safe access to the interior of what is an extremely cramped and confined space in a way that is sustainable and enjoyable for visitors.  (In this regard, it should be noted that the Gate can only admit a limited number of people at any one time and is unlikely therefore to be a high visitor volume proposition.)</p>  <p>  The conservation works needed to rectify the fabric issues are the most immediate issue and planning for this is ongoing as quickly as feasible within the OPW's resource constraints.  Although a structural report has been prepared which indicates clearly the problems that have to be addressed, no cost estimates have  as yet been developed however.   The bulk of the work on projects such as this would, in any event, be carried out by the OPW's own skilled directly-employed labour force, so the additional project expenses can be expected to cost relatively less.</p>  <p>  In regard to the visitor proposition, it is at this stage not clear that the OPW would be in a position to operate the site itself and it may be the case that another locally-based community presentation model, such as that developed at Carlingford Castle most recently, may be suitable. The OPW has engaged with the Local Authority to see if this is feasible but no solutions have yet emerged.</p></reply>

I recently met with the National Campaign for the Arts and separately with the Events Industry Alliance, and heard first hand their concerns.</p><p>I recently announced the establishment of a new Taskforce for the recovery of the Arts and Culture sector under the Chair of Clare Duignan. The Taskforce, which met for the first time yesterday, will prepare a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>The sector includes culture, the arts, the audio-visual industry and the live entertainment industry with the Events Industry Alliance having two representatives on the taskforce.  The Taskforce will:-</p><p>-  adopt a solution-focused approach;</p><p>-  seek sector-specific expert input and consult with stakeholders;</p><p>-  invite additional individuals or expertise to attend meetings on an ad hoc basis, as it deems necessary;</p><p>-  focus on providing intelligence and recommendations for an expected on-going and varying impact of COVID-19 restrictions;</p><p>-  identify immediate and medium term goals for recovery and sustainability in the sector;</p><p>-  identify possible policy initiatives or impediments to a robust sustainable recovery in the sector;</p><p>-  recommend whole of Government policy initiatives and actions to support the sector;</p><p>-  prepare a report by the 31 October 2020 in order to provide the Government with an action-plan for the sector. </p><p>Membership of Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force includes:</p><p>-  Clare Duignan (Chair)</p><p>-  Arts Council</p><p>-  Business to Arts</p><p>-  Council of the National Cultural Institutions</p><p>-  County and City Management Association (CCMA)</p><p>-  Department of Health</p><p>-  Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht</p><p>-  Department of Social Protection</p><p>-  Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta</p><p>-  Events Industry Alliance</p><p>-  Irish Congress of Trade Unions</p><p>-  National Campaign for the Arts</p><p>-  Irish Music Rights Organisation</p><p>-  Irish Theatre Institute</p><p>-  Screen Ireland</p><p>-  Screen Producers Ireland</p><p>-  Denise Chaila</p><p>-  Martin Hayes</p><p>I am also very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing live performance promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view.  I was pleased to have recently announced a new fund that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians, creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance.</p><p>An allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; under my Department which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. This scheme is open to applications until 1pm on the 25th September and I hope to announce the recipients of this funding in the coming weeks.</p><p>A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.</p><p>The music support schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p></reply>

These arrangements for display are matters in the first instance for the Boards and management of the institutional holders.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reaffirms the Government's commitment to a &euro;460m programme of capital investment in our National Cultural Institutions (NCIs).  Work already completed at the National Library of Ireland has seen an important part of the national collection stored under improved conditions.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with the NCIs on the implementation of this programme of works.</p></reply>

Strategic Government investment is provided to Screen Ireland whose statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland. It supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland introduced a number of stimulus measures to support the sector in response to the effects of COVID19. These new measures included practical supports and were designed to aid production companies and creative talent in developing a strong slate of quality projects, so that the industry can emerge from the current situation in a position to scale up production activity. Over the past number of years, the Department has continued to increase the level of support provided to Screen Ireland, allocating &euro;17.2million in capital funding to Screen Ireland for 2020. In  July 2020, as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, I announced additional supports for the sector to be administered through Screen Ireland, including &euro;5 million to form a pilot &euro;10 million Performance and Production Support Package fund; a further &euro;2 million for the next round of the Sound and Vision fund which is administered through the BAI and a new &euro;3 million TV Drama Fund administered by Screen Ireland which will support the production of new Irish TV drama content in line with the Government&rsquo;s Audiovisual Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Audiovisual Action Plan under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme is designed to deliver on ambitions to make Ireland a leader in the audiovisual sector. A number of important recommendations in the Plan have already been delivered upon. While I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Budgetary process, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue work with stakeholders to implement the Plan and offer continued support to the Irish production sector.</p></reply>

We are also required to monitor their populations and report to the European Commission on their conservation status. A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both species since 2009. The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in April 2019 and is available on the NPWS website (<i></i>).</p><p>The latest population estimates available to my Department indicate that there are approximately 8,000-10,000 grey seals and about 5,000 harbour seals in Ireland. These animals are spread around the Irish coast with the largest populations occurring along the west coast from the Blaskets in Co. Kerry to north Mayo and Donegal. Seals, and grey seals in particular, are wide ranging animals. The Irish animals are known to move between Scotland and north-west France. In turn, animals from the large seals populations in Scotland migrate into Irish waters to feed. There are over 100,000 grey seals in Scotland.</p><p>While seals are a protected species, my Department may issue licenses to cull individual problem seals, and affected persons can apply for such licenses. My Department has no plans to undertake a general cull of seals.</p><p>My Department has been in contact in the last year with fisherman interests from the south-west, including Dingle, on the question of seals. Five Section 42 license applications have been received to date this year. One of these - relating to an estuary in Sligo &ndash; was approved. One was refused as it related to the shooting of seals on the Blasket Islands, a Special Area of Conservation for seals. The remaining three applications were also from the South West &ndash; two in Kerry and one in Cork and involved shooting seals including from boats. There are concerns about this approach to seal management, given the potential safety concerns arising from using high-powered rifles on moving platforms. Nonetheless, my Department is examining the potential for a pilot scheme which would test this approach and determine its efficacy in protecting fishermen&rsquo;s catches. A decision on the remaining licences has been delayed until this pilot scheme can be advanced. Plans to initiate this scheme earlier in the year had to be postponed due to the pandemic.</p><p>My Department is also in discussion with the Marine Institute on approaches to managing seal-fishery interactions, including current inshore fishing practices and trends, seal predation on fish, seal behaviour and numbers, as well as the by-catch of seals in fishing gear and will continue to investigate these issues and potential solutions in partnership with the fishing industry.</p></reply>

If a household is homeless, and eligible for social housing, then the appropriate structure for their support will be determined by the relevant local authority having regard to their scheme of allocations. </p>  <p>  The cost of delivering additional social housing homes is largely dependent on a range of key variables, such as the specific needs of the household on the local authority waiting list and the location and size of property required and any additional wrap around services that might be required in particular cases. Therefore we do not hold the level of information required to provide the estimated cost of providing a non rental market home to each person on a homeless list.</p>  <p>  Local authorities do not focus on support for homeless households in isolation, and must balance the needs of all of those in their functional area. This includes having regard to time spent awaiting an allocation of housing for example. In working to provide a long term solution to the provision of housing in Ireland through increasing delivery, it is also of paramount importance that any action needs to consider short, medium and long-term solutions, harnessing the capacity of what is available while building the stock in parallel. It is for that reason that the Government takes a blended approach, recognising the need for wide toolkit of delivery mechanisms; accessing the immediate availability of existing properties through acquisition or leasing arrangements, with a particular focus on harnessing the capacity of vacant properties, while at the same time facilitating local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to significantly enhance their own build programmes.</p>  <p>   This includes support through accommodation sourced from the private sector, and this support structure cannot be discontinued as to do so would jeopardise the accommodation of tens of thousands of households for whom there is no immediate alternative. During the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 91,000 households received housing support across the range of non-state owned accommodation, including long-term leasing, HAP and RAS. This included continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes directly by LAs, it would have secured approximately 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Alternatively, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for each of those 91,000 households. </p>  <p>   While the objective is to provide immediate social housing support, and ensure that households have accommodation, the long term preference of a household to be accommodated in more traditional &ldquo;allocated&rdquo; setting can be accommodated through transfer lists. As we develop more Built, Acquired and long-term leased homes, the reliance on the private rented sector is reducing. Indeed by end 2018 there were almost 6,000 fewer tenancies supported through Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme or HAP than at end 2014, when the HAP scheme commenced.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, is developing policy options for supported housing/housing with care so that older people have a wider range of accommodation choices available to them in accordance with the principles of the joint policy statement, &quot;Housing Options for Our Ageing Population&quot;. This policy statement was published by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health on 27th February 2019. The policy statement is available on my Department's website at:</p><p>Flowing from the Policy Statement, an Inter-departmental/agency Implementation Group was established, including membership from the two Departments, the Health Service Executive, Local Authorities and other relevant stakeholders. </p><p>Action 4.5 of the policy statement outlines that the Implementation group will Introduce financial services and develop the provision of financial incentives to support older persons in both public and private housing to rightsize to more energy efficient and appropriate housing units. </p><p>A workshop with members of the Older People&rsquo;s Council and a number of key stakeholders from the financial sector in Ireland to look at the potential financial barriers faced by older people during the rightsizing process and to collaboratively propose solutions to these barriers will be held shortly and a report outlining the recommendations will be provided to the Implementation group for consideration.</p><p>Action 4.7 outlines that the Implementation group will establish methods to incentivise older people in public and private housing to rightsize to appropriately sized units, if they choose to do so. </p><p>Arising from this action, my Department, working with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, undertook a survey of mature homeowners in August 2019. The survey explored the housing circumstances and attitudes of households composed of homeowners aged 55+ with a view to generating policy relevant findings. A focus of the survey was the attitude of mature homeowners toward seeking housing better suited to their circumstances (typically, trading down) or to relocate from areas of high demand to lower demand. A research paper presenting the principal findings of the survey will be published shortly. Consideration of the findings and any potential incentives that may enable downsizing where people choose to do so will follow.</p><p>Further research that explores older people's perceptions and experiences of rightsizing in both public and private housing is being conducted by Age Friendly Ireland on behalf of the Implementation Group. This research will be provided to the Implementation Group for review at its next meeting. It is intended that the Implementation Group will provide its final report addressing each of the 40 actions assigned to it by end 2020.</p></reply>

A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-23a.233.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300076#WRD07200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 to 100, inclusive, together.</p><p>Given the critical lack of residential development, as an initiative of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is primarily designed to fund the provision of public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages and enable housing developments to be built on key sites at scale.</p><p>In 2018, 30 projects received final LIHAF approval with an overall budget of &euro;195.7m, of which &euro;146.8m will be Exchequer funded, with the remainder funded via local authorities.  Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although an element of the housing that was associated with the project has taken place.</p><p>Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description, cost reductions and projected housing delivery are available at <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF</i>.</p><p>The individual sales price of every home that is delivered following the construction of the LIHAF facilitating infrastructure is not available in my Department. However to provide indicative examples, in Cork City, the LIHAF project at Glanmire will see 110 homes delivered with a discount of approx. &euro;20,000 each on the open market price and in respect of the Oldtown/Mooretown project in Fingal, in addition to 10% social housing, the open market value of remaining units will have a cost reduction of &euro;2,500, plus 30 2-bed units are to be provided, with an open market value of &euro;290,000 or less.  I recently launched the construction phase of infrastructure in Adamstown where 2,000 homes will be delivered. Leveraging the LIHAF funding, approximately 40% of these homes will be sold at discounted price points.  In Adamstown this means 300 homes at under &euro;300k &amp;amp; 475 homes under &euro;320k</p><p>Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of August 2020 (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage and one is expected to have tender approval and go to construction before the end of Q4 2020.  Local authorities have indicated that work is progressing on the remainder.  My Department continues to support local authorities to progress projects to conclusion.</p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase.  This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end Q2 2020, with approximately &euro;45.103 million in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding bringing the total expenditure to &euro;60.137m). The table below details the exchequer funding drawn down up to end of Q2 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local   Authority</th>       <th>Project name  </th>       <th>Drawdown of LIHAF funding   Exchequer Contribution to end of Q2 2020 (&euro;)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare  </td>       <td>Claureen, Ennis  </td>       <td>157,919 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City  </td>       <td>Old Whitechurch Road  </td>       <td>6,300,843 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City  </td>       <td>South Docks  </td>       <td>1,396,506 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>Glanmire </td>       <td>490,751 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County  </td>       <td>Midleton (Water-rock)  </td>       <td>358,044 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County  </td>       <td>Carrigaline</td>       <td>450,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City  </td>       <td>Dodder Bridge  </td>       <td>473,487 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City  </td>       <td>Belmayne and Clongriffin  </td>       <td>325,710 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Cherrywood</td>       <td>2,910,825 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Woodbrook Shanganagh  </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Clay Farm  </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Donabate Distributor   Road</td>       <td>10,780,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Oldtown Mooretown  </td>       <td>4,020,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Baldoyle Stapolin  </td>       <td>274,561 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Naas  </td>       <td>470,190 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>390,556 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Sallins</td>       <td>654,584 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Ferrybank</td>       <td>318,387 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Western Environs  </td>       <td>4,768,118 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Mungret</td>       <td>2,102,213 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth  </td>       <td>Newtown Drogheda  </td>       <td>88,571 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth  </td>       <td>Mount Avenue Dundalk  </td>       <td>172,945 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath  </td>       <td>Ratoath</td>       <td>1,027,618 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath  </td>       <td>Farganstown, Navan  </td>       <td>2,779,435 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Kilcarbery/Corkagh Grange  </td>       <td>872,011 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Clonburris SDZ  </td>       <td>27,613 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Adamstown</td>       <td>1,523,353 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council  </td>       <td>Gracedieu</td>       <td>112,234 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council  </td>       <td>Kilbarry</td>       <td>1,773,583 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>Brawny Road, Athlone  </td>       <td>82,500 </td>    </tr> </table> In terms of homes delivered, the table below details the number of completed homes up to Q4 2019.

While staff in the unit that deals with the issuing of licenses continued  to attend the office during the crisis, given restrictions, the numbers of such staff attending was, of course, restricted.  The database system used for managing deer licensing is not currently a web based one and some technical challenges arose in facilitating the processing of such licenses for staff working remotely with laptops. Staff are working flat out to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that it has been suggested by individuals, hunting and farming bodies that I would extend licenses for the previous deer hunting season to allow hunters with such a license to hunt after 1 September with their previous licenses.  However, the provisions in the Wildlife Acts do not allow for the extension of deer hunting licences and licences for last season automatically expired under the law on 31 July this year.</p></reply>

It is a relief that there are no reported deaths or injuries, but the very sudden displacement of thousands of people has caused great suffering and created a major humanitarian emergency as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the COVID pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities have requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from our humanitarian logistics base in Brindisi, Italy. The Greek authorities have thanked us for our offer of assistance and we now stand ready to respond to a request for the deployment of emergency humanitarian supplies. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. </p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection in Greece, and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June. In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided to accept another group of four unaccompanied minors, as part of this overall commitment, and is continuing to keep under review what further actions it can take to meet the enormous humanitarian and relocation needs arising from this tragic event. </p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:</p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.</p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.</p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.</p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, it has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered.  At this juncture, no new information has come to light.</p></reply>

The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and completed all stages in that House in December 2019.    </p>  <p>  The overall approach is to move away from concentrating on reacting to problems in schools after they have given rise to grievances to an approach which aims to improve the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools. This will be done by setting out in law a framework that schools will apply in their engagement with students and parents. </p>  <p>  The Bill will require that every school must prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter. Every school's Charter must adhere to national guidelines which will be published after consultation with partners. </p>  <p>  I believe that the Bill constitutes an important step towards improving the experiences of both students and parents in their engagement with schools and intend to bring it forward to its next stages in the Dail at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  In relation to the numbers of persons employed by my Department with the qualification referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the Department has some 355 professional staff involved in the inspection of schools and the provision of psychological services who hold professional qualifications in relation to their disciplines.

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>Based on the public health advice published in early July, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7 August and from NPHET on 18 August, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity.  The planning to date is in accordance with the Government decision of 18th August, which set out that arrangements for school transport would proceed as planned for re-opening but the Minster for Education and Skills and the Minister for Health and other relevant Ministers will review measures, including any additional resources, to ensure the safe operation of school transport for secondary school children.</p>  <p>School Transport Scheme services commenced operation on 26 August 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity.</p>  <p>An assessment of the resources required to implement physical distancing on all post-primary services has been undertaken and, in line with the Government decision, the Department is reviewing this information in consultation with other relevant Departments  with a view to implementing the measures required to ensure the operation of school transport for post-primary children that is aligned to updated health advice received from NPHET on 18 of August. </p></reply>

This guidance was developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with education stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives.</p>  <p>  Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection, including physical distancing measures and reducing the risk of congregation of students. Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to implement these measures locally taking into account its individual circumstances such as school layout.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on the issue of heavy school bags. Actions consist of a range of measures, including the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>  <p>  The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing. While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home. Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum. </p>  <p>  It should be also be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the World Books online encyclopaedia resource, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The decision to use tablet devices, and as a consequence eBooks, is a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Where the introduction of new technology is planned, there should be consultation with members of the school community including parents. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  An advice sheet on the adoption of tablets in schools is available on the PDST-Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) website, detailing what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <i></i></p></reply>

This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, which forms part of the overall Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not proposed that there will be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework at least two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.</p></reply>

In the absence of established parameters for eligibility under an equivalent post graduate scheme to the undergraduate free fees initiative, baseline student numbers and the tuition fee costs of such a cohort of students it is not possible to accurately estimate the potential costs of such a scheme.</p><p>As the deputy will be aware the Programme for Government commits to develop a long-term sustainable funding model for higher level education.  The Minister has previously set out an intention to specifically examine student supports to ensure all students have access to educational opportunities and supports that will help them to fulfil their potential. Furthermore, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.</p><p><b>Restoring student grants to pre-2008 levels</b></p><p>It is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of the various adjustments that have been made to the student support system since 2008, particularly in light of the demographic changes that have taken place. </p><p>To put it in context, in 2008/09 there were 57,261 students who benefitted from grant support at a cost of &euro;264m, whereas in 2018/19 there were over 74,000 students in receipt of grant support at a cost of circa &euro;347m.</p><p>It is estimated, however that it would cost in excess of &euro;100m to reverse all of the adjustments that have been made to the student grant scheme since 2008. </p><p><b>Restoring support for guidance to pre-2008 levels</b></p><p>Measures announced by my Department as part of Budgets 2016, 2017 and 2018 mean that 500 of the 600 guidance posts that were withdrawn during the financial crises were restored to schools from September 2018.</p><p>This allocation is provided separately and transparently on each school's staffing schedule.  These posts have been ring-fenced so they can only be used for guidance activities and to meet the guidance needs of the school. </p><p>The Department has committed considerable resources towards the restoration of guidance counselling hours to post-primary schools, to the provision of CPD for guidance counsellors and to the provision of a national guidance counselling supervision service for post-primary guidance counsellors.</p><p>As part of the COVID-19 operational supports to schools for the 2020/21 school year, approximately 120 posts have been provided for guidance to support student wellbeing.

This guidance has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).  </p>  <p>  Government policy, which is based on official public health advice, is to avoid non &ndash; essential travel, other than to countries on the &lsquo;Green List&rsquo; where the advice is to take normal precautions.  </p>  <p>  It is a requirement for anyone coming into Ireland, from locations other than those with a rating of &lsquo;normal precautions&rsquo; (&ldquo;green&rdquo;), to restrict their movements for 14 days, and this includes school staff, parents and children or other students coming from abroad to attend school in Ireland.  Restricting your movements means staying indoors in one location and avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible. </p>  <p>  The school has a duty of care to all of its pupils and staff members. Where a person &ndash; staff member or pupil - has not observed the mandatory requirement to self-isolate for 14 days following return from a non-green list country, it is reasonable for the school to refuse access to the pupil or staff member for this period.</p>  <p>  The Department is in direct contact with these schools to provide assistance and guidance in implementing public health measures.</p></reply>

The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits.  It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to those for the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for the previous model of State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of the previous model of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) or Living Alone Allowance. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s best current estimate for the gross cost of reintroducing State Pension (Transition), on the same basis as it previously operated, is &euro;293 million for a full year.  It is expected that these costs would be offset somewhat by savings of &euro;166 million on Working Age Schemes, arising from recipients transferring from these schemes to State Pension (Transition), giving a net cost of &euro;127 million each year.  These figures are based on current payment rates.  This costing was calculated based on analysis of the observed ratio of State Pension (Transition) awards to State Pension (Contributory) awards for the period from 2009 to 2012, and projecting this forward in terms of estimated recipient numbers in coming years.  It should be noted that these costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revisions of the estimated numbers of recipients.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; commits to introducing a Retirement Payment for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseeker's Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.   I wish to assure the Deputy that I have made the introduction of the new Retirement Payment an immediate priority for my Department.  Officials in my Department are currently considering the design of the scheme and assessing the necessary legislation, ICT system requirements and administrative processes required to support the introduction of this payment.  The Programme for Government also states that the planned increase in the State Pension Age next year will be deferred and it will remain at 66 years.  Subject to Government approval, it is my intention to bring the necessary legislation for both of these initiatives before the Oireachtas later this year.    </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Firstly, the State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State Pension (Contributory) is not means-tested but is based on social insurance (PRSI) contributions and paid from the Social Insurance Fund, and as such it is important to ensure that those qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory) have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.</p><p>The introduction of a universal State pension paid at full rate to everyone of 65 years of age and over, regardless of their PRSI contributions or their means, would require fundamental reform of the State pension system, and perhaps to the entire model of social insurance.  It would give rise to a range of considerable policy and operational issues.  Examples include -</p><p>- the impact on customer behaviour with respect to work, work patterns, employment status, personal savings, contributions into the system in tax/PRSI, etc.;</p><p>- the interplay between the State pension system and occupational and private pensions and the scope of the State to support such arrangements;</p><p>- the applicability of such a pension to those in public service employments;</p><p>- the potential legal issues involved in different treatments of those with occupational pensions in the private and public sector and those with a mix; </p><p>- how such a system would work with existing EU pension and social security law and with international bilateral arrangements; and</p><p>- the treatment of retirees who are not resident in the State, but who have built up a contributory pension entitlement over the years that they worked here and paid PRSI.  </p><p>Given the various potential factors involved, estimating the costing of a universal State pension is challenging and would vary significantly depending on the specific design components.  However, it is clear that the cost would be very substantial.Based on preliminary assessments, officials in my Department expect that the <i>additional</i>cost over the cost of the existing State pension system could be over &euro;3 billion per annum and potentially substantially more depending on decisions with respect to some of the factors mentioned above.  </p><p>Clearly, this would be very expensive and would require either considerable additional revenues, or, if introduced on a cost-neutral basis, very significant diversion of funds from elsewhere.</p><p>The Deputy is aware that the public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.

Child benefit is currently paid, as of end-August 2020, to over 638,244 families in respect of over 1.2 million children.  The estimated expenditure on Child Benefit in 2019 is in excess of &euro;2 billion.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent data available from the Central Statistics Office, there were 391,233 children aged between 12-18 years in the state in 2019. The cost of a &euro;30 weekly increase per child in this age cohort is estimated at &euro;610.3 million per annum.  </p>  <p>  Increasing Child Benefit in this way is not considered a targeted measure and any change to Child Benefit involves significant cost implications, and therefore would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

This represents a considerable investment in supporting participants to acquire the necessary education and skills to re-enter the labour market. </p>  <p>  The weekly rate of payment is linked to the persons' underlying payment, for example jobseeker's allowance, and all budget increases in these rates are applied to Back to Education Allowance recipients. Any rate changes would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to that fact that the allowance has recently been extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19.  Ordinarily a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum period of time before pursuing training or education  This condition is now being waived for recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment seeking to return to education. This provides that those impacted by the pandemic have training and education options available to them for the upcoming academic year. </p>  <p>  If a person currently in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment wants to apply for Back to Education Allowance, they can now choose to apply for and transfer to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. Their rate of Back to Education Allowance  payment will be linked to their qualifying social welfare rate of payment. Whereas the pandemic unemployment payment is short term in nature and scheduled to cease at the end of March 2021, the Back to Education Allowance provides long term income support which can be provided for the duration of an education course and which can extend for up to 3 or 4 years depending on the individuals circumstances. </p>  <p>  There is also an annual Cost of Education Allowance of &euro;500 available to participants of the Back to Education Allowance scheme who have one or more dependent children.</p>  <p>  Any person in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and seeking to return to education should contact their Intreo Centre to discuss the options available to them including access the Back to Education Allowance.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

I know many employees who have been laid off are experiencing great uncertainty but in making this decision the Government had to consider the need to ensure businesses survive, which in turn ensures further permanent job losses are avoided as much as possible.</p>  <p>  While an employee may be temporarily laid off from their usual employment, there is no statutory provision in employment legislation which prohibits them from seeking alternative employment.   If an employee chooses to take up other employment during that temporary lay-off and they remain available to resume their employment with their usual employer, they have an entitlement to claim redundancy from that employer when this emergency measure ends.</p>  <p>  When the emergency measure ceases to have effect and the employee has not been taken back to work by their usual employer, they are entitled to claim redundancy from that employer.  Under existing provisions the employer can then either agree to the redundancy payment if they still have no work available to offer the employee, or the employer may within seven days of the employee&rsquo;s claim for redundancy, give a counter notice by offering the employee not less than 13 weeks unbroken employment (with no lay-off or short-time) starting within four weeks of the employee serving notice.</p>  <p>  If the employer does not fulfil the counter notice above and the lay-off or short-time persists the employee retains the right to claim redundancy from their employer.</p>  <p>  In situations where an employer offers to take the employee back to work from temporary lay-off to their job and the employee chooses not to return to that employment a redundancy situation does not arise and the employee does not have an entitlement to claim redundancy.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of increasing the Fuel Allowance by two weeks, from 28 to 30 weeks is &euro;18.3 million in a full year. </p>  <p>  2. As the current weekly rates of payment are in excess of 2008 levels, no additional costs would arise.  </p>  <p>  3. The estimated full year cost of increasing the weekly rate of the State Pension Contributory, Widow(er)&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension, Deserted Wife's Benefit (age over 66), Death Benefit Contributory Pension and State Pension Non-Contributory to &euro;260 per week is estimated at &euro;451.2 million. This costing includes proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment where relevant.</p>  <p>  4. The cost of a 110% Christmas Bonus payment is estimated to be circa &euro;322 million in 2020. </p>  <p>  5.

This costing includes proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment where relevant.</p>  <p>  6. The cost of increasing the Working Family Payment multiplier from 60% to 75% is estimated to be in the region of &euro;92.5 million in a full year. </p>  <p>  7. Child benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their 18th birthday when they are in full-time education, or if they have a disability.   It is estimated that the full year cost of extending the child benefit payment to 18 year olds in secondary level education is an additional &euro;58.3 million per year. </p>  <p>  8. The Department is not in a position to provide the cost of increasing the age of the youngest child to 18 years for receipt of One Parent Family Payment (OPF), without extensive analysis of the lone parent population which could potentially benefit from this provision. Firstly, this change could result in a cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible for a payment.  Secondly, some customers could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back to the OFP.  Again, it would be difficult to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes.  Finally, such a change to the scheme would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Working Family Payment (formerly FIS).  It is not possible to predict the impact on payments as a result of the interaction between both schemes without having detailed knowledge of individuals&rsquo; working patterns and the degree to which these might change. </p>  <p>  9. Based on 2020 recipient numbers, the annual cost of increasing the Back to School Clothing and Footwear rates by &euro;50 per child, from &euro;150 to &euro;200 per child in respect of children aged 4 to 11 and from &euro;275 to &euro;325 per child for children aged 12 years and over in second level education, is estimated at &euro;13.2 million.</p>  <p>  10. Each additional week of maternity benefit would cost approximately &euro;10.3m. To increase the duration of paid maternity leave from 26 weeks to 52 weeks would cost approximately &euro;267.8 million in a full year. It should also be noted that there are additional costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups for public/civil servants.</p>  <p>  These costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated numbers of recipients.</p></reply>

These three pillars are &ndash;</p>  <p>  (i) A high level Further and Higher Education Roadmap which provides an overview of the phased return to Further and Higher Education</p>  <p>  (ii) A Covid-19 Adaptation Framework which provides a structure, guidance and support for further  and higher education institutions and providers that does not end with re-opening. This is to assist them in consistently and collaboratively continuing to adapt to meeting the challenges posed by this pandemic.</p>  <p>(iii) Practical Guidance for Further and Higher Education for Returning to On-Site Activity in 2020. This guidance was prepared on a consultative basis with sector stakeholders and with the assistance of public health expertise. This guidance was published on July 22nd, and was supplemented by more detailed campus  specific implementation guidelines developed by public health experts within the Higher Education sector, published on 5 August. Implementation guidelines were developed by Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) and SOLAS for Further Education and Training Institutions and published on 11 August 2020.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID 19 emergency, the Further Education and Training (FET) sector demonstrated a swift and appropriate response making specific provision for learners engaged in their programmes and nearing completion of their awards, with adjusted teaching strategies and alternative assessments supporting learners remotely wherever possible. In some cases, where alternative assessment approaches could not be created without compromising the integrity of the award standard or where access to specialist equipment for the learner to complete assessments is necessary, ETB institutions communicated with these learners on the individual approaches being undertaken to enable them progress.</p>  <p>  All FET Institutions re-opened for staff on 31 August. Phased reopening for learners has been occurring throughout September with service delivery commencing on or before 29 September in all cases. </p>  <p>  FET institutions planned for returning to education and training taking a phased return of learners into consideration. Priority was given to learners awaiting assessment who have their course substantially completed, to those who require additional tuition and practical instruction in order to complete their FET programme and to continuing learners, before the enrolment of new learners.</p></reply>

This unique three-pillar approach was developed in close consultation with agencies, stakeholders, provider representative bodies and social partners.</p>  <p>  These guides have since been supplemented by Implementation Guidelines developed by experts within the higher education sector, and approved by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, published on August 5th.  These guidelines can be further updated and modified as the public health situation evolves.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop of Government, Departmental and sectoral guidance, Higher Education Institutions have been undertaking detailed planning and contingencies for re-opening and communicating these to students and learners as they move from emergency remote learning towards a mode of blended learning, combining both online and onsite provision. </p>  <p>  The balance between face to face and online learning will be different in each programme, and will depend on factors such as the teaching and learning needs of various disciplines, the size of student and learner groups and the practical/theoretical balance of learning outcomes.</p>  <p>  A robust model of outbreak management is being put in place, as a priority, by the higher education system across all universities and institutes of technology. This aims to safeguard students and staff and the communities in which they are located. </p>  <p>  Last week in the light of the deterioration in the COVID-19 situation in Dublin, following NPHET&rsquo;s request, Government asked that higher and further education institutions consider enhanced protective measures.</p>  <p>  In the light of this request, additional protections are being introduced which will see a more gradual reopening of higher and further education facilities in Dublin. Individual institutions have revised their plans and are communicating with students.</p>  <p>  It is not intended for my Department to review or approve the plans put in place by individual institutions. The diversity and flexibility of the Higher Education sector has been key in driving responsive and adaptable approaches to the challenges created by the pandemic. The guidance that has been provided is designed to allow HEIs to leverage that flexibility to adapt to a evolving situation, and change their approach in accordance with the latest health advice.</p></reply>

This national strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early-investigation and proactive high-visibility approach to assault reduction.

Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</p><p>The table below outlines the number of knives seized in Cork between January 2019 and December 2019. <table>    <tr>       <th>Cork City</th>       <th>Cork North</th>       <th>Cork West </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>160</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>255</td>    </tr> </table> <b></b>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has published a draft new Youth Justice Strategy in tandem with an online consultation, which has been completed recently.  The draft Strategy is currently being refined with reference to the outcome of the public consultation and the views of key stakeholders, with a view to presenting the finalised version to Government by the end of the year.</p><p>A key priority for this new Strategy will be to strengthen and expand the role of the Garda Youth Diversion projects and other community-based initiatives, including those working with the Probation Service.  Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime.</p></reply>

However, it is necessary to reduce footfall in order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole. </p>  <p>  Maternity hospitals have performed well during the pandemic and have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe.  The fact that there have been no Covid maternal deaths in this country,and that we have a had a low incidence in pregnant women, suggests that the current approach is working.</p>  <p>  However, we must remain vigilant as services resume and higher numbers of people attend hospitals. Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme is currently working on a document which will issue to all maternity services, seeking to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions in maternity  hospitals, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.  I am advised that the paper will issue over the coming week.</p></reply>

By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions, as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community.</p>  <p>  Following a delay in delivery from the manufacturer, the first deliveries of influenza vaccines for those in at-risk groups to all sites (GPs, pharmacists, nursing homes etc.) started on 17th September. For the initial deliveries, the quantities of influenza vaccine delivered to sites are the same as previous years. The quantities of vaccine available to order by sites will be increased in line with the amounts received into the country. All shipments, totalling 1.35 million individual doses, are expected to be delivered before the end of October.  The HSE is in daily contact with the manufacturer. The delivery of 600,000 doses of nasal vaccine to be used for children is not affected.</p>  <p>  The number of doses procured by the HSE is sufficient to vaccinate all in the at-risk groups. The start date of the vaccination programme will be late September or early October, the same as in previous years.  The vaccination programme for children is expected to commence from mid-October.</p>  <p>  The vaccination campaign will be accompanied by a comprehensive communications campaign to encourage the greatest possible take-up.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland with the exception of Dublin, is currently at At Level 2, the majority of areas of economy and society, for example: schools, restaurants, pubs and gyms, are open. The priority is to keep schools and childcare facilities open and minimise disruption in the work force.  It is intended that the public health measures at this level will be effective until 9th October, 2020.  The public health measure in respect of swimming pools at level 2 can be found at   </p><p>Dublin is currently at level 3. At level 3, the priority is to keep schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force. This means that a number of services will be moved online and some businesses will be closed (e.g. museums and other indoor cultural venues). Additional restrictions will apply to restaurants and pubs. People will also be required to reduce the number of people that they meet to a minimum and stay in their own region. These measures will remain in place until 9th October.  Under Level 3, gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools may remain open with protective measures, for individual training only. Further information on level 3 public health measures can be found at<i> </i></p><p>The relevant regulations as set out in S.I.

This was to allow for the increase in COVID-19 presentations to the hospital.  </p>  <p>  Since early June 2020 UHK, in line with other hospitals throughout the system, have gradually re-commenced services. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals, including UHK, are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity. </p>  <p>  The HSE have further advised that during this period Orthopaedic services at UHK have been extremely busy. The hospital&rsquo;s Orthopaedic trauma activity has increased, due not only to unscheduled trauma presentations, but also due to improved access to theatre arising from a lower rate of elective surgery. </p>  <p>  UHK management have confirmed that fractures are automatically seen and treated in UHK without delay at present. These patients are not re-directed to any other unit for treatment.</p>  <p>  In addition, UHK have advised my Department that while the Arthroplasty (Joint replacement) service was suspended during COVID-19 due to the increased risk to patients, this service recommenced in September with the assistance of the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee.</p>  <p>  At present it is expected that Arthroplasty services will recommence fully in UHK by the beginning of October 2020. Approval has been given to proceed to Design Stage 2(a) for the construction of a new dedicated Orthopaedic Clean-air theatre and associated developments. Orthopaedic surgeons and nursing staff are part of this design team for this project.</p></reply>

The resumption of clinical placements is also essential in terms of ensuring the continuation of a sustainable workforce into the future.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy was advised by the Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in his reply on 16 September, guidance on the resumption of clinical placements was issued by the Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE to all Higher Education Institutes and copied to healthcare providers. This guidance included a revised version (dated 17 August 2020) of the HSE's document - Infection Prevention and Control Requirements for Clinical Placements in HSE facilities in the context of COVID-19. This document, among other things, sets out the requirement for Infection Prevention and Control Training for all students. It also underlines that clinical placements are an essential part of students' education and training, ensuring that they will continue to receive the breath of clinical experience that they require.  </p>  <p>  According to this guidance, students can move from a placement in one setting to a placement in another without an interval of time, provided they complete a COVID-19 Healthcare Worker Relocation Self Risk Assessment prior to commencing in a different location. Similarly, if a student continues part-time work in a healthcare setting during the same period as attending clinical placements, they are required to complete this self-assessment on an ongoing basis so that any need for testing may be identified. The guidance makes it clear that students should not present on clinical placement if they have any symptoms of acute infection. Overall, the guidance facilitates students in completing their education and training and in doing so it does not preclude them from working part time so long as they adhere to the infection prevention and control requirements.</p></reply>

My Department has worked with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) to provide guidance to allow for the resumption of the safe provision of routine care. The HPSC advises that regular PPE, which has always been used, is generally sufficient for routine dentistry. This is supported by the Dental Council which has indicated that dentists must take a case by case assessment when deciding if additional PPE is warranted. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. </p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), which currently provides a range of dental treatments to medical card holders will need to be revised in order to align it with modern evidence on oral health needs and provision of dental services. My Department is committed to reviewing the provision of dental care for those eligible for public services and will engage with representatives of the dental profession in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the delays in accessing some services provided by the HSE, caused in part by the necessary concentration of resources at managing the current COVID-19 pandemic.  However, I understand that the HSE expect most services to return to normal in due course.</p></reply>

This was to allow for the increase in COVID-19 presentations to the hospital.  </p>  <p>  Since early June 2020 UHK, in line with other hospitals throughout the system, have gradually re-commenced services. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals, including UHK, are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity. </p>  <p>  The HSE have further advised that during this period Orthopaedic services at UHK have been extremely busy. The hospital&rsquo;s Orthopaedic trauma activity has increased, due not only to unscheduled trauma presentations, but also due to improved access to theatre arising from a lower rate of elective surgery. </p>  <p>  UHK management have confirmed that fractures are automatically seen and treated in UHK without delay at present. These patients are not re-directed to any other unit for treatment.</p>  <p>  In addition, UHK have advised my Department that while the Arthroplasty (Joint replacement) service was suspended during COVID-19 due to the increased risk to patients, this service recommenced in September with the assistance of the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee. </p>  <p>  At present it is expected that Arthroplasty services will recommence fully in UHK by the beginning of October 2020. Approval has been given to proceed to Design Stage 2(a) for the construction of a new dedicated Orthopaedic Clean-air theatre and associated developments. Orthopaedic surgeons and nursing staff are part of this design team for this project.</p></reply>

This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of measures that can be taken to reduce risk. </p><p>As with any procedure or test, there will be a cost. As Minister for Health, I do not have any responsibility for private hospitals, including in relation to charges that they apply to their patients. Additionally, I cannot direct health insurers in how they provide their products and services, or indeed how they choose to reimburse their customers for costs relating to healthcare procedures. Private health insurers operate in a highly competitive market and I cannot interfere in the operation of that market.</p><p>However, it is my understanding that the three main health insurers have reached agreement with the majority of private hospital facilities regarding charges for pre-admission COVID-19 testing, while continuing to work with those providers who they have not yet finalised agreements with.

This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly.</p>  <p>  This is with an aim of delivering a more consistent service. The improvements which will be implemented will see the building of a dedicated workforce for Covid-19 Testing. The testing service will employ a 3,000 strong workforce. The HSE is currently recruiting over 700 people to take swabs and over 500 contact tracing staff all around the country. Both campaigns have been launched and the HSE is actively screening and interviewing candidates for immediate positions.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also committed to the recruitment of up 150 permanent staff and other temporary staff to ensure there is capacity to deal efficiently and effectively with public health emergencies with scale and speed, both now and in the future.</p></reply>

At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds. Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds and two paediatric critical care beds was provided as part of the response to Covid-19 in March 2020.</p>  <p>  Surge capacity supports the provision of critical care as required, with the number open on any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff. At the outset, substantial work was carried out to develop a critical care capacity plan, including identification of additional ICU and ventilation spaces. The development of the plan, including consideration of staffing, ventilators and oxygen capacity, involved considerable input from clinical, operational and estates perspective, all of which was essential to the intensive effort to deliver the necessary surge capacity. </p>  <p>  Training was provided to over 1,500 nursing staff to allow them to provide support to critical care as required. The number of critical care beds open and staffed at any one time can flex with demand, and staffing challenges and clinical risk continue to increase as the number of surge beds increases.</p>  <p>  The acute hospital system and critical care service coped with the initial surge in admissions during the early stages of the pandemic, and were not overwhelmed, as was seen elsewhere, largely due to the success of public health measures in flattening the curve and the fall-off in non-Covid care. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE have been engaging in regard to critical care capacity requirements in the public hospital system and consideration is ongoing.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy is specifically interested in the expected ICU occupancy levels in a non-Covid environment and in the expected occupancy levels at each stage of the roadmap. I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on those issues as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to reform of the planning and appeals processes as set out in the Programme for Government and we have published draft legislation to this effect which will be presented to the Seanad this week. </p>  <p>  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project. This plan is already yielding progress with felling licences issued in August the highest in the previous 13 months in both volume and area. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned above, in tandem with this plan a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced which aims to increase efficiencies in the appeals process. I very much welcome the almost 9,000 submissions on the Bill which have informed the updated Bill I will present to the Seanad this week.  </p>  <p>  While the licensing delays are affecting the timber being felled and transported to sawmills, to date my Department has issued tree felling licences for just under 3 million cubic metres of timber. </p>  <p>  I know that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>
