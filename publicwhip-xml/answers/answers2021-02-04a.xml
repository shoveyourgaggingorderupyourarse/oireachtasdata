    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-04a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020400053#WRA00500"><p>The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, however, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the employment permits system is responsive to changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions, it is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market. </p>  <p>  In May 2018, following consideration of a detailed business case submitted by the sector, a pilot quota-based scheme was introduced to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  This pilot scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities.  To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector. The quota for dairy farm assistant has now expired, with all 150 permits issued.  </p>  <p>  Last month, Minister of State Damien English TD, engaged with the Irish Farmers Association and Producers on matters relating to employment in the agri-food sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Consideration of the submissions received in the most recent review is underway. Submissions have been received in respect of this sector and will be considered in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by this Department. The review will be finalised in February 2021.</p></reply>

I understand that the meat processing plant which is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>From the 1 January 2021 to 29th January 2021, the Health and Safety Authority has completed 50 inspections of meat processing facilities and over 239 inspections of Meat Process Facilities since the 18 May 2020, which include those connected with COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition, as of 22 January 2021, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) inspectors completed 645 COVID-19 inspections on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority in DAFM-approved food premises, and these inspections remain ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has no role in checking or enforcing compliance with public health recommendations regarding the quarantining of individuals arriving in Ireland from another country. However, as part of checking compliance with the Work Safely Protocol, inspections will include checking if the procedures set out in the Protocol for employees returning to work after an absence are being followed. </p>  <p>  Of course, anyone arriving from abroad should follow the most up-to-date public health guidance. Information on travelling to Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found at www.gov.ie and this information is updated to reflect any new public health measure. </p></reply>

The annual management advice of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) supported by the annual assessment of individual stocks by, and scientific advice of, the Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS) underpins this management. </p><p>The annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Regulations sets out the surplus available on each river and the opening period and management arrangements.  The relevant regulation for the 2021 season was enacted in December last and I can confirm that the opening and closing date has not been altered for any river in Co. Kerry for the 2021 season.  The opening date for salmon angling on the Rivers Maine &amp;amp; Brown Flesk remains at 17 March to 30 September as it was during the 2020 and previous seasons.</p><p>In addition, the Salmon and Trout Conservation Bye-Law No.623 of 1981 established that the first day of the close season for Salmon rod and line angling on the River Maine, including Brown Flesk, is 1 October each year. The last day of the close season remained at 16 March in each year. The close season for Sea Trout and Brown Trout begins on 13<sup>th</sup>October and ends on 16<sup>th</sup>March each year. In that regard the close season on these rivers is long established to meet the conservation imperative.</p></reply>

I am also aware of the serious decline in mail volumes and the impact of Covid-19 on footfall through post offices has had a severe impact on the postal network and the revenue being generated for postmasters. </p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done over the past few years to develop the network and this has had a positive effect for both postmasters and customers. This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. What we are doing now is working with An Post to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network. As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p>  <p>  The operation of the Post Office Network and the terms under which Postmasters contract with An Post is a matter between the Postmasters and An Post and any negotiations are a matter for both parties directly.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.</p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 26 January 2021, over 166,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. There are some 79,424 premises located in the Intervention Area in County Cork of which 16,132 have been surveyed. Surveys have been completed in Midelton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick, with surveys underway in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Pre-build works are underway in  Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown, and Upper Rochestown. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected  in Carrigaline and construction work is continuing with significant technical testing and validation taking place prior to wider release of the area.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 30 January, 178 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. BCP&rsquo;s connected in Cork are Ballindangan Community Centre (in the area of  Fermoy), Aghabullogue Community Centre (in the area of Donoughmore), Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and T.O. Park Labbamollaga (in the area of Fermoy). Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of the schools aspect of the project was announced late last year and will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 26 January 2021, over 166,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys in County Offaly have been completed in Brosna, Shinrone, Mount Heaton and areas close to the county boundary with Tipperary. Further details are available on specific areas within County Offaly through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.

A Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. Micro-generators will primarily serve their own electricity consumption needs, but will be able to receive a payment for excess electricity exported back to the grid. The proposed support mechanism is outlined in a public consultation on this Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie which is open for submissions until 18th February 2021.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in March last year, which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for  prosumer development this year.

In order to fulfil their statutory functions in this regard, significant powers are available to Local Authorities, including the authority to issue Fixed Payment Notices ranging from &euro;250 to &euro;1,000 and to bring prosecutions under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations.   In the case of prosecutions, the relevant penalties, as set out in the Air Pollution Act 1987 and amended by Section 9 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, are as follows:</p>  <p>  - on summary conviction, a Class A fine (together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a Class E fine for every day on which the offence is continued, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000), or imprisonment for up to six months, or both.</p>  <p>  - on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;500,000 (together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine of up to &euro;5,000 for every day on which the offence is continued), or imprisonment for up to two years, or both.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to further strengthen enforcement of the Regulations by developing a regional approach to air quality enforcement. A coordinated approach is required given the links between burning of solid fuels and the health effects of air pollution, as well as the potential for market distortion for businesses properly adhering to the regulations. Increased multi-agency inspections and enforcement, including the increased use of fixed payment notices, are required and my Department is fully committed to supporting Local Authorities in this regard.  </p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest emissions report, published in January 2021, our 2020 emissions covered by our ESD target are estimated to be 7-8% below 2005 levels. Therefore, Ireland will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations under the ESD. The emissions in respect of the ESD sector for 2010 were 44.5 Mt CO2eq, 42.8 in 2013 Mt CO2eq increasing to 45.7 Mt CO2eq in 2019. The most recent EPA report projects 2020 emissions in the sector as 43.9 Mt CO2eq.   The extent of the challenge to reduce emissions was reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The National Policy Position provided a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050, while statutory authority for the plans was set out in the 2015 Act. This led to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, and National Adaptation Framework, published in 2018. In 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s first Climate Action Plan was published. The ambition in 2019 Plan was further increased in the Programme for Government which sets out an ambitious course of action over the coming years to address the climate crisis. The Programme for Government commitments will be reflected in the updated Climate Action Plan to be finalised later this year. </p>  <p>  Some of the keys measures and actions that have contributed to mitigation of carbon emissions over the past decade include: </p>  <p>  Emission standards for vehicles introduced by the EU;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the use of biofuels to contribute to the growth of renewable energy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector; </p>  <p>  - Energy efficient schemes in both domestic and commercial buildings, and </p>  <p>  - the introduction of building standard regulations. </p>  <p>  It is clear that heretofore Ireland has not sufficiently reduced it&rsquo;s non-ETS green house gas emissions and a step change in ambition commenced in the 2019 climate action plan. I plan to bring forward a whole of government climate action plan that will, on a whole economy basis, reduce Irelands Green House gas emissions by 51% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline.</p></reply>

As the designated purchasing agent on behalf of the State, the NTMA administers and manages purchases of carbon credits.   Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period included investments, commencing in 2006, in three multilateral funds: the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund (MCCF) managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and the Carbon Fund for Europe (CFE) and BioCarbon Fund (BioCF), both managed by the World Bank.

BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Colmcille GAA Club, Ballymore Shamrocks GAA Club, Mullinalaghta Community Centre, Corlea Heritage Centre and Aughine Community Centre. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Naomh Guasachta National School (Bunlahy) has been installed by NBI and  Fermoyle National School has been connected for educational access as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at . </p></reply>

A key aspect of delivering on this ambition will be enacting the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which will strengthen the climate governance framework which underpins the on-going development of policies and measures.     I welcome the extensive pre-legislative scrutiny report on the Bill, published by the Joint Committee on Climate Action on 18 December. I was very pleased to note that the report was informed by an extensive engagement by the Committee with relevant experts, including both oral evidence and written submissions to the Committee. I am aware separately that civil society organisations have also contributed their perspectives to the Committee&rsquo;s work on the Bill and I also welcome their engagement in this process. </p>  <p>  I am currently considering the report and its recommendations in the context of the overall framework and objectives of the legislation. I intend to revert to Government in the coming weeks to seek approval for publication of the final text of the Bill, including any amendments arising from the pre legislative scrutiny process,  and will then initiate the Bill in the legislative process in the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

The supports include the wage subsidy scheme, alleviation of commercial rates, deferred tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme.</p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times. The EWSS higher subsidy rate will apply until 31 March 2021. The scheme will continue during 2021 and the Government will decide on the form of its extension when economic conditions are clearer, guided by what the economy requires at that time to support the expected economic recovery. </p>  <p>  In November, the Government also agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the sector. My Department is currently engaging with the European Commission regarding formal approval of this package which will be implemented in line with EU State aid rules. </p>  <p>  Any additional supports designed to facilitate growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, taking account of the outlook for the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis, in consultation with all key stakeholders and relevant Government Departments. </p></reply>

This will require significant investment in our infrastructure and our services and the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits toward such a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland and I look forward to fulfilling that commitment.</p>  <p>  I am also clear that within our sustainable mobility sector, or more particularly within public transport, we need to transition toward low-emission and zero-emission fleets in line with available technologies. </p>  <p>  In bus, that shift has already commenced with the decision to end the purchase of diesel-only buses for the urban centres, the entry into service of hybrid buses, and most recently the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s commencing a procurement process in relation to zero-emission buses for the major urban centres. I understand the NTA is also exploring procurement options for zero-emission fleets in town centres also. This transition is in line with the relevant actions set out in the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In rail, the key focus has been to expand electrification through the DART+ programme of investment which, once completed, will mean around 70% of passenger journeys across the rail network will be on electrified services and will represent a significant shift from the position today. The scope to expand electrification (or the possible use of battery-electric fleet) to Cork and other urban centres has been, or is being, considered as part of their metropolitan area transport strategies. </p>  <p>  In  terms of inter-urban rail, which is obviously a much smaller component of total annual passenger journeys as compared to that covered by the DART+ programme, I have stated my commitment to conduct a Strategic Rail Review and it is my intention that one of the issues that Review will consider will be future decarbonisation of the inter-city / inter-regional networks. I would note that there is no settled perspective on this matter in a European context, as evidenced by the EU&rsquo;s recently published Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy which notes the need for further electrification but that where electrification is not viable other options such as hydrogen should be explored. It is my intention that the forthcoming Review will give an Irish dimension to that European perspective. </p></reply>

Part 42 Chapter 4 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes a legal obligation on employers to make deductions at source under the PAYE system from the payment of emoluments to an employee. Where a fisherman is an employee, he has no entitlement to capital allowances relating to the boat and equipment. </p><p>Where the relationship between the owner and fishermen is a partnership, their relationship will be governed by partnership law.  As is the case with all partnerships, the precedent acting partner is obliged, under the rules of self-assessment, to submit an annual Form 1 partnership return which contains details of the activities of the partnership and includes the identity of the partners and the details of the division of the profits/losses and capital allowances between partners. In general, the precedent acting partner in a boat will be the owner/skipper.</p><p>Where the share fishermen are in a partnership, each partner is required to submit an annual tax return, as they are chargeable persons under self-assessment rules.  There are also obligations to make appropriate preliminary tax payments and pay the balance of any tax due.</p><p>In relation to capital allowances, where a partnership exists, the capital allowances relating to the boat and equipment become the capital allowances of the partnership. This means that the capital allowances are calculated at partnership level and are allocated to each partner. The appropriate share of the allowances is the amount computed in accordance with the profit-sharing ratio included in the partnership agreement for the year of assessment and returned on the annual Form 1 partnership return.  </p><p>Revenue has published guidance on the tax treatment of share fishermen which is available on their website at: .</p><p>Finally, if the Deputy has concerns about a particular case or class of cases in relation to this issue, he might wish to raise the specific details of those cases with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, including exemption from USC and PRSI.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that the Department of Social Protection (DSP) shares taxable benefit payment details, including information relating to the PUP, with Revenue in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. These data exchanges are subjected to rigorous testing procedures to ensure any information updated to taxpayers&rsquo; records is accurate and fully reflects the information provided to Revenue by DSP, thereby ensuring they pay the right amount of tax in respect of their overall taxable earnings. Revenue has confirmed that the 2020 PAYE &lsquo;Preliminary End of Year Statements&rsquo; (PEOYS), which were made available to all employees on 15 January 2021 included the PUP related data provided by DSP. This data reflected the actual PUP payments made to each person and did not include any element of estimation. It is, however, possible that the final year position for 2020 for some employees could alter if subsequent updates are provided to Revenue by DSP for that year, for example arrears payments or additional taxable welfare payments. </p>  <p>  As regards the number of PUP recipients who have a tax liability now arising from receipt of the payment, Revenue have advised me that they published a detailed breakdown of the position of PAYE taxpayers for 2020, based on their PEOYS. The information is available at the following link,:</p>  <p>  https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/registrations/paye-preliminary-eoy-statements.pdf , </p>  <p>  It shows the distribution of overpayments and underpayments, by amount (including averages), for all relevant PAYE taxpayers.  This includes those who received the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) either separately or combined. The published information also includes those who did not receive any PUP or TWSS payments.  While it is not possible to identify whether an underpayment is solely due to a taxpayer unit having been in receipt of the PUP, table 2 sets out the position for those taxpayer units who received only the PUP and not a combination of the PUP and the TWSS, table 3 sets out the position for  those persons who underpaid in increments of &euro;100; and table 4 provides information on taxpayer units who received a combination of the TWSS and the PUP. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am informed by relevant officials that they are not aware of having received any contacts in the Department from individuals as a result of incorrect figures.   However, in the normal course of events, such approaches would be dealt with by Revenue.   In this regard, Revenue have confirmed that they provide a PAYE Helpline for employees.  It receives significant volumes of calls each day in respect of all aspects of PAYE, including the taxation of social welfare payments.</p></reply>

For the information of the Deputy, the link directs to Revenue&rsquo;s material on Frequently Asked Questions on the TWSS:</p><p>The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  However, the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, the question of what wages an employer would be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the question of an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees at pre-COVID levels in the light of the impact of the pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters between the employer and the relevant employees and were outside the remit of the TWSS.  </p><p>An employer who received TWSS payments under the scheme was obliged to pass on any such payments to its employees.  Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer/employee eligibility for the TWSS.</p><p>Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC).  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. </p><p>When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end.  </p><p>Although the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances, and still pending for the overall amount of tax due, based on data that Revenue released in January, it is noted that almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).</p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000. If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.  These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  </p><p>Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities remain following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.It is also understood that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the scheme.</p><p>Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p><p>Finally, the Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out a provisional tax position for 2020, based on information available on Revenue records, including any Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments reported by the individual&rsquo;s employer.  Revenue published provisional statistics in relation to the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for the year 2020, on 14 January 2021 which is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website:</p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

While the Institution applies a climate lens to all of its policies and operations, its primary goals are to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. It recognises the link between poverty/prosperity and climate and the potential for climate change to push much more of the world's population into poverty by 2030. The World Bank has therefore enjoined the fight against climate change and its Climate Change Action Plan 2021-2025 seeks to mobilise $200 billion in support of developing countries to take climate action during the course of its lifetime. A summary of this plan&rsquo;s ambition, is available at  . The Bank also uses the true cost of carbon in all its projects. Therefore, while the funds the World Bank manages are not dedicated &lsquo;climate&rsquo; funds, as I will outline below, climate considerations significantly influence how the Bank targets it&rsquo;s resources. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the World Bank consists of five separate entities.  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) provides loans, credit, and grants to low to middle income countries while the International Development Association (IDA) provides low or no-interest loans and grants to low-income countries. The other parts of the World Bank include: (i) the International Finance Corporation (IFC) which provides investment, advice, and asset management to companies and governments; (ii) the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) which insures lenders and investors against political risk such as war; and (iii) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which settles investment disputes between investors and countries. </p><p>Ireland is a donor to IDA, the largest sources of assistance for the world&rsquo;s 74 poorest countries (39 of which are in Africa). Overseen by 173 shareholder nations, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing zero to low-interest loans and grants for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people&rsquo;s living conditions. Since its establishment in 1960, IDA has provided $422 billion for investments in 114 countries. IDA is a multi-issue institution, supporting a range of development activities (including climate change) that pave the way toward equality, economic growth, job creation, higher incomes, and better living conditions. IDA-financed operations address primary education, basic health services, clean water and sanitation, agriculture, business climate improvements, infrastructure, and institutional reforms. The World Bank Group publishes details of all projects and operations, including associated documentation, on their website -   . </p><p>IDA&rsquo;s policy framework is reviewed by its members every three years during the course of the &ldquo;replenishment process&rdquo; when donor members pledge financial support to the institution. Officials from my Department represent Ireland at these meetings in order to articulate Ireland&rsquo;s development priorities and ensure that they are reflected in IDA&rsquo;s policy commitments. For the most recent replenishment, IDA19, members agreed on five special themes for IDA19: climate change; fragility, conflict and violence; gender; governance and institutions; and jobs and economic transformation. IDA19 also incorporates four cross-cutting issues: debt, disability, human capital, and technology. In 2019, Ireland pledged approx. &euro;102m to this replenishment (IDA19), an increase on the &euro;90m commitment to the previous replenishment (IDA18) in 2016.</p><p>Aside from IDA progress updates furnished during the course of the formal plenary Spring and Annual Meetings, Mid-Term Review (MTR) meetings are held as part of the formal replenishment process. During the MTR, members review progress on policy commitments and identify any mid-course corrections or adjustments required. My Officials represent me at this event and, in collaboration with other Donor Governor Representatives, rigorously monitor and scrutinise progress against stated objectives across all policy and governance areas. These discussions, which are held over a number of days, provide further opportunity for IDA Donors to engage with Senior Management on the Bank&rsquo;s performance and on programme delivery.  </p><p>To support these discussions, a report on the implementation of the replenishment is provided in advance of the meetings, identifying emerging challenges and lessons learned. Much of this reporting is informed by IDA&rsquo;s Results Measurement System (IDA RMS). Introduced in 2002, the IDA RMS is a key reporting and accountability tool for tracking progress and reporting results achieved by IDA during each replenishment cycle. The IDA RMS provides a snapshot of country-level, long-term development outcomes; development results in countries supported by IDA operations across different sectors; and IDA&rsquo;s organisational and operational effectiveness. Annual reports on the IDA RMS are published on the IDA website - https://ida.worldbank.org/results/rms. </p><p>The IDA RMS is supplemented by other tools to provide a more comprehensive picture of IDA&rsquo;s activities and impact, including the work conducted by the World Bank&rsquo;s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The IEG Annual Report on the Results and Performance of the World Bank Group provides analysis of how the different institutions deliver on key goals and more detailed evidence on the performance of country programmes and projects. The Annual Report is available on the World Bank IEG website - . To assist external oversight, the IEG also produces &lsquo;Implementation Status and Results Reports&rsquo; which provide regularly updated information on progress directly from individual projects under implementation and &lsquo;Implementation Completion and Results Reports&rsquo; which record achievements against a project&rsquo;s development objectives.</p><p>These toolsets and platforms provide important information on the value and efficacy of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the World Bank. These insights not only inform Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with the Bank but influence and guide analysis and decisions regarding further investment.</p><p>Finally, I would like to make the Deputy aware that Ireland also provides funding to a number of separate World Bank Trust Funds including:</p><p>- Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)</p><p>- Blue Economy in the Caribbean</p><p>- International Finance Corporation (IFC) Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS</p><p>- Adaptation Fund (AF)</p><p>- Global Environment Facility (GEF)</p><p>However as these are variously administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as opposed to my Department, I do not propose to comment on Ireland&rsquo;s oversight of these funds.</p></reply>

The SDGs are a global blueprint for collective progress to a more prosperous and sustainable world by 2030. The SDGs are applicable to all countries, developed and developing, and action is required for their implementation both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Ireland is committed to implementing the SDGs, and published its first SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 in July 2018. While the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has lead responsibility for promoting and overseeing the coherent implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the whole-of-Government approach to implementation of the SDGs means all Ministers are responsible for implementing the SDGs related to their functions. I have appended in tabular form the goals and sub-targets for which my Department has been assigned responsibility. </p><p>As the Deputy will note, the targets assigned to the Department of Finance as either lead or stakeholder extend across a significant range of its business and activities ranging  from promoting inclusive economic growth to building partnerships for sustainable development. My Department has published these obligations at . While there may be some review of assignment changes in the next National Implementation Plan, significant change is not anticipated. </p><p>My Department expects to shortly publish it&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 which shall outline the role the Department of Finance will play in the delivery of the Programme for Government&rsquo;s targets and priorities. I can confirm that the new Statement is informed and guided by the Department&rsquo;s commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s National Implementation Plan which implements the UN SDGs. Acknowledgement of SDG commitments within Statements of Strategy is not only in line with actions championed in the National Implementation Plan but is also an important further step in mainstreaming the SDGs into relevant policies. The Statement of Strategy is critical in the delivery of policy objectives insofar as it provides a framework to translate such objectives into policies and operational business plans designed to achieve implementation. My Department's obligations in respect of the achievement of SDGs have therefore been embedded within the fabric of how it does its business . It is my hope that these steps towards enhanced policy coherence, alignment and mainstreaming of SDGs into policy areas will contribute to an accelerated progression towards SDG implementation.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, delivery on the SDGs is underpinned by an implementation and reporting process. Given the broad scope and cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, strong and effective governance arrangements which are essential to ensuring high-level engagement with the 2030 Agenda and effective interdepartmental cooperation on the implementation of the Goals, have been put in place.  A Senior Officials Group (SOG) has been established to co-ordinate and monitor SDG implementation and to report, as required, to Government. The SOG is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. To further support the work of the SOG, an Interdepartmental SDG Working Group was established, comprised of representatives from all Departments with responsibilities for the SDGs. To accentuate the all-of-Government approach and ensure policy coherence, my Department is supportive and fully engages with this SDG governance architecture. </p><p>My Department also continues to participate in SDG Stakeholders Forums. These events provide an opportunity to engage with stakeholders and civil society groups on an ongoing basis in relation to SDG implementation. These are all important channels of reporting and monitoring SDG progress. The convening of such fora have been understandably curtailed by the pandemic, but will no doubt be reactivated when circumstances permit. </p><p>Internationally, the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) is responsible for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda at the global level. The HLPF meets annually and features inputs from national governments, intergovernmental bodies, relevant UN agencies, civil society and other stakeholders.</p><p>Countries are encouraged to review implementation of the SDGs regularly and present Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) at the HLPF. Ireland presented its first VNR at the HLPF in July 2018. Having input into the first VNR , I expect my Department to be an active contributor in the next National Review in 2022.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that, as of 2020, the EU Semester process of Economic governance and coordination has a new focus on Green and Sustainable issues. This new focus takes account of the European Green Deal as Europe&rsquo;s new growth strategy, and incorporates the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals into all stages of the process. Progress towards achieving the UN SDGs are monitored within this process using:</p><p>- The Country Report for each Member State which contains data  setting out the  progress in each Member State across the 17 SDGs towards achieving these Goals by 2030, and</p><p>- Each Member State&rsquo;s National Reform Programme assesses performance in implementing the UN SDGs.</p><p>These documents are made publicly available as soon as they are published.</p><p>ANNEX 1 _Department of Finance - Sustainable Development Goals and Targets</p></reply>

All complaints now received by the FSPO are subject to an initial review within 5 working days of receipt. Following this initial review, complaints that appear to have been submitted accompanied by all of the required documentation, and where the Complainant has exhausted the provider&rsquo;s Internal Dispute Resolution mechanism in advance, are assigned within 2 business days of the initial assessment to an officer to conduct a verification review.

The advice provided by Revenue prior to this has been consistently on the basis that the actual position as regards the operation of tariffs from 1 January 2021 was subject to the availability of the text of the trade deal agreement. </p>  <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules on origin are met. The customs tariff duty on the import of vehicles of UK origin is 0%. However, where the vehicles being imported from the UK are not of UK origin then customs tariff duties apply. The tariff rate in any given instance depends on the type of vehicle being imported. For example, passenger cars of non-UK origin are liable to a customs tariff rate of 10%. Customs tariff duty, if applicable, applies on the customs value of the vehicle. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance.</p>  <p>  Customs is an EU competence and is governed by EU legislation including the recently negotiated trade agreement with the UK. This legislation applies in all Member States, and it is not possible for Ireland to implement any measures that are not in compliance with the TCA.</p></reply>

Customs duty may be chargeable on imports over &euro;150, depending on the origin of the goods. </p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has eliminated customs duties for goods imported from Great Britain where the goods are of UK origin under the Rules of Origin in the agreement. Importers of goods to Ireland must claim the preferential tariff rate of 0% on the import declaration and must be able to prove that the goods they are importing are of UK preferential origin. The exporter in the UK should be able to provide the required proof. Goods of non-UK origin imported from the UK will be liable to customs duty.</p><p>Customs duty is normally calculated as a percentage of the customs value of the goods. The percentage rate of duty varies depending on the type of goods being imported. Regarding the customs duty rate on agricultural equipment, the rate varies depending on the classification of the goods and additional information is necessary in order to determine the category of equipment and the associated customs duty rate that applies. The customs value on which customs duty is calculated is the cost of the goods plus the transport costs, any insurance fees and any handling charges to deliver the goods to the EU.</p><p>The EU TARIC database, which is available via the Revenue website, can be used to determine the classification of goods and the 3rd country customs duty rate that applies on imports into the EU. Further information on the classification process is available on the Revenue website at . Importers having difficulty in determining the product classification code for a particular product should contact the Revenue Tariff Classification Unit through Revenue&rsquo;s secure MyEnquiries service or email: tarclass@revenue.ie for guidance. A detailed description of the product should be included to assist with classification. </p></reply>

The following sections provide an update on the latest guiding policies and work programmes that are being progressed to meet the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals.  </p>  <p>  Sub-action under SDG goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</p>  <p>  Update on building resilient and sustainable infrastructure</p>  <p>  The current guiding policy is Project Ireland 2040, which consists of my Department&rsquo;s National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 &ndash; 2027 and the National Planning Framework as led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The current NDP sets out total investment of approximately &euro;116 billion across all sectors and this will allow Ireland to move close to the top of the international league table for public investment. </p>  <p>  Climate Action and Sustainability were core to the design of both the NDP and the National Planning Framework. Both policies address 10 key National Strategic Objectives, with one of the strategic outcomes identified being &ldquo;Transition to a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society&rdquo;. As a result, &euro;21.8 billion has been prioritised for investment in the low carbon transition, with a further &euro;8.6 billion allocated for investment in sustainable public transport. Specific investments identified include flagship investment programmes such as supports for energy efficiency and retro-fitting, to the delivery of major new public transport projects such as MetroLink and BusConnects. In addition, the &euro;500 million Climate Action Fund is also providing funding on a competitive basis for initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets or offer the potential for innovative interventions in these sectors. More generally the approach to sustainable compact growth that is set out in the National Planning Framework and the NDP will support a more balanced pattern of development across the country. This will put an end to the urban sprawl of the past and support greater sustainability and climate resilience.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a review of the NDP that is taking place currently. In line with the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, this review will be focussed on how can Project Ireland 2040 be further supported to deliver on the policy priorities in the Programme for Government, particularly climate action. Also, the NDP Review will focus on balanced regional growth and alignment with Ireland's spatial strategy of NPF. Overall, timelines include a Phase 1 report to be published by the end of Q1 2021, which will form part of the evidence base for finalising the drafting of the revised NDP; and Phase 2, which will be a revised NDP setting ten year capital ceilings out to 2030 alongside five year rolling departmental capital ceilings and priorities would be published in Q2 2021.</p>  <p>  Sub-action under SDG goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</p>  <p>  Update on the promotion of sustainable public procurement practices</p>  <p>  Metrics are key to enable monitoring and verification of any measures introduced aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of public works projects.  In this regard the Office of Government Procurement is currently engaged with the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS) coalition in the development of an international reporting system for whole life carbon in the built environment.  The ICMS coalition anticipate that ICMS 3rd Edition, incorporating Life Cycle Analysis, will be available for public consultation by September 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition to the work on developing standard metrics, consideration is also being given to the following:</p>  <p>  - The incorporation of Life Cycle Analysis into the design stage,</p>  <p>  - The availability of open source Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) to industry,</p>  <p>  - Development of award criteria for assessment of tenders incorporating Life Cycle Analysis,</p>  <p>  - Development of guidance for the incorporation and evaluation of Life Cycle Analysis in public procurement.   </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) published an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in late 2018. This note helps policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives, including environmental sustainability, as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects. In conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the OGP has introduced reforms that require all Departments to consider including green criteria in public procurement processes. Circular 20/2019 also requires Departments to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles and highlights the possibilities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement. The OGP also assisted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in developing training in this area aimed at procurement practitioners and have contributed to the upcoming EPA Green Public Procurement Guidance. The OGP also established a cross Departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group in March 2019, now called the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. </p></reply>

The Ambassador of Ireland to India has raised this case at senior levels within India&rsquo;s Ministry of External Affairs and the Embassy receives regular updates on the conditions of detention of the human rights defender who is elderly and has a health condition. I was disappointed to learn that the courts have refused bail in this case, but understand that certain essential items of personal care have been provided after judicial intervention.</p>  <p>  The Embassy joined other EU Member States in raising the case with the National Human Rights Commission of India, expressing concern about the conditions of his detention, given the age and health profile of the human rights defender, and raising the possibility of his release on humanitarian grounds. However, the National Human Rights Commission having reviewed the circumstances of the arrest and detention, found that no protection applies on the grounds of infringement of human rights. In light of this outcome, I have asked that this case be raised at the forthcoming meeting of the EU-India Human Rights Dialogue.</p>  <p>  The promotion of human rights, including the protection of human rights defenders, is a priority of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland expects the Indian authorities to have due regard for the wellbeing of the human rights defender in this case during his detention and to have full respect for the rule of law including presumption of innocence.</p>  <p>   Our Embassy in New Delhi will continue to monitor developments in this case.</p></reply>

Civilian CSDP is a vital element in the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Global Strategy and the Compact will make it more capable, flexible and responsive to the needs of our external partners.</p>  <p>  Through Civilian CSDP, the EU engages with partners to support them in building capacity around Rule of Law, policing and civil administration, which are vital to establishing and maintaining the security and stability which their societies require to thrive. The Compact will also enhance the capacity of the EU to respond to new and emerging challenges in our neighbourhood. </p>  <p>  Ireland finalised its National Implementation Plan for the Civilian CSDP Compact in November 2019, covering the period to 2023. It was presented at the inaugural Civilian CSDP Annual Review Conference held in Brussels that same month. I am attaching a copy to this response.</p>  <p>  Our National Implementation Plan includes a range of actions designed to further, at a national level, the 22 commitments agreed in the Compact. Progress on implementation of the compact was discussed at the second Annual Review Conference, held virtually in Brussels in November 2020. </p></reply>

Officials from our Embassy in New Delhi and our Consulate General in Mumbai have visited the court and met with the prosecutor. Officials from our Consulate in Mumbai have also attended trial hearings where possible. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible for our officials to directly intervene in local judicial processes, nor would it be appropriate to comment on the details of a legal process in another jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the distress caused to the family by the ongoing delays and the slow rate of progress in this case, and our officials have highlighted this in their engagements. However, the prosecutor has made it clear that, while the Goan authorities are prioritising this case, they are not in a position to treat it differently from other similar cases involving local victims. </p>  <p>  We are also advised that the fast track courts (FTC) mechanism, referred to by the Deputy, is intended to provide more resources to special courts which focus on particular categories of crimes, for example those involving children, but not murder cases such as this. As the Deputy will appreciate, the local courts system has also been subject to delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. </p>  <p>  We very much appreciate the tragic nature of this case and the ongoing distress for the family. As the Deputy will be aware, on 21 February 2020, the Minister for Justice launched a new Victim&rsquo;s Charter, which includes an amendment recognising victims of violent crime abroad and their family members in Ireland. The amendment was made in particular memory of this citizen, and sets out the rights and entitlements to the services provided by the relevant State Agencies in Ireland. In line with this Charter, and where appropriate, consular officials in my Department provide families with details of specialist services in Ireland, such as those arranged by Advic and Support after Homicide. These can provide confidential support to people whose lives have been affected by homicide.</p>  <p>  Please be assured that we will continue to engage with the authorities in India regarding this case, and  to provide all possible consular assistance to the family as appropriate. </p></reply>

The SDG vision of a safer, more peaceful, equal and sustainable world is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and underpins Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, A Better World.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy for 2021-2025 will shortly be shared with the Oireachtas.  That Statement of Strategy informs the business plans of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which continue to reflect the centrality of the SDGs and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to Agenda 2030, reflecting the cross cutting importance of SDG implementation for all of my Department&rsquo;s work. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming Statement of Strategy will have a focus on &lsquo;Our Values: To work for a fairer, just, secure and sustainable world&rsquo;, identifying four key outcomes which the Department will continue to work towards:</p>  <p>  -  A Secure World: A stable and secure rules based international environment</p>  <p>  -  A Just World: Promotion and protection of human rights internationally</p>  <p>  -  A Fairer World: Progress in eradicating poverty, hunger and promoting inclusive economic growth</p>  <p>  -  A Sustainable World: A framework for sustainable development addressing climate change, public health, food security and sustainable economic recovery </p>  <p>  These key outcomes are in turn associated with very specific priority outputs for the Department.  In line with the Programme for Government, the Department has also established a Climate Unit within the Development Cooperation and Africa Division, which will assist in further developing our approach to mainstreaming climate change policy.</p>  <p>  There is a whole-of-Government approach to SDG implementation both at home, and in our contribution to the achievement of the SDGs globally - so that no one is left behind.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is the lead Department on the SDGs. An interdepartmental working group coordinates action across Government on the SDGs and officials from my Department participate in this as well as in the national SDG Stakeholder Forum, which brings different stakeholders together.  </p>  <p>  As part of the follow-up and review arrangements for the SDGs, Ireland's next national SDG progress report (the Voluntary National Review) is due to be presented to the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) in 2022. At last year&rsquo;s virtual HLPF, my colleague Minister Eamon Ryan reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the ambitious targets set in Agenda 2030.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing its active engagement in progressing the SDGs through the Government&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, and in international forums for SDG implementation, particularly through the United Nations system. Our current membership of the UN Security Council enables us to make a strong contribution to SDG 16, which promotes peace, justice and strong institutions.  </p></reply>

It was designed with full awareness and sensitivity to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances, and with an active desire to find arrangements that work for people and businesses on the ground. </p>  <p>  Article 16 of the Protocol reflects provisions on safeguards in other trade agreements. The Protocol sets out how it should be utilised, with due regard to notification, consultation, and engagement. Short-circuiting these processes risks undermining trust and goodwill. </p>  <p>  It is regrettable that the Protocol became embroiled in the dispute over vaccine procurement and that full information was not provided to Ireland in a timely way. It should not have happened. Thankfully, a speedy resolution was possible. The immediate action by the Commission in responding to our concerns is appreciated. We are engaged with the Commission to ensure that in the future there is timely and appropriate consultation in advance of any decision being taken that could have implications for the Protocol. </p>  <p>  Mechanisms for effective and positive engagement are contained within the Protocol, as has already been demonstrated through the joint efforts of the EU and UK in finding an agreed approach to implementation in December 2020. We must all redouble our efforts to support effective implementation of the Protocol, to the benefit of all people on this island.</p></reply>

The current COVID-19 arrangements in place for teachers are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0049/2020.</p>  <p>  My Department has an enhanced Occupational Health Service (OHS) in place, to provide employers with occupational health advice in relation to employees&rsquo; fitness for work.  The current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance.</p>  <p>  A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the teacher to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.   The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, high risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector. </p>  <p>  Where a teacher considers the OHS "Covid-19 Health Risk Categorisation report" places him/her in an incorrect risk category, he/she may request review. The teacher may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. </p>  <p>  Based on HSE advice, a teacher categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; must not attend the workplace.  However he/she remains available for work and the employer should prioritise alternative working arrangements to the maximum extent possible e.g. working from home.   The employer may appoint a substitute, paid by my Department, to replace the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; teacher in the classroom.  During the current school closure period, a substitute may not be appointed by the employer for the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; teacher, as all teachers currently available for work, are working remotely at this time. </p>  <p>  All employers are required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place.  The Plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees.   A teacher deemed &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;normal risk&rsquo; can attend the workplace safely, where the school is implementing the COVID-19 Response Plan and the health advice for schools.  The employer has a responsibility to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full. </p>  <p>  There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the COVID-19 Response Plan with the teacher and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place for the protection of school employees. </p>  <p>  Every school has at least 1 Lead Worker Representative whose role is to represent staff and who may consult with, and make representations to school management on any issue of concern in relation to COVID-19, including issues relating to at risk groups.</p></reply>

It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources, moving to a needs-based model of support and ending the requirement for parents to secure a formal diagnosis to gain access to resources.  </p>  <p>  With the frontloaded model of SNA allocation, schools will have discretion, greater autonomy and greater flexibility on how their SNA allocation is deployed to meet the needs of students with additional care needs. However, there is no change in SNA duties.</p>  <p>  In recommending the frontloaded model the NCSE recommended that the SET allocations, based on school profiles, provides the strongest predictor of the level of care needs in a school to base the frontloaded allocations for mainstream SNA allocations.</p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  However, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings in March 2020. It was decided that the introduction of the model would be deferred for one year i.e. to the start of the 2021/22 school year.  This will allow time for the necessary planning and training for schools.</p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Department Circular 30/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in relation to national rollout of the frontloaded model for the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

This guidance to schools was developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including teachers, parents and learners.  The guidance included provision to support the continuity of teaching and learning in response to the Covid-19 restrictions for those learners unable to engage with online learning.  This guidance is available at gov.ie.</p><p>As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation. This can include the purchase of ICT devices including laptops, tablet devices and hybrid computing devices, that can be shared with students and teachers who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p><p>This ICT Grant funding issues to schools, as schools are best placed to identify the needs of their learners and to meet those requirements. </p><p>In addition my Department directly funds the provision of broadband connectivity for schools at a cost of some &euro;13m per annum.  School buildings will remain open to allow staff access where this is essential to facilitate remote learning.</p><p>Responsibility for ensuring that learners receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with the school in which they are enrolled. Regular and ongoing communication between school and home will be essential to support engagement with learning and continuous connection with classmates and school community.  Additional supports will be provided for these learners from within the staffing resources of the school. Schools will have discretion to manage and redistribute their support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils and students.</p><p>Resources to support schools and teachers to the transition to distance learning using technology, including blended learning approaches, are being provided by the Department support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), at .  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Education portal www.scoilnet.ie also contains a wealth of curriculum tagged resources that can be used by teachers, students and parents to support the continuity of learning in the remote environment.</p></reply>

It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p>  <p>  A network of 155 special classes provide ASD and ASD Early Intervention placements for students in North Dublin at Primary and Post Primary level. The admission policies of schools are the remit of the Board of Management of each school and, as such, the NCSE has no role in relation to the number of applicants or waiting lists. Once schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places. </p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p>  <p>  Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity, and the NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new ASD classes at all levels. The NCSE has specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in North Dublin. </p>  <p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-04a.331.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020400058#WRF05000"><p>A core recommendation of the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s (NCSE) Review of the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools and called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of an educational profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of special education teachers (SETs).</p>  <p>  The frontloaded allocation model is intended to ensure that SNA posts are in schools and available immediately to students upon their arrival, reducing delays in accessing support. It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources and facilitates schools allocating the available resources to those with greatest need. </p>  <p>  One feature of the School Inclusion Model is the development of a frontloaded allocation model of SNAs.  Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. The proposed arrangements when implemented will also improve job security for SNAs in schools ensuring greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status.</p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  However, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings in March 2020. It was decided that the introduction of the model would be deferred for one year i.e. to the start of the 2021/22 school year.  This will allow time for the necessary planning and training for schools.</p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Department Circular 30/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p>  <p>  Where schools consider their SNA allocation to be inadequate to meet current needs, a school can seek a review by making an application to the NCSE. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in relation to national rollout of the frontloaded model for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  The supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed. These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p>  <p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2020/2021 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0036/2020 which issued on 13 May 2020.</p>  <p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0036/2020 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).</p>  <p>  My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. </p></reply>

The pandemic has brought significant challenges to the education system, and I am acutely aware of the impacts that this has had on those students preparing to sit their final examinations. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The planning work underway in respect of the State Examinations in 2021 is being assisted by an Advisory Group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months. The advisory group has been convened to advise Government on all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of the group on 22 January, the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union presented its Report on the 2021 State Examinations and Return to School. Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations. </p>  <p>  The sub-group exploring these options has since met on three occasions and has discussed further possible measures that could be taken to address the demands on students preparing for the examinations.  Having regard to the impact of current school closures for face-to-face tuition, there was also discussion on the scope and form of assessment for the various examination components, written and non-written. </p>  <p>  All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.</p>  <p>  A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Education also took place on 1 February which provided an opportunity for consideration of possible options prior to consideration by Government as a whole.</p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Junior Cycle students, have been engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the original closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent when dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.. </p><p>At this point, I want to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing the CE Supervisors continue to engage in discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.</p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p><p>Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue in the near future. </p></reply>

A 117% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available &ndash; by up to 60 percent.</p>  <p>  First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to build on this progress. Among key strategic actions in First 5 is a commitment to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised ELC and SAC to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'.</p>  <p>  To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including an update of the National Planning Guidelines for the development of early learning and care and school-age childcare settings, the extension of regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis and the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040. The development of a new funding model for EELC and SAC also seeks to address issues of accessibility. </p>  <p>  There is also a commitment to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for early learning and care and school-age childcare. Supply of, and demand for, early learning and care and school-age childcare places is currently monitored annually through the Early Years Sector Profile. This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department.</p>  <p>  More information can be found at first5.gov.ie and at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</p>  <p>  My Department has also introduced a range of funding measures to support the sector in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the sector.</p>  <p>  Government decided on January 6 to implement Level 5 restrictions in order to reduce movement in the population, suspending the ECCE programme until 1 February, now extended to 5 March. In order to support the ELC and SAC sector up to 5 March, the Department has announced a range of new funding measures. </p>  <p>  The new funding arrangements are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Services open during this period will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the Community Childcare Subvention Plus  (CCSP), and the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)) These services can also receive the additional 30% of ECCE Programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that include waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible.   </p>  <p>  - Services closed during this period, where the closure is approved by the Department, will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. NCS, CCSP, and AIM). This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible.</p>  <p>  - A newly designed Covid-19 Support Payment has been put in place to support providers with a significant reliance on parental fee income to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable.</p>  <p>  - My Department estimates that the overwhelming majority of providers will be sustainable with these measures. For the small numbers where there are particular challenges, the Sustainability Fund will open a new strand of funding tailored to the present arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Central to the funding arrangements is the enhanced EWSS, which early learning and childcare providers continue to be eligible to access without having to demonstrate reduction in turnover as other employers do.  The enhanced EWSS is estimated to cover 80% of payroll costs or 50% of the full operating costs of the average service.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to monitor supply and demand in partnership with the CCCs during COVID-19. Services experiencing difficulty are asked to contact their local CCCs for support. This support can include help with applying staff ratios, fee setting, addressing cash flow difficulties, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. </p>  <p>The Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 guidance in full can be found at first5.gov.ie/guidance  </p></reply>

These themes take account of the Commission's recommendations and are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families.</p><p>This is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I will be working with colleagues and survivors to advance these matters as a priority. The Government's Strategic Action Plan is now available to view on my Department's website at  .  Many of these actions are complex and will take considerable coordination across a number of Departments to implement but I am committed to ensuring that survivors see tangible results as quickly as is possible.</p><p>Most importantly, we will take a survivor-centred approach, characterised by consistent engagement with former residents and their representative groups, including the survivor diaspora, on the development and implementation of the strategic plan and associated policy responses. I want to commence this enhanced dialogue as quickly as possible. Structured engagement and consultation of this nature requires specific structures, systems and resources to ensure it is inclusive and effective. Innovative methods are required to achieve this objective, especially given the continuing challenges presented by the restrictions necessary to reduce the public health risks associated with Covid-19.  </p><p>As a first step, I have commenced this consultation with members of the Collaborative Forum as I believe that a new and enhanced model of engagement, which builds upon the strengths of the existing process, can increase opportunities for direct engagement with the large number of stakeholders and their representative groups. </p><p>In addition, an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) has been established to develop proposals for a bespoke ex-gratia Restorative Recognition Scheme to provide financial recognition enhanced access to health supports in respect of the issues examined by the Commission of Investigation.  I want the scheme to be designed as early as possible in 2021. The IDG is tasked with reporting by the end of April to enable specific proposals to be brought to Government. </p><p>It is important to say that counselling supports were immediately available to survivors and relevant details are available on my Department's website and through the HSE.  </p><p>I have also prioritised the preparation of Information and Tracing legislation to give individuals the fullest possible access to their birth and early life information.  The database and related records which were transferred recently from the Commission of Investigation to Tusla will greatly support timely access to such information in accordance with this proposed new legislation.</p><p>Related to this legislative work, intensive work is ongoing in my Department to prepare for transfer of the Commission's archive so that subject access requests in relation to these records can be managed in an efficient, effective and transparent manner, in full compliance with the Data Protection Regulatory Framework. Advances are also be made in relation to a number of the specifics actions, including those relating to education and research the development of a central repository for related institutional records. </p><p>Finally, the General Scheme of the Certain Institutional Burial (Authorised Interventions) Bill has now commenced the process of pre-legislative scrutiny process. The Joint Oireachtas Committee of Children, Equality, Disability and Integration has invited submissions from interested parties by 19 February. The Committee will consider those submissions, and may hold public sessions over the following weeks. When it has completed the scrutiny process it will make a report. This will allow the Department to complete the drafting of this important Bill. </p></reply>

It contains 76 targeted actions aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion across all aspects of Irish society, including increased focus on social inclusion measures and improved access to public services. It also aims to addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach. </p>  <p>  The implementation of this Strategy is overseen by a Steering Committee comprised of Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs, which examine and report on issues concerning integration. </p>  <p>  The MIS was initially due to end in 2020.  However, with actions adversely impacted by the onset of Covid-19, the decision has been made to extend the strategy to the end of December 2021. This extension will enable the actions of the Strategy to continue to be implemented while facilitating the preparations for a new strategic policy approach to migrant integration. </p>  <p>  Building on the work of the MIS Mid-Term Progress Report, published in June 2019, an evaluation of the strategy will be conducted before the Strategy&rsquo;s conclusion. Issues concerning people of African descent in Ireland and the wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Ireland will be examined as part of this work to inform the development of a robust successor strategy to the MIS.</p>  <p>  Arising from the recommendations of the mid-term progress report of the Migrant Integration Strategy, an Anti-Racism Committee has been established to help in the fight against racial discrimination in Ireland. The Anti-Racism Committee has a mandate to develop an understanding of the nature and prevalence of racism in Ireland, and to work towards achieving a social consensus on actions required, by State and non-State. Its work will culminate in a draft national action plan against racism for the consideration of Government. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the International Decade for People of African Descent Steering Committee in Ireland to develop a programme of activities to celebrate the United Nation&rsquo;s International Decade for People of African Descent (IDPAD).  This programme will promote the diverse heritage, culture and contribution of people of African descent to Irish communities. </p>  <p>  In order to support integration on a national level, my Department administers a National Integration Fund, a three-year funding programme to promote initiatives to address areas where migrants find it difficult to avail of opportunities on an equal basis with other members of Irish society. Following a competitive funding call launched in August 2020, 18 successful projects located throughout Ireland were granted funding totalling almost &euro;2.2 million over the three year period. This funding will support national organisations and larger-scale initiatives to empower new members of Irish society to play an active part in their communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Communities Integration Fund, which has been in place since 2017, provides small grants (&euro;1,000 - &euro;5,000) to community organisations for initiatives to promote integration at local level. In 2020 my Department administered funding of &euro;500,000 to support these initiatives and 113 projects were successful in their applications.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging in integration policy development at an international level through representation on various committees in the EU, Council of Europe and the UN.</p></reply>

The strategies include the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).   </p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services. I chair the meetings of the committees charged with the monitoring and oversight of the strategies, with the exception of the national disability inclusion strategy steering group which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities which is chaired by Fergus Finlay. As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more effective.     </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination, based on socio-economic disadvantaged status, to the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. Research is being undertaken at present and, following receipt of this, I hope to undertake a wider public consultation on potentially amending the Equality Acts to include a socio-economic ground for discrimination. In addition, I also intend to conduct a further and broader review of the Equality Acts.</p>  <p>  The role of monitoring the prevalence of discrimination and prejudice in Irish society is undertaken by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) which is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights and equality institution and is an independent public body that accounts directly to the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State. In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. IHREC is an independent body which publishes reports on an annual basis outlining cases relating to discrimination in which legal advice and/or representation was provided by IHREC.  It also produces research setting out experiences of discrimination experienced on the grounds encompassed by the equality legislation.     </p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on committees at the EU and Council of Europe and at the UN and information gathered from those fora informs the continuing work of my Department.</p></reply>

You raise a most serious issue.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has continued to provide essential frontline services to children and families throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  Tusla&rsquo;s work has focused on ensuring continuity of critical supports and services to vulnerable families  whilst  balancing this need with  public health advice to keep children, families and frontline staff as safe as possible during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Tusla determined that the three priority service areas within the organisation were:</p>  <p>  - Child Protection      (including Out of Hours Social Work Services)</p>  <p>  - Children in Care      (including parental access and court hearings)</p>  <p>  - Domestic and Sexual      Gender Based Violence services.</p>  <p>  When Covid-19 restrictions were first introduced, with schools closing in March 2020, referrals decreased  to child protection and welfare services. The decrease was  from an average of 1,505 per week, to 968 (36% decrease) per week for the initial four week period. Following a local and national media campaign referrals increased, to over 1,300 referrals per week. All indications are that year on year comparisons will show an increase in referrals received in 2020. The most recent monthly referral data shows to the end of October 2020 Tusla had received 52,082 referrals, over the same period in 2019 Tusla received 49,963 referrals already an increase of 4%.   </p>  <p>  In June 2020, my Department developed an information and media campaign entitled SupportingChildren.gov.ie. For the first time this brought together information on all the services, structures and supports which are in place for vulnerable children, young people and their families during the Covid pandemic. Critically this also included the range of step-up actions and innovations that were also being advanced to support these groups. I can inform you that this initiative is about to begin again. It is important that this vulnerable cohort of children and their families know that support continues to be available during these challenging times.  </p>  <p>  My Department established a Covid response group. Under the umbrella of this team the various facets of my Department keep me informed as to issues affecting children and young people and the impact of Covid-19. The group collates information on the impact of Covid on a variety of services including Tusla Children Residential services, the Oberstown Campus, Youth services, Domestic Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence services, International Protection Accommodation Service, Traveller and Roma services. They also contribute to and monitor the responses put in place to mitigate issues that arise. </p>  <p>  You will be aware of the heightened concern for the safety of partners and children where there is domestic violence.  The Department of Justice is coordinating a Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) group across  Departments and agencies to ensure a coordinated focussed approach to this worrying problem. Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBVIn Budget 2021, myDepartment negotiated an additional &euro;30m for Tusla, specifically allocated for DSGBV services. This includes core funding of &euro;28m and an additional &euro;2m to assist DSGBV organisations in offsetting the effects of COVID-19 on day-to-day services.</p>  <p>   The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments regarding DSGBV, including an audit on segmentation of DSGBV responsibilities across government departments and agencies, which will inform future investments in this area. Tusla is also undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. Substantial progress has been made on a number of processes which contribute to the review, including a literature review, consultations with stakeholders, geographical and census data analysis, consultation with service users and policy analysis. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that the report will be published this April.</p>  <p>   It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible, including children.</p>  <p>  In addition through correspondences and parliamentary queries submitted to my Department, issues affecting children and opportunities to prevent abuse and neglect are brought to the fore. During a crisis such as we face now, if anyone has a concern for the safety and welfare of a child or young person they should bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities without delay.</p></reply>

Since then, I have also secured an additional &euro;5 million investment in youth services for 2021. I see this funding as supporting the frontline services as they seek to innovate to continue to provide critical services to vulnerable young people. </p>  <p>  At a broader level, my Department is committed to leading a discussion with relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that mental health services, educational institutions, youth services and sports clubs work together, so that each is aware of the challenges young people have been facing and can help ease them back into everyday life and support their resilience. </p></reply>

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely.</p><p>From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p><p>- teaching and learning, </p><p>- assessment, and </p><p>- qualifications. </p><p>This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p><p>In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession.</p><p>Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU.</p><p>While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary.</p><p>The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements.  It is in this context that I have asked QQI, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue.  The focus of these engagements will be to identify solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements will facilitate a dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care.  </p><p>Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.</p></reply>

However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. </p><p>In addition, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020, the awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams. SUSI treats each application for repeat funding on a case-by-case basis, and it is it is a matter for the individual student to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that there were exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that last July I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education. This package included a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I also approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

The strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, which is the National Skills Council and the nine Regional Skills Fora.</p><p>Strong collaborative links between the further and higher education system and enterprise have been developed and expanded over recent years. These new relationships allow us to gather insights and data directly from enterprise that feed into high level national policy decisions and allow us to know exactly what enterprise wants us to deliver.Representatives from the further and higher education system are also active partners in national initiatives driven by the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora. </p><p>We are doing well, by some key measures: </p><p>- In relation to graduate supply from the Higher Education sector, in 2019 there was a total of 77,815 graduates from the Higher Education system.  Of this number, a significant proportion were in key skills areas, 4,916 were in ICT, 8,116 in Engineering Manufacturing and Construction and 6,472 in Science and Maths.  </p><p>-  In the IMD World Talent Rankings 2020, Ireland ranked 9<sup>th</sup>out of 63 countries for workforce readiness, which encompasses the degree to which education meets the needs of employers, place of STEM in education, languages, availability of skilled labour as well as other factors related to the labour force. </p><p>-  The Irish National Employer Survey which was published in 2019 finds that 86% of employers are satisfied with the quality of HE graduates.</p><p>- With regard to ICT, we know that technology is accelerating the shift towards the knowledge-based economy. The nexus between human capital, innovation and research will be critical to Ireland&rsquo;s success. <b>Technology Skills 2022: Ireland&rsquo;s Third ICT Skills Action Plan</b>is a collaborative effort by Government, the higher and further education and training system and industry to meet Ireland&rsquo;s high level ICT skills needs<b>. </b>The plan has devised measures that will boost the supply of ICT graduates to meet the ambitious level of demand forecast for the coming years. By 2022, the interventions outlined in this plan aim to deliver up to an additional 5,000 graduates per annum through indigenous supply, with the remainder serviced by inward migration.</p><p>We must continue to evolve and improve in order to meet the rapid changes and challenges of the future world of work, and to shape the economy and society that we want to have. I know that my Department, in collaboration with key stakeholders, will continue to do this work, to help ensure that we meet skills needs on an ongoing basis, and to support economic recovery and economic success.</p></reply>

The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package.   </p>  <p>  A key element of Future Jobs Ireland is to support business, invest in the development of people and to enhance skills and develop and attract talent to ensure our education and training system is responsive to enterprise needs. We must ensure that we have accessible upskilling options and that our education and training providers offer relevant and up-to-date courses which meet the needs of enterprises and workers.   </p>  <p>  Higher Education institutions are constantly reviewing and updating their course curriculum to ensure that undergraduate and taught postgraduate course content is reflecting emerging trends in the future world of work and Industry.    </p>  <p>  I and my department are determined to be the driver of a vibrant sector which produces individuals who are equipped with the skills that they need to progress in the way that they want to, and in a way that meets the needs of our evolving economy and contributes to an inclusive society.</p>  <p>  The higher and further education sectors are critical sources of knowledge creation, innovation, skills and human capital development and critical to our ability to deal with current and future crises is ensuring we have a pipeline of talent coming through our higher education system that is fully equipped to make a valuable contribution to our economy and society.</p></reply>

The enterprise sector provides quality employment which is important for our standard of living and inclusivity.</p>  <p>  The enterprise sector is hugely important in driving innovation in this country. Almost 75% of all Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) expenditure in Ireland is by private enterprises. Our most recent figures show that &euro;2.77 billion was invested in RDI by enterprises in Ireland in 2017, a 24% increase from 2015 and the largest biennial increase in 10 years. These investments have been instrumental in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and growth in the past decade, and will continue to be of critical importance as we face our current and future challenges.</p>  <p>  Productivity is the primary determinant of long-term growth. Investment in knowledge-based capital, and innovation in particular, drives productivity through new, higher value-added products and services, and more efficient business processes. The value of services in the Irish economy exceeds that of manufacturing, and consequently investment in knowledge-based capital is increasingly important for driving future economic growth. This economic reality means that Ireland must be among the top-ranked nations for innovation if it is to realise its potential.</p>  <p>  To that end, my department officials and I have worked to continue to foster and develop existing links with the enterprise sector. We have been engaging with various stakeholders including business groups and companies, and have received their inputs into my department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, which is due to be published shortly. Maintaining links with enterprise &ndash; both indigenous and FDI &ndash; ensures we can keep up to date with domestic needs and global trends. </p>  <p>  I have attended several constructive meetings with industry leaders in recent weeks and will continue to work with them in driving Ireland&rsquo;s vision to become a Global Innovation Leader. We also closely liaise with our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies to ensure a consistent approach in aiding the enterprise sector to increase its innovative activities.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s agency SFI has developed a suite of dynamic funding programmes which facilitate industry/academic collaboration. These funding programmes enable companies and academics to work together on specific programmes of research to address industry needs, support technology transfer and grow skills and expertise. Developing its industry facing programmes to deliver significant public/private partnership, increase collaboration, support FDI and engage SMEs in research and innovation across all sectors will continue to be a priority for the agency as it embeds within my Department.</p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector is one in which SFI has already made significant investments which involve industry participation. One of those investments is CONFIRM, the SFI Research Centre for Smart Manufacturing. The Centre very recently opened its new, cutting edge headquarters in Limerick. This facility includes a testbed to house Ireland&rsquo;s future factory demonstrators, an innovative virtual reality cave, 10 Gbps internet access, Ireland&rsquo;s first private 5G digital manufacturing network and a digital manufacturing lab with 3D printing and non-contact 3D part-scanning facilities. The headquarters will be a space for industry to come together with academic researchers. It is a significant milestone &ndash; heightening Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leader in smart manufacturing.</p>  <p>  Other significant investments in the manufacturing area include IFORM, the SFI Research Centre in Advanced Manufacturing. Like CONFIRM, IFORM is a world leading SFI Research Centre with deep industry collaboration and co-investment. IFORM is delivering the next level of understanding and control for complex manufacturing processes. Ireland is already recognised as having one of the most advanced manufacturing sectors in Europe. These, along with other investments by SFI will support Ireland to become the leading digital manufacturing powerhouse globally.</p>  <p>  Access to highly skilled graduates is a critical success factor for businesses in Ireland. SFI has established six SFI Centres for Research Training. These Centres will support advanced skills and training (PhDs) in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. The six current SFI Centres for Research Training support over 700 PhD students in ICT and Data Analytics. Future skills can be addressed through further development of this programme in other areas, including Innovation in Business Services and Advanced Manufacturing.</p></reply>

There is a number of SFI Centres for Research Training (CRT) linked to the higher education institutions and there is an ambition to do more. The six we have currently are supporting over 700 PhD students in ICT and data analytics. The first 120 students commenced in September 2019. Through the CRTs, students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces and making them a very attractive skills pipeline for industry.</p></reply>

Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and such education activities cannot be held remotely. On 6th January I confirmed that further and higher education will continue to operate primarily online with most activities delivered remotely.  In overall terms, all further and higher education institutions are delivering the vast majority of classes online. </p>  <p>   As with the previous operation of Level 5 restrictions up to early December, those priority activities which can continue onsite subject to the appropriate protective measures, guidelines and local assessment include practical tuition, workshops and skills-based learning (including in relation to apprenticeships) and engagement with vulnerable learners.  In light of the recent deterioration in the Covid-19 situation, institutions will use their existing discretion, taking account of the public health situation nationally and locally, to restrict onsite attendance further, only allowing the most essential work to take place onsite. Local assessment will focus on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means, and are time-critical for students and learners during this period. Reflecting the scale and diversity of third-level provision, further and higher education institutions are best equipped to determine where onsite presence is required.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges faced by students regarding student accommodation this year due to both financial pressures, and the blended learning format of the 2020/21 academic year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector has been actively engaging with students on the issue of accommodation refunds. As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result of reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. </p>  <p>  In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.

Instead, Garda&iacute; deploy a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour in all contexts, including the policing needs of the rail or transport network and its stakeholders. The legal framework that assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime includes provisions under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p><p>In terms of safety on public transport, I understand that Garda management engages with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, Garda numbers are now approximately 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to<b></b>620 new Garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff<b>.</b>These additional resources will further strengthen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s response to all forms of crime, including that which takes place on public transport.</p><p>With specific regards to Cork, I am further advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that as of 31 December 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 723  Garda members in the Cork City Division, 351  in the Cork North Division and 308 Garda members in the Cork West Division.</p><p>In addition, Garda Civilian Staff figures for County Cork on 31 December 2020 show 116 Staff for the Cork City Division, 39 Staff for the Cork North Division and 37  Staff for the Cork West Division.</p></reply>

In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress. In this correspondence, the Judge requested a further extension of the timeline to 1 March 2021, and set out a clear and detailed rationale for this extension.  I understand from Judge Haughton that he provided a copy of this letter to the O'Farrell family and I have also written to the family to inform them of the extension.</p>  <p>  The Judge is of course completely independent in his work, and as Minister I can neither intervene in nor direct the course of the scoping exercise. My Department has been and continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work, and the extensions have, as the Judge has stated to the family, been necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret this further delay, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible and this requires additional time. With regard to any further extensions, the Judge is of course completely independent in his work on this scoping exercise, and I cannot intervene in the process, nor can I place any restrictions on the Judge. </p>  <p>  With regard to the passing of a D&aacute;il resolution in June 2018 calling for a public inquiry into the events surrounding the incident in which Shane O&rsquo;Farrell tragically lost his life, my predecessor as Minister initiated this scoping exercise to examine various matters. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. I am awaiting Judge Haughton&rsquo;s final report to me on the outcome of his scoping exercise and I can assure the Deputy that his final report will be an important part of ensuring that outstanding questions are answered.</p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 50 years of age once they have served at least 30 years and those who joined on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 55 years of age with 30 years service.

Because each application is examined on its own merits, the International Protection Office (IPO), and formerly the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) before 2017, has never kept statistics on the grounds on which applications are made. While an applicant may provide a particular ground at the time of application, following a full examination of the applicant&rsquo;s claim, it may be the case that the applicant does not articulate a well-founded fear of persecution for the ground stated at the time of application, but could be granted under another ground.  An applicant could also articulate more than one ground, or none, at application.</p>  <p>  Every application for international protection is fully investigated to ensure that a fair recommendation can be made.  </p>  <p>  Ireland follows the guidance of the UNHCR in relation to claims for international protection including claims based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity and was one of the first countries to specifically bring sexual orientation within the ambit of a &lsquo;particular social group&rsquo; under the legislation that was in force prior to the 2015 Act. Training for IPO caseworkers and interviewers is very comprehensive and is conducted in conjunction with the UNHCR. The training includes a module in relation to interview techniques and how interviews are conducted.</p>  <p>  The IPO has incorporated the Difference, Stigma, Shame, Harm (DSSH) model into training for caseworkers. The model is designed to help the applicant provide a detailed narrative and to be a sensitive and appropriate way of assessing credibility in sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) claims. The DSSH model is endorsed by the UNHCR and has been adopted by Finland, Sweden, the UK and Ireland amongst other countries. In addition, further written guidance on assessing SOGI claims has been provided to all staff and panel members. </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p><p>I can confirm that the three applications raised by the Deputy have all passed these criteria, and  a request has been sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Finance Division.

E.C. and Media Outlet, is having a profoundly negative impact on grieving parents who are unable to remember their deceased children&rsquo;s names or legacies in public. Being unable to speak publicly about how they want their children to be remembered is wrong and I have committed to changing that. </p>  <p>  I intent to bring proposals to Cabinet next week on how to resolve this issue. I have been working with Senator McDowell and Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan on this and it is my intention to ask the Government to support a Bill in the Seanad from Senator Michael McDowell. However that Bill requires amending to achieve our shared goals and I will be working to secure Government time in the Seanad in the coming weeks to table the necessary amendments .</p>  <p>  I ask that all parties, across the D&aacute;il and Seanad, co-operate in passing the necessary amendment to change Section 252 of the Children Act as quickly as possible in order to give grieving parents back their voice.</p>  <p>  Of course any changes to the Children Act will have to be carefully considered to ensure they are consistent with the key principle of the best interests of the child. This is important as the section to be amended was designed to protect child witnesses as well as victims in the criminal justice process.</p>  <p>  I understand that issues have also arisen on foot of the ruling regarding cases with respect to persons who were children at the time of the offence but adults when the proceedings were taken against the perpetrators. I am also working to address the effect of the ruling  in the context of the legislative amendments that might be required to address this particular matter.</p>  <p>  While I am determined to progress these changes as quickly as possible, it is important that in taking forward any legislative amendments, full consideration is given to all potential issues in order to avoid any unintended consequences the changes might give rise to. </p></reply>

The dreadful effects of this attack last to this day; the suffering of those who have lost what was most precious to them goes on. That the perpetrators of this atrocity have never been held accountable for their crimes can only compound the sense of loss. </p>  <p>  The matter was thoroughly investigated at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with assistance from the Defence Forces and the close cooperation of the authorities in Northern Ireland. Despite their best efforts however, it was not possible to secure the evidence which would have led to the prosecution of the perpetrators. This continues to remain a source of disappointment and frustration. </p>  <p>  I have been further advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Belturbet bombing remains an open investigation and that any new information or evidence will be thoroughly investigated. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the work that is also being undertaken in Northern Ireland under the auspices of Kenova.  &lsquo;Operation Denton&rsquo; is one of a series of ongoing independent UK police investigations or reviews into Northern Ireland legacy cases that are collectively described as the Kenova cases.  &lsquo;Operation Denton' is specifically concerned with matters pursuant to the &lsquo;Barnard Judgment&rsquo; and is an analytical review concerning collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne Gang Series. </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that there are arrangements are in place which support the mutual co-operation, assistance and exchange of information between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Kenova Investigation Team and that engagement is ongoing at this time.  The Historical Investigation Coordination  Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to support this partnership.    </p>  <p>  Finally, and most importantly, I would appeal for anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case to bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities to aid their investigation.  </p></reply>

One of these services is dedicated to gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) (HSE Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Service) and one service is dedicated to sex workers (HSE Women&rsquo;s Health Service). HIV testing is also provided for free for specific populations, such as those who inject drugs, homeless people, migrants and prisoners.</p>  <p>  HIV testing is also included as part of the national antenatal screening programme for all pregnant women in Ireland. The latest report (2018) indicates an uptake of almost 100%.</p>  <p>  HIV testing is available in all hospitals and conducted where this is clinically indicated. Many emergency departments (EDs) offer HIV and hepatitis screening as part of an ED viral screening programme for anyone having bloods taken when they attend the ED. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently piloting a free home STI/HIV testing service, supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. The first phase of tests were made available early January and additional tests will be made available over the coming months. Tests are being made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support.</p>  <p>  All health services, including STI/HIV services are continuing to face service restrictions due to the current impact of Covid-19 on the hospital system and social distancing requirements. Public STI clinics are prioritising those with symptoms or requiring treatment, and this includes anyone who may be referred for confirmation HIV testing. </p>  <p>  Student health services provide STI/HIV testing and STI treatment for their students at a subsidised rate, though some are currently providing testing for free to students, due to the service restrictions elsewhere.</p>  <p>  HIV testing is available through most GP surgeries and private sexual health services for a fee. Home HIV and STI testing kits are also available to purchase in pharmacies.</p></reply>

However, it was necessary to postpone this work due to the urgent need to mobilise and prioritise resources in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  It is the intention of this Department that the review of the NSHS will take place as soon as possible in 2021. While the outcome of this review will determine the future direction of the Strategy, it will also be necessary to ensure that any remaining work items arising from the current Strategy continue to be implemented. </p>  <p>  In light of this, officials from my Department recently wrote to the Interim Programme Lead for the HSE SHCPP, suggesting that we extend the lifetime of the current NSHS to the end of 2021, and requesting that the HSE take any necessary measures to incorporate this into the service planning process. </p>  <p>  Consultation with the relevant stakeholders will be carried out in the course of the review process. </p>  <p>  With regard to the current position in relation to PrEP services, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures. It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for the Department of Health and further information is available here: . </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin this month.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. At present, the HSE has been able to provide adequate PCR testing for identified priorities in response to the very significant demand.</p>  <p>  While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in test performance (particularly in relation to sensitivity) versus some manufacturer claims, with tests not meeting minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available. </p>  <p>  The NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) considers the use of ADTs on an ongoing basis and has endorsed recommendations on the use of ADTs that have been validated as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

It is therefore not open to Irish authorities to grant a marketing authorisation for orphan medicines outside of this framework. </p>  <p>  Evaluating a marketing-authorisation application under the centralised procedure can take up to 210 days, not counting &ldquo;clock stops&rdquo; when applicant companies are requested to provide additional information. It is also possible for an orphan medicine sponsor to submit an application through the EMA&rsquo;s accelerated assessment procedure. This procedure reduces the timeframe for the EMA to review the marketing-authorisation application to 150 days, not including any clock stops. It will then be up to the sponsor company to respond promptly to requests for additional information or data to support its application to avoid extended clock stops.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list. Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted marketing authorisation by the EMA or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. The HSE strives to reach reimbursement decisions in as timely a manner as possible. However, it must ensure that the best possible price is achieved, as these commitments   often represent multi-million-euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process. The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced in a viable and sustainable manner.</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented. In December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals.  Prof Eileen Treacy is the Director of the National Rare Diseases Office, whose purpose it is to provide current and reliable information about genetic and rare diseases to patients, families and healthcare professionals. </p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO), review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. From 01 September 2020, the NRDO has become the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. In line with Slaintecare proposals and the National Model of Care for Rare Diseases 2020, The National Rare Disease Office have plans to implement integrated care pathways for all rare diseases. The work of the NRDO is being overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations. This means that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases is being wound down and any outstanding projects transferred to the NRDO.  </p>  <p>  Building on the significant progress to date, a number of themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  Those themes identified for future progress, include: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy.</p></reply>

Therefore, Fisheries Ministers agreed to set interim Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas for the first quarter of 2021 to ensure continuity for the EU fishing fleet in the early part of the year, pending the outcome of consultations with UK. </p>  <p>  I have sought increases in the provisional TACs for a number of seasonal stocks and the Commission has recently published a proposal to increase the provisional TACs for Nephrops in the Porcupine, Blue Whiting and Celtic Sea Whiting. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the EU-UK Trade &amp;amp; Cooperation Agreement (TCA), the Commission will engage in consultations with the UK on the setting of fishing opportunities for 2021 on behalf of the EU.  These consultations, which are being conducted by video conference, commenced this week.  Member States attend the formal Plenary meeting.  Regular co-ordination meetings through the Council Working Party are held during the negotiations where the Commission updates the Member States on issues/progress and the Member States set out their positions and respond to issues as they develop.  Ireland is represented by officials from my Department.  Industry representatives attend the Plenary meetings and are consulted on an ongoing basis.    </p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when TAC levels reduce below a specified level.</p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other  Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.  The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process following clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.   At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   </p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the upcoming review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  I have previously stated that I am committed to using all opportunities including through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota shares where possible for Irish fishers.</p></reply>

On 18<sup>th</sup>December, provisional fishing opportunities for stocks shared with the UK were set at December Fisheries Council.  </p><p>The TACs for the period 1st January to 31st March 2021 were set for most stocks at 25% of last year's TACs and quotas.  However, I made a strong case that some fisheries are seasonal and are fished in the early part of the year and secured an increased TAC and  quota for these stocks including Horse Mackerel where the TAC and quota was set at 65% of the 2020 quota for the period 01 January to 31 March 2021.  </p><p>In order to allow Irish-registered fishing vessels to commence fishing for Horse Mackerel from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021, on 22<sup>nd</sup>December 2020, the Department issued fishing authorisations and catch limits for Horse Mackerel for the fishing period 1st January 2021 to 31st March 2021.  The available quota, as set at the December Council, was allocated in accordance with Ministerial policy for this stock with 10% held back for any adjustments arising from quota balancing of the 2020 Horse Mackerel fishery. This quota balancing is currently in progress and will be completed as early as possible. </p><p>We are seeking an increase in the provisional TAC for a number of our important seasonal stocks, including Horse Mackerel, in order that these fisheries reflect normal fishing patterns in the year.  However, the Commission proposal on increasing the TACs for the first three months does not include horse mackerel.  We will press for this  increase in the provisional TAC and quotas for this stock to be made available up to the end of March.</p><p>I am currently considering a request received from Industry representatives to increase the catch limit of Horse Mackerel to vessels for the Spring period on the basis of securing an interim swop of this stock from other Member States.</p></reply>

The NFO, whose remit will include the beef sector, will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  It is important to be aware, however, that the Ombudsman will not be able to determine commodity prices. </p>  <p>  Establishment of the NFO is ongoing and firstly requires the drafting of a statutory instrument to transpose the UTP directive before the deadline of May 2021. Legislation is then required to establish the new office of the NFO. It is intended that there will be a national consultation process on the functions of the NFO  prior to the primary legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  With regard to the work of the Beef Taskforce on transparency, the completion of the three market transparency studies commissioned by my Department will be an important step towards improving visibility of the complex supply chain which is integral in fostering trust and enhancing supply chain relationships. These studies will act as an important starting point for driving increased transparency.  It is more important than ever that we all work together given the unique set of challenges currently faced by the sector. Continued strong and constructive engagement in the Beef Taskforce is key to meeting these challenges</p></reply>
