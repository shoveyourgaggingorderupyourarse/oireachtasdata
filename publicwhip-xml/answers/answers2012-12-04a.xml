    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400059#WRA00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 69 together.</p><p>  The vision set out in the Action Programme for Effective Local Government: <i>Putting People First</i> is that local government will be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level &#8211; leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. Consistent with this principle, the Action Programme gives a clear commitment that, in future, the functions of government at local level will be performed through the local government system to the greatest possible extent.  This approach is consistent with the recommendation regarding local government in the &#8220;Take Charge of Change&#8221; Declaration, as are measures to strengthen the role and powers of local government, which is a core objective of reform. Government policy decisions in this regard are set out in the Action Programme. Additional local government functions are specified with particular regard to three key areas: the operation of the local micro-enterprise support service through Local Enterprise Offices; local authority oversight and planning of local and community development programmes; and an enhanced and clearer role in economic development. These decisions represent the most significant enhancement of the role of local government in many decades.</p><p>  In addition, in the course of drawing up the reform programme, Ministers were requested to identify further matters that could be devolved to local government. Initial proposals arising from this process are detailed in the Action Programme. There will be further engagement with a view to identifying additional activities ahead of the development of legislation to implement reform measures.The Action Programme also provides for delegation of greater authority to local level in functions such as environment, water, foreshore, roads, traffic, housing and energy efficiency. This involves giving greater responsibility or discretion to local authorities in relation to various areas in which they already have a significant involvement and where there is scope for reducing the degree of central control. The Action Programme also addresses the issue of citizen engagement and public participation in local government and indicates that mechanisms to promote greater community and citizen engagement with local government will be considered, including possible participative democracy arrangements.</p><p>  An essential component of the Action Programme will be the development and enactment of legislation. Wide-ranging and detailed legislation will be necessary to provide for a range of measures contained in the reform programme. This will include provision for amalgamation of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, including the dissolution of existing authorities, the establishment of new unitary authorities, and the transfer of functions, assets, liabilities, staff, etc., from the existing councils to the successor authorities. Wider legislative provisions will also be required to provide for new arrangements at sub-county and regional levels, together with likely consequential amendments across a number of other legislative codes and to allow for the implementation of a range of new policy undertakings under the Action Programme.  The local government reform programme is a high priority for Government as a key element of the overall reform agenda, and while I am not in a position to provide definitive timing details for the legislation, it will be brought forward for enactment in good time before the 2014 local elections.</p></reply>

The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services. It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a Local Property Tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a Household Charge in 2012 as an interim measure. This was done via the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.</p><p>  An appropriate broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved through the Household Charge and the forthcoming full Local Property Tax. Income from the Household Charge and from a future Local Property Tax is critical in ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to deliver services to their communities.  The independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable Local Property Tax in the context of decisions to replace the Household Charge. It would not be appropriate to comment on the content of the Expert Group&rsquo;s report at this point. It is a matter for Government to decide on the exact details of implementation, taking into account the modalities involved. I anticipate that the Report of the Interdepartmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax will be published shortly after Budget 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400059#WRA01600"><p>The Government&#8217;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, sets out a vision for the future of the housing sector based on choice, fairness, equity across tenures and delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested. Consistent with the Government&#8217;s commitment to equity across tenures, I will not incentivise one form of tenure over another but rather will seek to enable all households to access good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.</p><p>  The Government has already taken a number of steps in this regard. The emphasis in the social housing programme in recent years has shifted from highly capital intensive modes to more flexible delivery models. In this regard the introduction of the social housing leasing initiative and the rental accommodation scheme have served to deliver more housing units more speedily to service the needs in this sector. They have simultaneously served to absorb some of the overhang in the housing rental market, and their continuing deployment will further serve to relieve pressures for people in this sector.</p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has had on-going engagement with NAMA in order to provide units for social housing and a Steering Group comprising my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs) towards achieving this objective. While progress to date has been slow this is due in the main to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints. I hope that the recent establishment by NAMA of a Special Purpose Vehicle, to facilitate the leasing of units, will ensure speedier delivery of a social housing dividend from NAMA&#8217;s operations.  Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered, of the units identified by NAMA for consideration for social housing, to the end of September 2012 demand has been confirmed for over 1,300 available units and these are currently being processed.</p><p>  Data from the Central Statistics Office show that during the 2006 &#8211; 2011 inter-censal period the residential rented sector grew by 47% and its share of the overall housing market grew from 22% to 29%.  The single biggest component of the rented sector is households rented from private landlords which, in 2011, numbered more than 300,000 tenancies.  The <i>Residential Tenancies Act 2004</i> provide s for security of tenure for tenants, minimum obligations for landlords and tenants, and the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to operate a system of tenancy registration and dispute resolution. The 2004 Act also contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and procedures for rent reviews. It specifically prohibits the setting of rent above the market rent and provides both tenants and landlords with the right to a review of rent, which review may not take place more frequently than once in each period of 12 months nor in the first 12 months of the tenancy.  I have no plans to introduce any further measures in relation to rent control at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400059#WRA01800"><p>In 2008 arising from contacts at Head of Government level, a confidential technical information exchange project relating to the Sellafield Site was established, with the cooperation of UK authorities. Through this process, an assessment of the potential risks to Ireland posed by the Sellafield Site and the nearby Low-Level Waste Repository was undertaken on Ireland's behalf by a Team of independent, international experts. The project included site visits by the Team to Sellafield where they were given the opportunity to examine various facilities, access extensive documentation not previously released, and interact with local staff and management. This enabled the Team to develop reliable, accurate risk models and calculations. The work on this project has now been completed and last week a public summary of the assessment was released, and is available on my Department's website at .</p><p>  Based on the results of this Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), the key finding of the Team was that an incident at Sellafield or the nearby Low-Level Waste Repository (LLWR) causing the release of radioactive material would result in no observable health effects in Ireland. Possible scenarios, or combinations thereof, considered by the PRA Team in reaching this conclusion included natural phenomena including earthquakes, meteorite strikes and incidents such as airplane crashes, terrorist attacks, explosions, fires, and human error. The PRA also found that some severe incidents at Sellafield/LLWR have the potential to create significant socioeconomic impacts in Ireland, such as loss of tourism and markets for Irish seafood and farm products because of concerns that radioactive materials may be present, despite monitoring data confirming that all food for sale or export complies with limits set to protect consumer health. The Department will now study the Report and use it to feed into Government policies relating to Sellafield and nuclear policy in the UK. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors routine operational discharges from Sellafield, and also monitors developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety generally, and keeps the Government informed of their potential implications for Ireland.</p><p>  I welcome the recent publication of the Report by the UK &#8217;s National Audit Office (NAO) <i>Nuclear Decommissioning Authority &#8211; Managing risk reduction at Sellafield</i>. Particularly given Ireland&#8217;s longstanding concerns in relation to Sellafield, I believe it is important that the Sellafield site and its operations are subject to regular, independent scrutiny, such as that undertaken in the preparation of the NAO Report. I also welcome the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority statement that it will continue to work to improve capability and performance at the site.  Ireland must continue to be vigilant in relation to Sellafield as work to decommission the site over the lifetime of the &#8220;Sellafield Plan&#8221; continues. It is critical from an Irish perspective that the UK decommissioning of the site is undertaken safely and in accordance with best international practice. I look forward to the continued timely sharing of key information with the UK Authorities in the future on nuclear matters.</p></reply>

The related Technical Guidance Document B (TGD-B) provides guidance on how compliance with the legal requirement of Part B can be achieved in practice.</p><p>  In addition to the above, the Department in 2002 commissioned an independent study on the use of timber frame housing in Irish conditions which, following public consultation, was published in December 2003. The study included recommendations which have since been implemented in relation to the development of standards and on-site quality assurance procedures.  A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is currently required before construction work commences on new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks and extensions to or material alterations/changes of use of existing buildings. The FSC is issued by the Building Control Authority and certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations.</p><p>  The Building Control Act 1990 places responsibility for compliance with the building Regulations firmly on the owners, builders and designers of building works. Implementation and enforcement of the building control system is a matter for the local building control authority. The Department has no function in assessing, checking or testing compliance, or otherwise, of specific works or developments.</p><p>  While the Department produces annual housing statistics, it is not possible to isolate timber framed apartment buildings as referred to in the question. The Act of 1990 does however require each Building Control Authority to maintain a statutory register of building activity within its functional area. The statutory register must include details of commencement notices, describing the nature and scale of the building works involved, together with details of the Fire Safety Certificate, where relevant, and any other statutory building control processed concerning the building in question. These registers are available for public viewing.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009-2012 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website: </p><p>  While there is no reference in the Regulations to a lower income limit threshold for mortgage applicants, the associated credit policy provides a procedure for calculating the maximum amount of mortgage repayments permissible as a percentage of the household income. Local authorities are advised to examine each application on its own merits in determining whether an applicant is eligible for a house purchase loan. It is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased since the credit policy was introduced. However, it is also clear that the loans issued under that credit policy are more likely to be fully performing.  I consider that the current arrangements for mortgage lending are fair and adequately meet the needs of prospective home owners in a prudent manner.</p><p>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme, the terms provide that rent charged on the local authority&#8217;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&#8217;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude early next year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p></reply>

The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose grants.  General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.</p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 29 November 2012 some &euro;111.2m had been collected nationally.  A reduction of some &euro;15.7m was applied to the third quarter general purpose grant payment. In the final quarter of the year those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% or above have not had a further reduction in their general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% have incurred a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% have incurred a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.  For those authorities with a collection rate below 65%, and thereby incurring a further reduction in quarter 4, the final amount of general purpose grants available for 2012 will be revisited and reviewed at end year to take account of the financial position at that stage, including progress on securing an increased household charge yield.

The administration of the scheme, including the detailed appraisal of new projects and the certification that proposals comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme, is the responsibility of the relevant housing authority. Funding is also allocated to housing authorities on an annual basis under the Social Housing Investment Programme and includes a provision to meet existing commitments for projects that are underway under CAS.</p><p>  Future funding for my Department&rsquo;s programmes and initiatives will be considered in the overall context of the annual Estimates process.  All decisions in this regard will seek to maximise protection and prioritisation of front line services and support to customers and beneficiaries.

These regulations set out the matters that housing authorities must deal with in their allocation schemes. My intention is to put a greater emphasis on "time on the list" as a criterion for allocating local authority housing, which I believe is the most transparent way to operate a waiting list. This review will be advanced in the context of the broader and demanding programme of reform in respect of social housing provision.</p></reply>

The details of this scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie.</p><p>  There is no provision at present for the purchase of individual houses by tenants of approved housing bodies. My Department is currently in consultation with the approved housing body sector regarding the development of an enabling regulatory framework to support the expanded role for the sector as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement.  I expect that this framework will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners and will underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.  In conjunction with the development of this framework, my Department will examine a range of issues around the long-term financing of the sector. How best to use the equity accrued in approved housing body housing stock to, for instance, leverage additional new supply will be considered; the sale of existing stock to tenants is one of a range of options in this regard.  </p></reply>

A public consultation on a draft plan was publicised by the Agency on 11 October 2012.  The submissions received are currently being reviewed by the Agency with a view to finalising the Plan.  A training course for the water services authority personnel who will be appointed to carry out inspections under the new legislation is also currently being finalised and this is being overseen by the Water Services Training Group.  I understand that the Plan and the training course will be finalised shortly. The training course for inspectors will be extended to suitably qualified local authority staff in early 2013.  This will be followed by the commencement of inspections, which will be based on the national inspection plan.</p><p>Since enactment of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 I have made a number of regulations to give effect to the provisions of the primary legislation including the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012 which <i>inter alia, </i>set out the requirements for the operation and maintenance of treatment systems. The implementation of all regulations is kept under on-going review. I have no plans at present to make any amendments to the provisions of the Regulations made to date.  The Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Registration) Regulations 2012 prescribe 1 February 2013 as the date by which owners of domestic wastewater treatment systems must register their systems.  Registration facilities have been available since 26 June 2012.  I have no plans to amend the date specified in the legislation.</p><p>Since June 2012, a public awareness campaign, which included the nationwide delivery of an information booklet to unsewered households, has helped to inform owners of domestic waste water treatment systems of their legal obligations to register their systems and to operate and maintain their systems so as not to cause a risk to human health or the environment. Prior to inspections commencing in 2013, an extensive information campaign to advise householders of how to comply with the legal requirements regarding operation and maintenance of on-site waste water treatment systems will be undertaken.</p><p>As of 29 November, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 226,156 owners, who have registered on-line, by post or in person at their local authority offices, have been processed. I understand that more than 60,000 registration applications are awaiting processing by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  In total, therefore, some 290,000 householders have already applied for registration of their waste water treatment systems.  Census 2011 recorded that there are 497,281 households served by septic tanks or other treatment systems in Ireland.</p><p>Details of the numbers of processed registrations for each County and City Council are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Water Services Authority</font></th><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Estimated total number of </font>on-site waste water treatment systems</th><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Number of </font>on-site waste water treatment systems<font color="#2F2F2F"> registered</font></th><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Number of </font>on-site waste water treatment systems<font color="#2F2F2F"> registered as a percentage of the estimated total number </font></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td><div>7190</div></td><td>3448</td><td><div>48%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td><div>14477</div></td><td>7566</td><td><div>52%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td><div>19769</div></td><td>13122</td><td><div>66%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td><div>586</div></td><td>307</td><td><div>52%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td><div>57993</div></td><td>22995</td><td><div>40%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td><div>32955</div></td><td>8377</td><td><div>25%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td><div>2718</div></td><td>66</td><td><div>2%</div></td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</td><td><div>1928</div></td><td>656</td><td><div>34%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td><div>5213</div></td><td>1734</td><td><div>33%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td><div>1145</div></td><td>403</td><td><div>35%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td><div>42161</div></td><td>16894</td><td><div>40%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td><div>28277</div></td><td>18082</td><td><div>64%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td><div>16795</div></td><td>7764</td><td><div>46%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td><div>15368</div></td><td>8163</td><td><div>53%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td><div>11309</div></td><td>5617</td><td><div>50%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td><div>7005</div></td><td>3464</td><td><div>49%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City Council</td><td><div>420</div></td><td>136</td><td><div>32%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County Council</td><td><div>24207</div></td><td>9886</td><td><div>41%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td><div>7556</div></td><td>4285</td><td><div>57%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td><div>11633</div></td><td>4012</td><td><div>34%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td><div>26659</div></td><td>11631</td><td><div>44%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td><div>21687</div></td><td>11493</td><td><div>53%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td><div>12065</div></td><td>4769</td><td><div>40%</div></td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary County Council</td><td><div>12342</div></td><td>5726</td><td><div>46%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td><div>11170</div></td><td>4945</td><td><div>44%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td><div>14297</div></td><td>7459</td><td><div>52%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td><div>11192</div></td><td>5517</td><td><div>49%</div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td><div>2266</div></td><td>665</td><td><div>29%</div></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary County Council</td><td><div>14442</div></td><td>6945</td><td><div>48%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City Council</td><td><div>488</div></td><td>232</td><td><div>48%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council</td><td><div>11466</div></td><td>4724</td><td><div>41%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td><div>12165</div></td><td>5865</td><td><div>48%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td><div>26267</div></td><td>12327</td><td><div>47%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td><div>12070</div></td><td>6881</td><td><div>57%</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This strategy sets out the main policy and strategic objectives to be achieved over time and provides a focus for the delivery of outdoor recreation facilities and services.  In addition, the development of such facilities and services provides a significant boost to local communities by encouraging both national and international activity tourists. Consequently there are enhanced opportunities for rural communities to benefit from local enterprise development and enhanced opportunities for small scale businesses.</p><p>  The significant development with regard to the implementation of policy in this area has been a change in the contractual arrangements with the Local Development Companies (LDC) contracted to deliver the Walks Scheme. The Walks Scheme is closed to new entrants due to budgetary constraints. However, the LDCs are now also contracted to deliver on the implementation of the NCRS in extended geographic areas.  This means that some companies now provide services over the full county area and some provide advice and support to adjacent counties also.  The change in focus from the delivery of the Walks Scheme only to the delivery of the full range of outdoor recreation opportunities and activities will further enhance the attraction of our rural areas and accelerate developments in all areas of recreation.</p><p>  My Department is currently in negotiations with other State Agencies to agree a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland. The Department continues to be a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors. It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibly in the outdoors and to do their part to protect  lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.  A Pilot Mountain Access Scheme is being implemented.  It is intended to facilitate access to uplands for hill walking and similar activities.  A pilot project has been developed at Mount Gable in Connemara and discussions are continuing towards extending another proposed pilot project for Carrantuohill to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks in County Kerry. </p><p>  My Department is currently supporting the State Claims Agency in the establishment of a Visitor Safety in the Countryside Group who will use best practice to aim to achieve a safe and pleasant experience for outdoor enthusiasts and visitors to the countryside.  The possibility of implementing a National Indemnity Scheme  is also being examined; while the Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, this would indemnify all private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property.</p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.  The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p><p>  The development of the programme followed a comprehensive review of investment requirements initiated in 2009 involving an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services by each water services authority and taking account of reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.</p><p>  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs. There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment. In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure. An implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water has been finalised. This strategy takes account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition, that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects and that a sustainable funding model is put in place to support increased investment in the sector. </p></reply>

A number of companies and consultancies have developed testing protocols to meet their own particular needs with the costs varying from &euro;1,000 to &euro;5,000 depending on the complexities of the tests involved. In asking the NSAI to undertake work in relation to the development of a protocol for testing and categorisation, it was made aware of the Panel&rsquo;s view, with which I concur, that the protocol should be sufficiently comprehensive to allow for the categorisation of dwellings, but should also be cost effective to reduce the financial burden on householders.</p><p>  I understand that the technical committee established by NSAI to assist with the development of the testing and categorisation protocol is a broad based committee which draw s on the expertise on pyrite developed in Ireland over the past five years to establish testing and categorisation criteria.  NSAI has launched a period of public enquiry from the 27 of November 2012 until the 17 December 2012 in respect of I.S. 398: Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol and I.S. 398: Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works.  This facilitates the submission by the public of comment on the draft protocol which will be considered by the relevant committee before final decisions are made.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Referendum Acts the costs of running a referendum are met by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund on the request of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the costs of the Referendum Commission are met by the Department sponsoring the constitutional amendment Bill.</p><p>  On the question of spending by Government Departments it is a matter for each Department to ensure that expenditure is only incurred in accordance with public financial procedures. The provision of sanction, either specific or delegated, for voted expenditure is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and it is the responsibility of each Department to ensure that only expenditure covered by sanction is incurred.</p><p>  On the matter of the day of the week on which referendums are held, whenever a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, I am required under section 10 of the Referendum Act 1994 to appoint the day upon which the poll at the referendum shall take place.  The Act allows for the taking of the poll on any day of the week and this flexibility allows all relevant factors to be taken into account at any given time in setting the polling day.  While I have no proposals to change the current arrangements for the holding of referendums they are kept under review in my Department in the light of all relevant developments.</p><p>  In the meantime the Electoral (Amendment) (Referendum Spending and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is on the Government&rsquo;s legislation programme, will be progressed. This Bill will provide for the disclosure of expenditure and donations at referendum campaigns and for the extension of the spending limit period that applies at Presidential, D&aacute;il, European Parliament and local elections.</p></reply>

It includes a n example specification (Annex E) for unbound granular fill for use under concrete floors and paths and limits the total sulphur content to 1%.  The example specification sets out verifiable performance criteria for hardcore.  It sets the quality of the aggregate (attempting to rule out low quality stone), the grading (reducing the level of fines) and the results required from sulphur-related chemical tests.  If the value of total sulphur con tent during initial testing is less than 0.1%, no further testing is required, unless there is a significant change in the quarry deposit. However, if the result is between 0.1 and 1%, there is a risk of swelling from pyrite, and it is advised that a suitably experienced petrographer carry out a detailed mineralogical examination to establish: (a) the material&rsquo;s suitability as hardcore under floors and footpaths, and (b) an appropriate testing frequency for total sulphur based on the variability of the quarry deposit.</p><p>  The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including houses and extensions. Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provides guidance on how compliance can be achieved in practice. TDG D (Materials and Workmanship) requires that all works are carried out with proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended. More specifically, TGD C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) require s that hardcore conform with I.S. EN 1342:2002 and meet the specification in Annex E of SR21. In this regard, the Pyrite Panel noted in its report that there are no reported instances of dwellings commenced after 2007 which became the subject of pyrite related claims to structural guarantee providers.</p><p>  Responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owner and /or the builder and the onus is on the builder to ensure that the infill material he is using meets the requirements set out Standard Recommendation (SR) 21.  The recently published pyrite report contains a recommendation on the development of a standalone specification for hardcore which will require quarries to put in place robust testing and traceability procedures.</p></reply>

The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March 2012. This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.  The collection of the Household Charge is under the care and management of local authorities. I urge any liable person who is having difficulty making payment of the Charge to contact their local authority. </p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public wastewater infrastructure is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme. </p><p>  The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;1 billion in relation to wastewater infrastructure. This includes contracts to ensure compliance with the both the Water Framework and Urban Wastewater Treatment Directives, and to meet forecasted increases in demand. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.  In the period, 2000 to 2011 (inclusive), over &#8364;5.5 billion has been invested in the water services sector; this led, inter alia,<i></i>to an increase in wastewater treatment capacity to a level equivalent to the needs of a population of over 3.9 million.</p><p>  Funding is also available under my Department&#8217;s Rural Water Programme towards works on small public wastewater schemes and group sewerage schemes.  Responsibility for the administration of this Programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual schemes for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocations provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.</p><p>  In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure. An implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water has been finalised. This strategy takes account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition, that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects and that a sustainable funding model is put in place to support increased investment in the sector.</p></reply>

An explosion occurred within a private house in this development in March 2012, one of a terrace of six houses. Subsequently, Longford County Council established an expert steering group and appointed a firm of consulting engineers to investigate the cause of the explosion. A second explosion occurred in this development at the beginning of October.</p><p>  The specific findings of this report have been made available to residents of the terrace in Gleann Riada as well as general advice to other residents in the estate.

Services managed by the Chief Fire Officers includes a broad range of duties and functions: fire services response; fire prevention work, including community fire safety; requirements under SEVESO/COMAH and Dangerous Substances legislation; the Building Control and dangerous buildings functions; leading major emergency management within the local government system and in the inter-agency regional structures; running mobilisation and communication centres as well as training centres on a regional basis; liaising with and in some cases running the Civil Defence service; and making input to national policy development and delivery.</p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was established in 2009 to provide central leadership and direction to fire and emergency management in Ireland and to achieve consistent, effective and value for money fire services delivered by local fire authorities . T   he National Directorate is headed by a National Director who effectively performs the role of a National Chief Fire Officer.</p><p>The National Directorate has developed a policy document called <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS) which is intended to set the future direction of fire services in Ireland. KCS is the outcome of a review of fire services activities, and it will address, inter alia, future roles and appropriate structures to deliver services effectively and efficiently. I expect to publish it shortly as national policy.  The National Directorate is headed by a National Director who effectively performs the role of a National Chief Fire Officer.

The new regulations will provide, among other things, for the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met in relation to the building concerned. Drawings and particulars demonstrating compliance must also be submitted to the local building control authority. In addition a building owner will be required to assign a registered professional to inspect the work during construction and also to certify that the completed building is in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.</p><p>  I believe that the measures outlined above are key steps necessary to strengthen the building control system and will be capable of delivering a stronger level of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations and a better quality of homes and buildings.</p></reply>

The new service would be provided using a new Housing Assistance Payment [HAP]. The new assistance payment [HAP] would be paid on the tenants&rsquo; behalf directly to the landlord within a stronger regulatory framework. Under HAP the rental contribution from tenants will be set by reference to the differential rent for the area. It is also intended that some form of automated deduction of rental payments from DSP payments would also be available for HAP and other social housing tenancies.  The County and City Managers Association (CCMA) is represented on the Steering Group for this project.  In that context the CCMA is providing necessary input, as required, into how local authorities will operate and resource HAP.</p></reply>

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>  There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing the Local Property Tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.</p><p>  I understand that the addresses and names used in the batch of letters which have been issued by Local Authorities in recent weeks reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. I also understand that in excess of 500,000 letters have been issued on foot of this exercise. However, individual local authorities are also working to identify and contact liable owners who have yet to pay the Charge.  As such, it is not possible to state the exact number of persons who have been contacted by the Agency and local authorities for non-payment of the Household Charge. Nor, in the absence of a comprehensive database of all liable properties and their payment status, is it possible to state the total volume of unpaid liabilities, including late payment fees and interest.  The question of prosecutions is a matter for the relevant local authority; however, I understand that several legal actions are underway.</p></reply>

To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &#8364;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &#8364;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition <font color="#FF0000">. </font>In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received twelve applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded status to four bodies. The Agency has approved five applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &#8364;13.4 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2013, under this Scheme, with more approved housing bodies applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.</p><p>  I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA.</p><p>  No funding restrictions have been placed on local authorities for the purposes of providing loan finance for house purchase or home improvement. Allocations totalling over &#8364;55m issued to local authorities for House Purchase and House Improvement lending in April 2012, an increase of 8% on the 2011 allocation of &#8364;51m. These allocations represent borrowings ceilings rather than financial provisions.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.</p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. The transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.</p><p>  The level of ambition for next year under mortgage to rent and the prospective associated mortgage to lease arrangements will be determined largely in the context of the Estimates process for 2013. It will be essential to deal with any potential displacement effect for other categories of social housing need arising as a result of the wider roll-out of mortgage to rent.</p></reply>

Expenditure at the end of October was behind profile due to the decision to defer a number of projects, mainly in the area of architectural services.  It is likely that these savings will continue to year-end.</p><p>  The focus for capital investment in 2013 and beyond will be on protecting previous investments in infrastructure such as embassy property, vehicles, ICT networks and the Passport Service.  There is a need for significant investment in the Passport Service, including the need to renew some of large-scale passport production equipment which is approaching &ldquo;end-of-life&rdquo;.  This investment forms part of a wider programme to enhance the Passport Service, and my Department is finalising a comprehensive proposal on the matter.  As well as renewing the production equipment, the development of services such as Adult on-line renewal will require capital investment in at least 2013 and 2014. As the likely cost is greater than the allocation foreseen for those years, my Department will work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to finding a cost-effective method of providing the investment.</p></reply>

This first comprehensive root and branch review of its operations since 1964 forms part of the wider World Bank agenda for modernization to better respond to today&rsquo;s complex set of development objectives.  Ireland strongly supports the core principles of a modern procurement policy at the Bank: the need for economy and efficiency, the interest in ensuring that all eligible bidders have equal opportunity to compete, the desire to encourage the development of domestic industries and the importance of having a transparent procurement process.</p><p>  World Bank procurement has changed significantly over recent decades from stand alone large infrastructure programmes to sector wide approaches and community based activities. The result is that supplying countries for Bank-financed operations are increasingly developing countries. A larger share of contracts awarded by international competitive bidding are now also won by companies in developing countries. This is good for local business in developing economies and is an indication of strengthening capacities in the private sector.</p><p>  Ireland will actively engage with the World Bank in this ongoing review to ensure its procurement policies and practises are complimentary to the World Bank&rsquo;s larger goal of improving development effectiveness by encouraging the use of country systems and harmonization, building competitive local industries, strengthening public sector management, improving governance and anticorruption, promoting sustainability, accelerating investment in infrastructure, and deepening international trade.  We will work with the Bank to ensure the new guidelines pay greater attention to borrowing countries&rsquo; implementation capacity, and, where appropriate, include capacity building programmes to develop local procurement capacities, especially in fragile and conflict affected states.</p></reply>

I also welcome the Bank&rsquo;s commitment to consider in this review process a number of areas that are not addressed under the current set of safeguard policies. These new areas include human rights, labour and occupational health and safety, gender, disability, the free, prior, and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples, land tenure and natural resources, and climate change.</p><p>  Ireland along with other like-minded shareholders will actively engage with the Bank in this review process to ensure that the Bank&rsquo;s next generation of environmental and social safeguards will serve to protect people, including the most vulnerable, the environment to ensure sustainable development outcomes based on the development needs of countries and their communities and, in particular, human rights to the highest possible standards.</p></reply>

We are particularly concerned about developments in relation to the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which was presented as a private member&rsquo;s Bill, and is currently under consideration at committee level in the Ugandan Parliament.    The EU, along with other international partners, has engaged actively on this issue, in a coordinated manner, since it first arose in 2009.  The EU continues to advocate strongly against the adoption of the proposed law and EU Ambassadors in Kampala, including the Ambassador of Ireland, outlined their serious concerns in a recent meeting with the Prime Minister of Uganda.  The regular structured EU political dialogue with the Government of Uganda also provides an important opportunity to highlight our concerns in relation to the proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill directly.</p><p>  In addition to the coordinated EU response to the proposed law, Ireland has highlighted the matter bilaterally with Ugandan authorities. I raised the issue directly with the President when I visited the country in July and I asked our Ambassador in Kampala to continue to follow developments closely.  Our Embassy in Kampala has consistently made the case to the Government of Uganda, at all levels, that the passing of any such legislation would be in conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s international human rights obligations and would have a detrimental effect on the country&rsquo;s relations with its international development partners, including Ireland. The position of the Government of Uganda on the Bill is that it is not part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme and President Museveni has made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&rsquo;s international relations and reputation.</p><p>  We, along with our partners in the EU, remain committed to ensuring that the citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue monitor developments closely in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multifaceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p><p>  With regard to the Meath area in particular the Revenue enforcement teams have been and will continue to be active in markets, in visiting retail outlets and other commercial premises, and in pursuing those selling door to door.  In November 2012 these teams had meetings with Garda Sergeants for the Meath area and with local traders to discuss ways in which they can support each other in identifying illicit cigarette and tobacco traders and outlets.  The enforcement teams are active in gathering their own intelligence regarding those involved in the sale of illicit tobacco products in the Meath area and will continue to follow up on any information received and to seize illicit product and to prosecute those engaged in illegal trading in tobacco products.</p><p>  The illegal trade in tobacco is a serious threat to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses and the Deputy can be assured that Revenue will continue their work against smugglers and sellers of illicit tobacco products.</p></reply>

From January 2013, Revenue will introduce a new requirement that all licensed fuel traders make monthly returns of fuel movements and transactions.  These new control measures will make it more difficult for criminals to source marked fuel for laundering or to put laundered fuel on the market.  </p><p>  In addition, Revenue is working closely with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs in the UK to tackle the problem on a co-ordinated basis.  As part of this process, in June 2012, Revenue and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs issued jointly an &#8216;Invitation to Make Submissions&#8217; on a new and more effective marker for rebated fuel that could be implemented in both jurisdictions.  The invitation yielded a very satisfactory number of responses by the closing date of 30 November and these will be evaluated jointly early in the new year.  </p><p>  The measures implemented to date by Revenue have produced very positive results.  Over the last two years, over 70 filling stations have been closed, over two million litres of fuel have been seized and 20 oil laundries have been detected and closed.  Revenue is confident that these measures, including those commencing in 2013, will have a significant further impact on illicit fuel operations.</p></reply>

The IBEC proposal is being examined as outlined in my reply.  The circumstances outlined in the &#8220;details supplied&#8221; with this question appear to relate to the options available to an individual to access pension benefits where the pension fund is relatively small.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under Revenue rules relating to the commutation of trivial pensions there is no objection where the scheme trustees and the beneficiary agree to the payment of once-off pensions at the point of retirement in certain circumstances.  This may take place where the total of all funds available for pension benefits, following payment of any lump sum benefit, is less than &#8364;20,000.  Prior Revenue approval is not required.  The quantum of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the &#8364;20,000 limit.<i></i> The rates of tax and PRSI to be applied to the commuted amount are those that apply to any other pension payment. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that the website relating to the Pension Scheme mentioned in the &#8220;details supplied&#8221; advises scheme members of the foregoing commutation option at retirement.  Given that the individual concerned took a lump sum on retirement and is now in receipt of a small monthly pension payment, it can only be assumed that he did not meet the necessary conditions to avail of the full commutation option at that time.  Once pension benefits in the form of a pension or annuity have commenced to be paid there is no facility for an individual to seek to have the future stream of payments commuted. </p></reply>

The fund closed its fundraising on 3 May 2007 at which time a total of approximately &euro;128 million had been committed by investors to the fund. The number of customers involved has not been publicly disclosed.  The fund was sold to investors through a process that complied with the relevant regulatory requirements, at that time.  From the outset, the fund was clearly highlighted in the relevant documentation as being a high risk geared investment.  The terms and conditions of the fund, including the associated risks of the fund were outlined in the Information Memorandum.  The fund provides a detailed update, including audited financial statements, to its investors each year.  AIB has also informed me that it does not disclose details of its arrangements or discussions with individual customers.  However, if an investor is not satisfied with any aspect of the manner in which the fund was sold to them, they have the option to refer the matter to the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman for an independent adjudication.  AIB is supportive of this process.</p></reply>

That section sets out the various actions that constitute offences of evasion or attempted evasion of excise duty, as well as the penalties, by way of a fine or imprisonment, for such offences.  Where a conviction for an offence under section 119 occurs following a summary prosecution, the fine that may be imposed is &euro;5,000.  A Court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, either instead of or in addition to the fine.  For convictions following prosecution on indictment, the applicable fine is an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, where the value of the tobacco products concerned is greater than &euro;250,000, not exceeding three times the value of the products.  The Court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, as an alternative, or in addition, to the fine.</p><p>  Section 78 of the Finance Act 2005 includes penalties for the illegal sale of tobacco products.  A Court may, following a summary conviction, impose a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  The penalty following conviction on indictment is a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment.  The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the Courts. Section 130(2) of the Finance Act, 2001 permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount so mitigated is not greater than 50% of the amount of the fine.  </p><p>  The fines for excise offences have been increased in the recent past; those that apply in the event of conviction on indictment were increased substantially by the Finance Act 2010.  The need for further changes will be kept under review, taking account, among other considerations, of practical experience of the operation of the increased fines.</p></reply>

Pension benefits for those who were members of the scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary.  The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme.  The NTMA contribution to the scheme is determined on the advice of an independent actuary and is at present set at a level of 25% of payroll in respect of members prior to 1 January 2010 and 10.5% of payroll in respect of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010.</p><p>  Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.  Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme.  The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p><p>  In relation to the pension entitlements of the Chief Executive of the NTMA, his contract provides that his pension will be based not on his salary as Chief Executive but on his salary as a director of the NTMA prior to his appointment as Chief Executive.  The pension of the Chief Executive of NAMA will ultimately be based on a pro-rata average of his final salary as NAMA Chief Executive and his final salary as an employee of the NTMA.  He was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of NAMA on 22 December 2009 and his contract as NAMA Chief Executive is a specified purpose contract, linked to the lifespan of NAMA.</p><p>  The Chief Executives of NTMA and NAMA have waived 15% of salary through the gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under Section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under this provision does not affect the calculation of pension benefits.  The salary of the Chief Executive of NTMA for 2011 was &euro;490,000 before the voluntary reduction.  The salary of the Chief Executive of NAMA for 2011 was &euro;430,000 before the voluntary reduction.  The public service Pension-Related Deduction is applied to the Chief Executives of the NTMA and NAMA&quot;.</p></reply>

Payment by credit card may also be made by telephone and the transaction charge in respect of such payments is 1.69%.  The transaction charge is purely in respect of fees incurred by Revenue in the provision of the service.</p></reply>

A distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners, for example single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children.  A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various budgetary options. Illustrative examples are contained in the Budget 2012 document.  The Deputy might also be aware that an analysis of the impact of the 9% VAT rate introduced as part of last years Jobs Initiative was published in the recent Medium-Term Fiscal Statement. </p><p>  As part of the broader budgetary framework reform measures, the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) was introduced in 2011 as a line by line examination of public expenditure.  In particular, it was sought to identify means of reducing expenditure, while minimising the impact on service delivery.  The expenditure submissions prepared by Departments as well as other cross cutting thematic papers have been published on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website.  These give more detail on the analysis underpinning the final expenditure ceilings.  The ongoing work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service also supports Departments in evaluating policy and expenditure options.  The central expenditure evaluation unit, CEEU, within<font color="#2020A0"> </font>the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform promotes best practice in the evaluation of programme expenditure across all Departments and public sector agencies.</p><p>  The primary objective of Budget 2012 was to reduce further the deficit in our public finances in line with our commitments, since it is not sustainable to continue running such large deficits.  On the basis of the most recent data available, it appears that we will meet our deficit targets for 2012.  The Government sought to implement the measures required to reduce the deficit in a manner that was as fair and equitable as possible and in a manner that would protect the emerging economic recovery.</p></reply>

As IBRC is wholly owned by the State, any future return to the State will be by way of dividends from IBRC or from the projected final net asset position for IBRC.  IBRC provides details of their outstanding liabilities in their published accounts.  This cumulative figure amounted to &euro;50.4bn at 30 June 2012 including &euro;45.2bn representing sale and repurchase agreements with banks and central banks.  This amount will have to be repaid over time, mainly from annual instalments on the promissory notes.  The realisable value on the remaining IBRC loan book (&euro;15.6bn at 30 June 2012) will also be used to reduce this liability over time.  The amount of money required by IBRC to repay total liabilities (including these sale and repurchase agreements) is subject to material uncertainty and market factors which include the expected timing of asset recoveries and sales (themselves dependant on property prices, especially in the UK and Ireland); the volume and timing of maturing funding commitments and deposits; and projected interest rates within the Eurozone.</p><p>The bank&rsquo;s policy is that, due to the commercially sensitive nature of such information as noted above, combined with the many external variables involved, it does not issue formal projections.  However, I can point out that the Chairman of IBRC stated recently at the Oireachtas Committee for Finance and Public Expenditure that he hopes the final bill for Anglo Irish Bank, &ldquo;will come nearer to &euro;25 billion than the &euro;29 billion to &euro;34 billion figure&rdquo;, previously announced.  The bank remains of the view that there will be a small return to the State at full resolution, given the assumptions currently being used.</p><p>In relation to inclusion of interest in the projected ultimate outturn, I have been advised that in calculating the projected final net asset position, IBRC take into account interest from all assets including customers, securities and promissory notes.</p><p>An interest holiday was inserted into each of the promissory notes which meant that between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 no interest was payable.  While there was an interest holiday this does not affect the promissory note repayments of the principal amount.  The cash flows on the promissory notes are 10% (&euro;3.06billion) of the original amount per annum until the full amount is repaid.  Set out below is a detailed aggregated schedule of capital repayments and interest payments on the promissory notes.</p><p><b>Promissory Note Schedule</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>&#8364;bn</div></th><th><div>Total interest  <br />Paid: A</div></th><th><div>Total Capital Reduction: B</div></th><th><div>Repayments:<br />A + B</div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>31/03/2011</td><td><div>            0.55 </div></td><td><div>              2.51 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2012</td><td><div>               -   </div></td><td><div>              3.06 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2013</td><td><div>            0.49 </div></td><td><div>              2.57 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2014</td><td><div>            1.84 </div></td><td><div>              1.22 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2015</td><td><div>            1.75 </div></td><td><div>              1.31 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2016</td><td><div>            1.65 </div></td><td><div>              1.41 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2017</td><td><div>            1.55 </div></td><td><div>              1.51 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2018</td><td><div>            1.44 </div></td><td><div>              1.62 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2019</td><td><div>            1.32 </div></td><td><div>              1.74 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2020</td><td><div>            1.19 </div></td><td><div>              1.87 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2021</td><td><div>            1.06 </div></td><td><div>              2.00 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2022</td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td><div>              2.15 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2023</td><td><div>            0.75 </div></td><td><div>              2.31 </div></td><td><div>            3.06 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2024</td><td><div>            0.57 </div></td><td><div>              1.52 </div></td><td><div>            2.09 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2025</td><td><div>            0.45 </div></td><td><div>              0.47 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2026</td><td><div>            0.39 </div></td><td><div>              0.52 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2027</td><td><div>            0.33 </div></td><td><div>              0.58 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2028</td><td><div>            0.26 </div></td><td><div>              0.65 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2029</td><td><div>            0.19 </div></td><td><div>              0.73 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2030</td><td><div>            0.10 </div></td><td><div>              0.81 </div></td><td><div>            0.91 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31/03/2031</td><td><div>            0.01 </div></td><td><div>              0.05 </div></td><td><div>            0.05 </div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>            16.8 </div></td><td><div>              30.6 </div></td><td><div>            47.4 </div></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>* These numbers may not tot exactly as a result of rounding</p><p>** The March 2012 repayment was settled with a long term Government bond.</p></reply>

As these securities are freely tradable once issued it is not possible to trace their ultimate ownership.  These securities are traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems.  An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house.  At maturity, the Bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house who will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records.  Even where the bank is presented with lists alleging to represent names of bondholders I am informed there is no way for the bank or anyone else to completely verify the accuracy of such lists.</p><p>  Therefore, I can confirm that the only accurate record of the holders of such bonds is the initial purchasers of the specific bond issuance.  Regarding the levels of insurance undertaken by individual holders of bonds in the Irish covered banks, speculating as to how individual bondholders might mitigate against the different risks associated with managing their portfolios is not an area I can advise the Deputy on.</p></reply>

Tax relief on interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out in the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2012 will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. However, tax relief is not available on interest paid on loans taken out on or after 1 January 2013. This means that only the interest paid on monies drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 will qualify for tax relief.  I have no plans to review this decision and I believe that more than adequate notice of this decision has been provided.  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The Universal Social Charge is an individualised charge and as such, the estimate of yield is based on individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000.    The estimated yield is based on confining the extension of the 3% rate to the portion of income which is in excess of &euro;100,000, that is, the increase is not applied to the portion of total income earned up to &euro;100,000. </p><p>  The effect of the suggested change on effective tax rates of income tax and USC would vary depending on the income level, ranging from increases of approximately 0.14% at &euro;105,000 to 1.5% at &euro;200,000. The overall average increase in the effective rate for the income range &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000 is ultimately decided by the distribution of income earner numbers in the range. As the population distribution is predominantly skewed towards the lower end of that income range the overall average increase in the effective rate emerges as 0.3%.  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. It is, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</p></reply>

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions. A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer   from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to &euro;70,000 and confining tax relief to the standard rate of 30% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &euro;330 million. </p></reply>

Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.</p><p>  As regards calculating the VAT impact of below cost sales of alcohol, separate figures are not available for input VAT on goods that were subsequently sold at a discount as traders&rsquo; VAT returns show only the total input VAT and the total output VAT for the period covered by the return.</p></reply>

No additional revenue would accrue to the Exchequer as a result of such a system because any additional revenue raised would be subject to reclaim by eligible users.  While it might be expected that the net mineral oil tax raised from the users concerned would be neutral, this might not be the case in practice as the risk of abuse and fraud might be greater than is the case with the existing system. A change of this kind would also require the establishment of an extensive repayments system, which would give rise to a significant additional administrative burdens and costs for oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.

This means that a loan will have to be drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 in order to qualify for this relief. I have no plans to review this decision and I believe that more than adequate notice of this decision has been provided.  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

While unlicensed activities are treated very seriously by all of these bodies, their functions in regard to this matter differ. The issue of &ldquo;shutting down premises&rdquo; where a licence has not been renewed on time, or indeed any other breach of the Licensing laws, is a matter for An Garda Siochana.   Revenue does not have power to shut down an unlicensed premise that sells intoxicating liquor. However, Revenue does have the authority to instigate Court proceedings for unlicensed trading when they detect such activity. Where a relevant Court is satisfied that such proceedings are valid then the normal outcome is that a monetary fine will be imposed on the person who engaged in the unlicensed trading. The Courts also have the power to direct for endorsement, temporary closure, or forfeiture in the case of repeated offences.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that their compliance strategies are based on addressing the areas of greatest risk to the Exchequer.  The Revenue Commissioners have a compliance programme in this area, which systematically targets and addresses unlicensed premises and those publicans that fail to renew their licences.</p></reply>

Revenue has a clear focus on making sure that every person and business complies with the requirement to file the relevant returns and to pay the appropriate tax or duty on a timely basis. That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due, adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that tax clearance certificates automatically issue to individuals or businesses that are tax compliant. In circumstances where there are compliance problems in regard to the timely payment of tax then tax clearance certificates are not automatically renewed. In cases where payment of a tax debt in a single lump sum is demonstrably not possible for an individual or business and a tax clearance certificate is required, then the individual or business should contact Revenue and negotiate a mutually acceptable phased payment arrangement. A phased payment arrangement is a concession and must be fully justified to Revenue with reference to the specific circumstances of the individual taxpayer or business. In such phased payment situations where tax clearance is required, a down payment of at least 40% of the debt is normally requested. However, I am informed by Revenue that this level of down payment  can be reduced on a case by case basis depending on the particular circumstances of the case and the willingness of the taxpayer or business to engage with Revenue  to satisfactorily address the outstanding tax debt and to restore timely compliance as quickly as possible.</p><p>  I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails and how this can pose challenges for businesses and individuals in being timely compliant. Revenue has responded to the difficult environment by encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise in order to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. Revenue has, for example, published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website at www.revenue.ie. I commend Revenue for the work that it has done in that regard and in the practical support and assistance it is providing to viable businesses. I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised Revenue&rsquo;s efforts in this regard also.</p></reply>

The Deputy will note that the rate of Stamp Duty on the vast majority of residential properties is 1% compared to a rate of 9% as recently as 2010.</p></reply>

It is the role of Revenue to ensure that all businesses, regardless of the type of activity they are engaged in, are registered for the appropriate taxes and duties, and that they fulfill their obligations with regard to the filing of returns and the payment of taxes.   Revenue has a strong focus on cash businesses, given their potential high-risk nature.  Revenue uses a wide range of approaches to identify those who under-declare their income and/or are operating in the shadow/hidden economy, and deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks.  Activities undertaken can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues, aspect queries on specific compliance issues  as well as full  audits and, where warranted, prosecutions.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that, specifically regarding the retail and wholesale motor vehicle parts and accessories sector (which includes the tyre distributor industry), 25 Audits have been carried out to the end of October 2012, yielding &euro;407,063.  In 2011, 37 audits were carried out in this sector, with a yield of  &euro;483,070.</p><p>  The Commissioners also advise that their tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners advise that they hold meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow/hidden economy activities are evaluated.  Furthermore, the Commissioners advise that they are willing to meet with any party interested in passing on specific insights into tax evasion, and that all such information received will be followed up on, but for reasons of confidentiality Revenue will not be in a position to provide any specific feedback on information received.</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two recent examples are the introduction of a more robust Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.</p></reply>

The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 was enacted in July of this year and work is now underway to establish the Board which will operate the Fund.   The legislation followed a comprehensive consultation process which included a Freefone Service operated by Barnardos on behalf of my Department.</p><p>  I would also point out that it was envisaged from the outset that the contributions sought from the congregations would be used towards the costs of the response to residential institutional abuse which have been mainly borne by the taxpayer.  I am satisfied that the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund will help meet the range of needs of former residents and I am pursuing its establishment at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

In 2012 my Department has provided support to the value of approximately &euro;740,000 to this School.  The provision includes staffing of an Administrative Principal, 6 teachers and 5 child care workers catering for 95 children, a pupil to adult ratio of approximately 8:1. In addition to the teaching and child care provision, the project receives an annual grant from my Department to fund non-teaching pay costs which provides for the employment of a cook, cleaner and a caretaker. My Department also provides funding towards the non-pay or running costs of the project.  Finally, I wish to clarify that the funding awarded to the Project is based on budget proposals submitted by the project each year. The funding awarded by my Department for 2012 matches the proposals submitted.</p></reply>

All participating higher education institutions have received a pre-financing payment of 80% of their grant allocation.  The balance of 21% of the budget is usually paid by the European Commission to the national agency in March/April of each year.  On receipt of this payment, the national agency makes the final payment of 20% to the institutions.<br />  On 26 November 2012, Androulla Vassiliou, Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth stated that:<br />&quot;The situation surrounding Erasmus [and the Lifelong Learning Programme] is now very serious. Unless there is a rapid response to the request for additional funding credits for 2012 which the Commission adopted on 23 October, the Commission will start 2013 owing reimbursements of about &euro;220 million to the national agencies for the expenses incurred in 2012.  The Commission's intention was to reimburse this backlog from 2013 funds, thereby at least securing funding for current and further Erasmus mobilities in early 2013. This would, however, come at the cost of further depleting 2013 funds, setting the scene for substantial and real problems in the second half of the year.&quot;<br />  To date, the Irish national agency is not aware of any immediately damaging impact on Irish participation levels. Should funding not be forthcoming, however, that situation could change for those currently on mobility and for those planning to travel in 2013.</p></reply>

Within that framework common policies in four designated areas of co-operation are developed and co-ordinated: special education needs, educational underachievement, teacher mobility, and school, youth, and teacher exchanges. Details of recent progress under each of these headings are set out below.</p><p>  Special Education NeedsBoth administrations continue to work together to ensure the agreed expansion of the Middletown Centre for Autism, Co. Armagh is delivered as soon as possible.  A report on the joint inspection of the Centre by the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate and the Education and Training Inspectorate found that the quality of the provision which they evaluated was outstanding. It was found that the Centre is meeting very effectively the needs of the young people, their peers, parents and professionals and has demonstrated its capacity for sustained improvement. Both Education Ministers have welcomed the report as a strong endorsement of the valuable work being carried out by the Centre.</p><p>  Educational UnderachievementThe Educational Underachievement Working Group (EUWG) met on 4 September 2012 to review and advance its work programme. The Working Group reviewed progress on the production of a joint report by the two inspectorates on best practice in literacy and numeracy in post-primary settings and the potential for a similar publication on good practice in supporting those with special educational needs. The EUWG approved a proposal by Children's Books Ireland to encourage young teenagers' involvement in reading. Both Departments supported Maths Week 2012.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has recently notified Departments and public bodies of the mandatory requirement to use central contracts, put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS), when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. These national contracts are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating Departments and agencies to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. Within the Education Sector, the mandatory arrangement relating to stationery currently applies to the Higher Education and VEC Sectors.</p><p>  The NPS is supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) through its education and guidance strategies and many Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks in areas such as stationery, managed print services and ICT consumables. These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.</p><p>  While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, given the budgetary pressures under which we all now operate, savings on the procurement of goods and services across the public sector can go someway to ensure that the level of service provided to the community is greater than it might otherwise be.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.  I will consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received and a further announcement will be made at that stage.</p></reply>

My Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland work closely together in their roles as joint sponsor Departments of the Special EU Programmes Body and as the Departments having member state responsibility for the PEACE III and Interreg IVA Programmes, with regular contact, generally on a daily basis.</p><p>  The PEACE III Programme (2007-2013) is a &euro;333m cross-border programme co-funded by the European Union.    Its aim is to promote reconciliation and to help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland. It funds a wide range of projects from small activities funded under Local Area Peace Plans to the iconic Peace Bridge over the River Foyle.</p><p>  The Interreg IVA Programme (2007-2013) is a &euro;256m cross-border programme co-funded by the EU Union.  The Programme aims to promote economic and social well-being in the eligible region, Northern Ireland, the border counties of Ireland and parts of western Scotland.    The Programme encompasses projects in the enterprise, tourism, health, rural development, public sector collaboration, energy, information and communications technology, energy and transport sectors.</p><p>  The Special EU Programmes Body anticipates that both Programmes will be fully committed by the end of the year.  Both Programmes are overseen by Progamme Management Committees, comprised of government departments, local representatives, community and voluntary sector and social partners.  The work of the Programme Monitoring Committees includes monitoring and evaluation of the PEACE III and INTERREG IVA Programmes and independent evaluations are commissioned for this purpose, on an ex-ante, mid term and ex-post basis.  </p><p>  My Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel have asked the SEUPB to begin the process of preparing programme proposals for the 2014-2020 round of EU programmes.  We have asked the SEUPB to conduct this work on the assumption that there would be a successor programme for both PEACE and Interreg.  I would stress that discussions on new EU programmes and funding are ongoing in Brussels in the context of the negotiation of the Multiannual Financial Framework and that final decisions have not yet been made.  The Irish Government remains committed to a new PEACE Programme, however.</p><p>  The programme preparation process has begun with a consultation process, including public consultation events organised by SEUPB across the eligible region.  Under the guidance of a programme development steering committee representing government departments, local representatives and social partners, the SEUPB will draft programme proposals and a further consultation period will then commence.</p></reply>

Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature.

The Deputy will understand that I do not propose to indicate to the market how much I expect to raise from the sale of any of the assets in the disposal programme, including those of Coillte, but I can assure him that the sales will be transacted via an open, transparent and competitive process.</p></reply>

In making this reply, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to public service pensions, and in particular to the public service pension reduction, or PSPR, which was introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010.</p><p>The fact is that all occupational pensions are earned and represent a property right, and as such enjoy the constitutional protection afforded to property. This is not a situation created by use of a legal interpretation in the manner implied by the Deputy.  Significant action has already been taken by Government in respect of the reduction of public service pensions, and in particular large public service pensions. The public service pension reduction (PSPR) has imposed a reduction averaging 4% on public service pensions awarded or in payment up to end-February 2012; it is currently calculated in line with the following rates and bands:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px"><table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&#8364;)</th><th><div>Reduction Rate</div></th></tr><tr><td>First 12,000</td><td><div>0%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000</td><td><div>6%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000</td><td><div>9%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000</td><td><div>12%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000</td><td><div>20%</div></td></tr></table></div></p><p>The existing reduction is estimated to save some &euro;100 million in a full year. It applies to pensions paid to some 130,000 public service pensioners paid generally from the public purse. Last year, arising from my concern about large public service pensions, I amended the legislation to increase the reduction on pension amounts over &euro;100,000 by introducing the 20% rate on this band.  Public service pensions awarded from March 2012 onwards, while not subject to the PSPR, are also subject to a significant effective reduction, reflecting the full impact of the pay cut of 1 January 2010 and, where arising, other pay cuts. The average such pension reduction is estimated at 7%, but will be considerably more severe in the case of pension awards to ministerial and other higher paid public servants who have taken proportionately larger pay cuts.</p></reply>

Last July, the Government agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff on priority areas.  As part of this approach, the Government has decided that all proposed new services across the Public Service will be tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation.  The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing with issues that would include:</p><p> - Thresholds: In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill.</p><p> - Adjudication:  This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.</p><p>  When these and a number of other issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage early in the New Year.  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector.  Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. </p></reply>

It did not have the functionality to allow many other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically.  In September 2011, the National Procurement Service issued a tender specification for a fully managed electronic tendering system to meet Ireland&rsquo;s requirements in relation to electronic public procurement and be compliant with the European Union requirements.</p><p>  The specification was to provide additional functionality including: eAssessment, eAwarding, eAuctions and Contract Management amongst others. The specification was drawn up following an in depth market analysis by a cross-agency steering group, including representatives from the HSE and Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality.  Research included presentations of systems by some of the leading service providers in the market place.  The actual specification did not seek a software development solution, but a rather an off the shelf solution to the upgraded website. The specification itself is extremely detailed and following a competitive open procedure, the contract was awarded to EU Supply, a Swedish based company.  The National Procurement Service has a five year contract with EU Supply for this upgraded system at a cost of &euro;33,874.50 per quarter. The previous service provider was recently charging &euro;57,690 per quarter, which included some data migration to the new service provider.</p></reply>

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  Therefore there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

As regards the level of programme over-commitment, the latest information is that Measure 1.1 is over-committed by &euro;18.9m.   Measure 2.1 has also been over-committed by &euro;16.9m.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the exchange rate can affect over-commitment.  Projects for these themes were approved based on the available budget at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the PEACE III Steering Committee.  Subsequent changes in exchange rate have resulted in the value of approved projects exceeding the allocation.  In addition, a degree of over-commitment is not unusual in an EU co-funded Programme of this type and size.  To ensure that an EU co-funded Programme achieves full expenditure, a certain level of over-commitment is considered prudent to balance that fact that some projects will not spend their full allocation.  The Special EU Programmes Body is the Managing Authority for the PEACE III Programme.  SEUPB is working with Government Departments North &amp; South to deal with this issue.</p></reply>

The Registrar may make an order to remedy the breach, which is binding and conclusive, and not subject to appeal (section 3(2) of the Trade Union Act 1913).</p><p> - to investigate complaints under section 16(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 concerning the operation of secret ballots, following which the Registrar may instruct a trade union to comply with the secret ballot provisions of the Act (section 14(2)). Where such instruction is disregarded the Registrar must inform the Minister, who may revoke the union&rsquo;s negotiating licence.</p><p>- to hear disputes referred to the Registrar under section 10 of the Trade Union Act, 1975 concerning the passing of resolutions approving amalgamations of trade unions.  Under this section, the Registrar may, at the request of the complainant or of the trade union, state a case for the opinion of the High Court on a question of law arising in the proceedings.</p><p>  The powers of the Registrar in relation to such matters have rarely been exercised.  The Registrar has no independent powers of investigation, and can only act where requested to do so on the specific areas mentioned above, or to refer a matter to the court in relation to wilful or fraudulent withholding of money.  This latter option is also available to &ldquo;any person&rdquo; acting on behalf of a trade union.  I have no plans to provide for the introduction of a Trade Union Ombudsman.</p></reply>

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Departments and Agencies, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region.  A key area of engagement at official level between my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland (DETI) is our joint support for enterprise projects for both sides of the border region under the INTERREG initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by DETI.  Both Departments are represented on a Steering Committee to consider project proposals.  We have provided significant financial support towards a number of North/South projects, including enterprise networking and capacity building initiatives for the border counties and Northern Ireland and several other enterprise development projects.  The assessment process for remaining projects under the current programme is on-going and officials from both administrations are also engaged in a process which will hopefully see a new INTERREG scheme initiated, when the current phase expires in 2014.</p><p>  Another key area is our on-going dialogue with our counterparts in DETI in relation to the operation of InterTradeIreland (ITI), the North/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body.  ITI is co-funded by my Department and DETI and so all matters relating to the management of the Body and the planning and oversight of its schemes and programmes, involve close interaction by the officials of both Departments.  Specifically, this engagement involves agreement on the key themes of ITI&#8217;s programmes which must be aligned with national strategies.  The engagement also includes key aspects of corporate governance and financial control, including ensuring that value for money and efficiency savings are applied to ITI programme activity.  This requires officials to engage very frequently throughout the year, to address issues that arise in relation to these requirements. A range of formal oversight arrangements are in place.  In addition, the Secretary General/Permanent Secretary of both Departments met the ITI Board recently for a general economic discussion and to overview the on-going operations of the body.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI), which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  EI North-South programmes and activities include <i>Bridging the Border</i> Seminars/partnering events.  These events are designed to promote joint opportunities between firms North and South in areas such as licensing and commercial agreements, sub-contracting, technical co-operation and business partnerships.  In addition, clients of Invest Northern Ireland (INI) can participate on EI programmes such as <i>Leadership4Growth</i> and the <i>International Selling Programme</i>.  Since 2006, clients of both agencies can access market services, trade missions, overseas offices, trade fairs, seminars, market development programmes etc., provided by each agency.  The all island <i>Innovation Voucher</i>   initiative, jointly launched by Enterprise Ireland and INI, provides Irish SMEs with access to a further 10 knowledge providers based in the North, and allows Northern Ireland  based SMEs to use INI Innovation Vouchers to access expertise in research institutions based in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>  An example of close agency cooperation is the <i>Acumen</i>   programme, a key all-island business development programme managed by InterTradeIreland and supported by Enterprise Ireland, INI, F&Aacute;S, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and the County Enterprise Boards.  The Programme is designed to stimulate cross-border sales and coordinate development amongst SMEs, North and South, to establish and build market presence in the other jurisdiction.  This is an excellent example of all relevant bodies coming together to drive enterprise development in the region.</p><p>  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now</i>   initiative, developed to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor.  The focus has been on developing compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, and make the region more attractive for investment.  More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.</p><p>  To ensure cohesive integration of the relevant activities of the two Departments, and the key Agencies in both jurisdictions, we organise an annual meeting involving my Secretary General, the Permanent Secretary of DETI, with the CEOs and Chairmen of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, to discuss a variety of North-South strategic issues.  My Department officials, and the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to increase mutual economic benefits, especially on job creation.  In addition, officials in the Employment Rights area of my Department meet on a regular basis with their counterparts in the Department of Employment and Learning to exchange views on matters of mutual interest.</p></reply>

The drawdown of exchequer monies through the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department is based on commitments made in a given year and projected draw-downs against those commitments in the year in question. It must be remembered that drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies (e.g. Competency Centres) is demand-led and can only take place if the company or body in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State at the time of the financial commitment.  In addition, there are other timing issues around finalising legal agreements with the private sector when setting up funds, for example under the Innovation Fund initiative, which means that while drawdown will take place, it may be pushed back by some months, thereby showing up as an &ldquo;underspend&rdquo; in a particular accounting period.</p><p>  Due to this demand-led nature of grant payments and issues relating to the timing of expenditure, the bulk of an allocation is often drawn down in the last quarter of the year.  The snapshot figure referred to in the Question will not be reflected in the end of year figure and the equivalent figure at the end of November showed the Department was &euro;29m behind its original profile.  To ensure that any savings at year end are utilised for job creation purposes, my Department has engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the provisions of the Multi-Annual Capital Envelope Framework whereby a portion of unspent Capital allocations in any year may be carried over to the following year.  The outcome of our negotiations will form part of this week&rsquo;s Budget.</p></reply>

There is also an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process, together with long-established dispute settling institutions that play an important role in disputes relating to collective bargaining.  The Government is committed in its Programme for Government to reform the current law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>  In a related issue, earlier this year the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organisation issued a number of recommendations arising from a complaint referred to it by ICTU and IMPACT.  The ILO, noting the commitment in the Programme for Government on collective bargaining, invited the Government, in full consultation with the social partners, to review the existing framework and consider any appropriate measures, including legislative, so as to ensure respect for the freedom of association and collective bargaining principles set out in its conclusions - including through the review of the mechanisms available - with a view to promoting machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; organisations for the determination of terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the ILO report did not find Ireland to be in breach of its obligations under ILO Conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights. Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair judgement would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition.  The established procedures can be improved and secured without creating a new statutory obligation on employers to recognise trade unions for collective bargaining purposes.  It is envisaged that adequate protective measures such as appropriate prohibition of the victimisation of trade union members and of incentivisation of persons not to be members of a trade union would be important elements of this system.  Giving effect to this commitment will require consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004.  This consultation process will be initiated in the near future.  I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile our constitutional, social and economic traditions, and our international obligations, as well as ensure continued success in attracting investment into our economy. </p></reply>

Equally, the 2005 Act also places obligations on employees in relation to their duties not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour likely to endanger their own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of bullying in the workplace, the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work 2007, published by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which operates under the auspices of my Department, is aimed at preventing and dealing with bullying where it happens in Irish workplaces.  It is a &ldquo;Code&rdquo; for both employers and employees and is available to download from the HSA&rsquo;s website at www.hsa.ie.  A significant element of the Code places an emphasis on the resolution of incidents of alleged bullying using an informal process and professional mediation services.  The Code also reflects the legal requirement that employers carry out a risk assessment, and where bullying is identified as a hazard, they ensure that it is included in the safety statement.</p><p>  The role of the HSA under the Code is to monitor if employers and employees are meeting their obligations and duty of care under the 2005 Act.  In this regard, if an employer refuses to carry out an investigation into an allegation of bullying for no reasonable reason, the HSA may ask the employer to carry out such an investigation, or, depending on the case, may request that some other form of safety, health and welfare control mechanism is put in place.  Where an employee is dissatisfied with the outcome of the internal procedures there are options available to have the dispute referred to an outside forum, such as the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) who can provide a mediation service on request where both parties are willing to engage. Such mediation is a voluntary, confidential process that allows two or more disputing parties to resolve their conflict in a mutually agreeable way with the help of a neutral third party.  The service is provided free to the parties.</p><p>  The employee also has the option to take a complaint to the Rights Commissioner Service under the Industrial Relations Acts.  Prior to the complaint being heard by a Rights Commissioner, however, it is possible that the case may be considered suitable for intervention by the recently established Early Resolution Service (ERS).  The ERS is a conciliation/mediation type service of the Workplace Relations Customer Service which is provided by Case Resolution Officers (CROs).  The ERS provides a prompt intervention which will initially involve contacting the parties, or their representatives, to secure their agreement to participate on a voluntary basis in early resolution. Using telephone and email communication the CROs will explore possible avenues of settlement in a non-prejudicial fashion.</p><p>  Where the complaint proceeds to a full hearing by a Rights Commissioner under the Industrial Relations Acts, the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation will not be legally binding and can ultimately be appealed by either party to the Labour Court.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service provides information to parties on how to bring a case before its services.  It is, therefore, open to a person (or persons) who claims that he/she is being bullied in the workplace to seek advice from the Health and Safety Authority in terms of their entitlements to work in a safe workplace, and/or to pursue a formal bullying complaint through the industrial relations services of the Department.</p></reply>

Though the original deadline for responses was 12 October, it was agreed to extend it to 9 November following a number of requests from interested parties.  The consultation attracted a sizeable number of responses, a number of which raised issues that required further consideration.  One such issue has required my Department to seek legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and the European Commission.  Subject to the satisfactory resolution of this legal issue, it is my intention to introduce Regulations to give effect to Articles 19 and 22 in the first quarter of 2013.</p></reply>

Work has already commenced on this Strategy, and initial consultations have taken place with key stakeholders.  I expect the Strategy to be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is assisting Construction companies to expand their presence in key geographic territories, to target project opportunities in emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa as well as helping them to access other international market opportunities. To achieve these objectives, EI has in place a range of direct supports to assist established client companies including those in the Construction sector. EI maintains a network of offices to ensure it reaches out to support entrepreneurs and established companies throughout the country.  A dedicated unit within Enterprise Ireland - the Potential Exporters Division &#8211; is responsible for responding to the development needs of such companies; promoting and advocating the export agenda; proactively promoting a range of tailored services, initiatives, and grants; helping companies access EI services and financial supports; proactively identifying and stimulating companies that demonstrate the potential to grow and establish a developmental agenda with those particular companies.</p><p>  In addition, the Government&#8217;s &#8364;2.25bn infrastructure stimulus package should provide significant opportunities for job creation in the Construction sector.  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Department of Education and Skills is currently carrying out a review of the apprenticeship model.  To assist redundant apprentices complete their apprenticeships, that Department, through F&Aacute;S, has put several interim measures in place, including the development of Phase 7 (equivalent) assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stone-laying, Cabinet Making and Plastering.  Redundant apprentices who wish to complete the Phase 7 equivalents should contact their Senior Training Advisor.</p><p>  F&Aacute;S has also introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM). This Mechanism provides redundant apprentices who have a time deficit in their apprenticeship, with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for the specified trade over a number of days in a F&Aacute;S Training Centre.</p><p>  Under the temporary Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme (RAPS), F&Aacute;S provides supports for apprentices to be placed with an eligible employer in order to attain the minimum duration necessary to complete their &#8220;on-the-job&#8221; training at Phases 3, 5 or 7 of the apprenticeship.  The maximum period of placement is 26 weeks for apprentices on Phases 3 and 5; and 12 weeks for those on Phase 7.  Redundant apprentices may also avail of Skills Training Courses which enhance their employment skills, as well as the range of Night Courses which are available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres.  Further information on these Programmes is available on the F&Aacute;S Website, </p></reply>

These rules are the same for all Member States of the European Union.  For the purposes of the EU regulations, Irish child benefit is classified as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. Generally speaking, the country of employment is primarily responsible for payment of family benefits. Accordingly, EU nationals, including Irish citizens, who work in Ireland, but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under the EU regulations.</p><p>   Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country under their domestic legislation, as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system.   Similarly, where the family is resident here and the person is working in another EU State that country will contact Ireland to determine any entitlements under the Irish system. Appropriate adjustments are  made to both entitlements in accordance with the EU Regulations.  </p><p>  The EU Commission attaches great importance to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union. In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, the question of reviewing the arrangements for child benefit has been raised with the EU Commissioner responsible for this area. He has indicated that he would not support such a move, as it could be seen as discriminating against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.</p></reply>

The underspend of &euro;3.872m on capital expenditure at the end of October was in relation to office accommodation and arose because the Department was not invoiced as early as it had originally anticipated for capital expenditure incurred on its behalf by the Office of Public Works.  This was because delays were encountered in securing leases or agreements with landowners in relation to new buildings and also because the roll-out of Intreo Offices in 2012 requires work on existing Social Welfare Local Offices, a significant number were still in design stage or tender stage at the end of October.</p><p>  Progress has since been made in both of these areas, with several projects completed and others advanced to the point where expenditure will be incurred early in the New Year.

The person concerned was contacted on the 3rd November 2012 requesting additional information. Once all the information requested has been received the claim will be processed and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance can be paid if all the qualifying conditions are met. One of the qualifying conditions is that the carer must be caring for the person on a full-time basis. A carer may attend an educational or training course or participate in voluntary or community-based activity for up to 15 hours a week, provided they make adequate provision for the care of the person in their absence.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. </p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. </p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  </p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. </p><p>  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. I am currently considering the findings of the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report on this issue and I intended to publish this report in due course. While the report is not yet in the public domain, it will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports. It should also be noted that the Government is not obliged to act on the findings of the Advisory Group. To date the direct cost of the Advisory Group is &euro;35,100.</p></reply>

The Pathways to Work approach involves the following:</p><p> -  More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were over 87,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in the first eight months of 2012.</p><p> - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.</p><p> - Various initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. The most prominent schemes in this regard are the Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Initiative. At October 26th 2012, there were 23,747 participants on the Back to Education Allowance scheme, with 91% previously on a jobseekers&#8217; payment. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. Some 6,000 places are available for this academic year.</p><p> - The State is also providing a wide range of vocational training options outside of the mainstream education system that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p><p> - Ensuring that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State as a pre-condition for recipe of their welfare payments. The Department will continue to implement its powers to sanction individuals who fail to engage with the &#8216;Pathways to Work&#8217; approach. The Department will also review the current rules under which sanctions can be applied and will as necessary strengthen these rules through legislation to ensure that individuals must engage with &#8216;Pathways to Work&#8217;<b>.</b></p></reply>

Over 12,300 internships have commenced to date with over 5,400 participants currently on an internship as at 22nd November 2012 and over 2,000 internship opportunities advertised on . </p><p>  An independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 52% of individuals who have completed their internships are now in paid employment.  This represents very significant progress in a short period of time. </p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP (National Employment Action Plan) will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that circa 42% of those joining the live register exit within the first three months.  Therefore, a reduction in the JobBridge eligibility period could be seen as potentially interfering with normal labour market conditions.  Furthermore, it may be seen as discouraging newly unemployed individuals from seeking jobs in the normal manner.  The recent interim evaluation report conducted by Indecon confirms that 66.9% of JobBridge participants were unemployed for over six months while 38.1% of this sub-group had been unemployed for over a year prior to commencing their JobBridge internship.  Given that the long-term unemployed have particular difficulties in securing employment, this is an important aspect of the JobBridge scheme.</p><p>  I would further advise the Deputy that the interview and selection process is entirely a matter between a Host Organisation and its potential interns.  Thus, the facility exists whereby a Host Organisation could propose a start date to coincide with their selected candidates&#8217; fulfilment of this eligibility criterion.</p><p>  It is anticipated that a final report will be published by Indecon in late December.  Part of its remit includes recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved or expanded.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

The remainder of the jobseeker's allowance recipients (9,085) are in receipt of a weekly rate that reflects either their means or family circumstances.  A detailed breakdown of the 47,855 recipients by age and rate is set out in the tabular statement below.</p><p>The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  The &euro;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:</p><p>- claimants with a qualified child;</p><p>- those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;</p><p>- those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</p><p>- those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance;</p><p>- certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</p><p>A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</p><p>Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p><p><pcenter>Tabular Statement    <b> </b></pcenter></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th><div>Weekly Rates</div></th><th><div>Weekly Rates</div></th><th><div>Weekly Rates</div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td><div>Age</div></td><td><div>&#8364;100</div></td><td><div>&#8364;144</div></td><td><div>&#8364;188</div></td><td><div>Totals</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>2,902</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>154</div></td><td><div>3,056</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>5,554</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>461</div></td><td><div>6,015</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>6,072</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>936</div></td><td><div>7,008</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>5,200</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>2,326</div></td><td><div>7,526</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>3,450</div></td><td><div>4,861</div></td><td><div>8,311</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>23</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>2,581</div></td><td><div>5,541</div></td><td><div>8,122</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>2,041</div></td><td><div>5,776</div></td><td><div>7,817</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Totals</div></td><td><div>19,728</div></td><td><div>8,072</div></td><td><div>20,055</div></td><td><div>47,855</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are currently in excess of 745,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.  The scheme provides free travel on the main public services such as Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail and Luas as well as services provided by over 90 private operators.  The previous Government froze expenditure on this scheme in 2010 and it has remained at almost &euro;76 million since then. </p><p>  My Department is currently rolling out a public services card that will be used to access all social welfare entitlements.  The card will act as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.  A variant of the public services card will be issued to free travel customers which can be scanned or read electronically on the public transport network through the integrated ticketing scheme environment or as a pass that can be shown to the bus driver.  A pilot of the public services card using the free travel variant is currently being developed in the Department for roll-out next year.  This will facilitate the collection of more complete data on the operation of the scheme.</p><p>  The cross-border free travel scheme has been in place since July 1995, initially facilitating cross-border bus or rail journeys free of charge between the two jurisdictions.  Since April 2007, the all-Ireland free travel scheme enables all seniors resident in all parts of the island to travel free of charge on bus, rail, air and ferry services participating in the travel schemes in both jurisdictions.</p><p>  There are considerable challenges ahead to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports provided by my Department which impact in some way on the lives of almost every person in the State.  As part of the deliberative process for the budget, my Department reviews all schemes.  Any changes will be announced in the upcoming Budget.</p><p>  An interdepartmental review for the free travel scheme is currently being carried out with a view to ensuring that the scheme operates in a sustainable and cost effective manner.  I appreciate that the free travel scheme has played a major role in preventing the social isolation of elderly people in Ireland, but it is important to review the operation of it to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose.  The review is in the early stages.</p></reply>

The model will seek to address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 years (inclusive) both during the school term and the school holidays.</p><p>   Extensive work has been completed by the Group to quantify the level of school-age child care that is required to support the relevant social welfare income support recipients, in particular lone parents, for each year up to and including 2015.  An examination has also been carried out of existing child care schemes and of the capital investments already made by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this sector.  Based on these findings the IDG are engaged in detailed discussions to define an effective school-age childcare model and to determine the level of funding required.  Once completed, the proposals will be submitted to Government for their consideration.  </p></reply>

The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1st July 2011.  Over 12,300 internships have commenced to date with over 5,400 participants currently on an internship as at 22nd November 2012 and over 2,000 opportunities presently advertised on .</p><p>  For the purposes of labour market policy, &#8220;a young person&#8221; is defined as those under the age of 25. Consequently, our records in relation to &#8220;young people&#8221; are reported on this basis.  I wish to advise the Deputy that those &#8220;under 25&#8221; account for 3,494 or 28% of the 12,314 placements to-date. </p><p>  The Department&#8217;s records indicate that 37% or 769 of the 2,065 individuals who have finished their JobBridge internship placement within this cohort (under 25&#8217;s) have immediately progressed into employment, 414 of whom with their Host Organisation and 355 with another organisation.  The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, The National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &#8211; 5th October 2012) stated that the extent of employment among JobBridge participants is also seen to rise as the length of time since internship completion increases. As a consequence, Indecon found that 52% of all finishers to-date were now in paid employment.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  It is expected that the progression outcomes in respect of those &#8216;under 25&#8217; would be broadly in line with the 52% figure.</p><p>  A further breakdown of progression into employment by age category will be provided in the final Evaluation Report. It is anticipated that this Report will be available in late December.  In addition to the above this evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme and present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service&#8217;s activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for:</p><p> - Transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach.</p><p> - More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were over 87,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in the first eight months of 2012.</p><p> - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.</p><p> - Incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed.</p><p> - Creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  One such measure is the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.</p><p>  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and referral to training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options. In terms of job search assistance, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.</p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again).  Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080"> </font> For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers.  The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods &#8211; and this will include targeting young people at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p>  Through the registration and referral process, young people access a wide range of programmes aimed at supporting them in their job search and increasing employability.  For example, over 12,000 young people were trained on the main F&Aacute;S programmes for unemployed people in 2011, while a further 1,700 benefitted from a specific measure for redundant apprentices.  Almost 5,000 previously unemployed young people went back to further or higher education with financial support under my Department&#8217;s Back to Education Allowance scheme.</p><p>  In addition, there are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience<b>.</b>  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme.  Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes.  The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600.  Young people also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme. </p></reply>

In June 2009, it was rolled out nationally.  Under the programme, organisations apply to offer &lsquo;work placements&rsquo; for a duration of two to nine months, within their organisations, and those who are unemployed can apply for these placements.  Certain categories of unemployed can retain their social welfare payments and entitlements while on a placement.  </p><p>  The aim of the programme is to provide unemployed people with the opportunity to work and gain experience so that they can keep their skills fresh and relevant to the job market.  For graduates, the aim is to give them the opportunity to apply their skills in a work situation and to get real work experience to add to their qualification.  There are two streams to the programme.  Graduates with a level 7 qualification can apply for both the graduate placements (WPP1) and the non-graduate placements (WPP2).</p><p>  Since the launch of WPP, in June 2009, 2,425 graduates have participated on the WPP1 Graduate stream.  Of which, 2,375 have completed their placements and the balance of 50 are currently on WPP1.  Based on responses received, our records indicate that 23% of graduates who have finished their WPP 1 placement have immediately progressed into employment on completion of their placement.  However, it is important to note that this does not take into account participants who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their placement.</p></reply>

(used by 794 employers in 2011).  In addition, the National Internship Scheme (JobBridge) supports the provision of internship places for unemployed people, with approximately 3,000 participants in 2011). </p><p>  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme allows an employer who employs an additional member of staff, who had been unemployed for six months or more, to be exempted from paying employers&#8217; PRSI for 18 months.  The job must be new and additional, be at least for 30 hours a week and last for at least six months.  The scheme was used by over 660 employers in respect of 923 employees in 2011.  From January 1st to the 26th October 2012, applications have been received from 820 employers in respect of 1,224 employees and 617 of these applications have been approved in respect of 801 employees.  Twelve per cent of employees taken on through this scheme in 2011 were under 25 years of age.</p><p>  Reduced Employer&#8217;s PRSI for Low Paid:<b></b>From 1 July 2011 the lower rate of employer PRSI was halved (to 4.25%) for all jobs that pay up to &#8364;356 per week.  Many of those employed under this scheme are likely to be younger. </p><p>  Revenue Job Assist allows employers a double wages deduction in their accounts, if they employ a person who has been unemployed for 12 months or more.  The double wages deduction may last for three years and applies to wages paid to a qualifying employee in a qualifying employment and employer&#8217;s PRSI contributions paid in respect of such wages.  Job Assist was used by 794 employers in 2011.  An employer can avail of both the Revenue Job Assist Scheme and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.</p><p>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  An Indecon evaluation found that overall some 52% of participants who had finished their internship had found employment at the time of the survey, and that 29% were employed with their host organisation.  More than one in four participants on this scheme (27%) in 2011 were under 25 years of age.</p><p>  In order to encourage employers to take up these various incentives, the Department has recently held a number of &#8216;Employer Roadshows<b>&#8217;</b> in Sligo, Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Dublin, Galway and Waterford attended by approximately 800 companies.  These roadshows advised employers of the range of services available through the Department of Social Protection&#8217;s Intreo service, which is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports.  It is the intention of the Department to increase the uptake of employer incentives in order to assist in the hiring of unemployed persons.</p></reply>

The application is with a deciding officer for a decision.  Once processed, the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.</p><p>  The average time taken to award a carer&rsquo;s allowance application is 25 weeks, however individual cases may vary.  Some will be processed quicker, others will take longer depending on complexity and whether all information is supplied by the customer at the outset.  In addition, where a customer requests a review of an initial decision to refuse an application, this will take additional time.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Following the completion of a major modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted increase in the number of new claims processed has been achieved in recent months where claims processed have substantially exceeded claim intake.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  Significant additional temporary resources already have been allocated to the backlog elimination effort and the situation continues to be monitored in order that the backlog is eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  Among the issues provided for under the Advisory Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference is for the Group to examine and report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support. Among the issues that the Group is currently considering is social insurance coverage for the self-employed.  The Group will submit its report on this issue once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  Decisions on the publication of the Group&rsquo;s reports will be made subsequently at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Legislation also provides for the transfer of bulk information relating to recipients of social welfare payments to the competent authority of another Member State or international organisation or other country with which a reciprocal agreement has been made (Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009).</p><p>  In practice, close co-operation exists between the relevant agencies in the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in October 2000 on behalf of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Work and Pensions, the Permanent Secretary, Department of Social Development and the Secretary General, Department of Social and Family Affairs (now the Department of Social Protection).  The purpose of the MOU is to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness and integrity of our mutual social security systems.</p><p>  A Management Committee was established to oversee the workings of the MOU.  The Committee comprises senior officials from Departments of Social Development, Social Protection and Work and Pensions and it assists and directs activities of the Cross Border Operational Forum, which deals with operational activities.  Through the MOU and the work of the Operational Forum, considerable benefit has been derived by the parties through sharing of best practice in counter-fraud operations and highlighting awareness of new developments.  In addition under the MOU, procedures have been implemented to ensure that all information requests and data exchanges are made through a single point of contact in each jurisdiction.</p><p>  Over the past number of years, fraud detection systems in border areas have been refined and enhanced and are subject to continuing review.  A range of measures are employed by the  Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised.  The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit works with other agencies such as Revenue, National Employment Rights Authority, Customs and the Garda&iacute; and ensures that control activity is being targeted at high risk categories of claimants/employers.  There is an active and on-going relationship between the Department&rsquo;s SIU officers and their counterparts in the Fraud Investigation Service in Northern Ireland.  The Deputies will appreciate that due to operational sensitivities, the Department is not in a position to release information regarding the specifics of control activities that target cross-border fraud.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &#8364;356 per week, the rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI is 4.25%).</p><p>  Self-employed people, including taxi drivers, can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.  If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, the person can apply to have his or her means reviewed in the light of these changed circumstances.</p><p>  My Department operates a range of supports for unemployed people and people on other social welfare payments  who wish to engage in enterprise, education and employment.  For more complete information on all the schemes available, visit my Department&#8217;s website at  or contact the Local Social Welfare Office.  My Department&#8217;s Employment Services Officers work with social welfare recipients, to identify appropriate training or development programmes, which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  These officers are located throughout the country, covering defined geographical areas and develop individual progression plans with the customer.  They work closely with F&Aacute;S, the VECs  and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and personal development opportunities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.730.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRO00300"><p>The Live Register figures from the Intreo Centre Tallaght covers the Tallaght, Dublin 24, Firhouse, Citywest, Saggart, Rathcoole, Blessington areas.  The total number of persons on the Live Register for this area in November 2012 was 11,499 including 1,890 persons who are working part-time/casually.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment. Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance. Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage. </p><p>  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration. The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.</p><p>  The outcomes delivered by the Employment Services from the Intreo Centre Tallaght are as follows:</p><p> - 3,500 customers assisted into various training opportunities</p><p> - Engagement with 117 companies through the Jobsbridge initiative</p><p> - 893 persons assisted with Technical Employment Supports Grants</p><p> - 350 persons assisted with payments from the Technical Assistance Training Fund</p><p> - 27 persons assisted through the Work Subsidy &amp; the Employment Subsidy Schemes. </p><p> - 182 persons assisted through the Work Placement Programme</p><p> - Approximately 200 persons will receive assistance through the Activation Family Support Programme by the end of 2012</p><p> - 489 persons on the Back to Education Allowance; 160 Back to Work participants and 128 Systematic Short Term Workers.</p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region. Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places. The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas. The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  Some 420 persons have been assisted towards participation on the Tus programme in the greater Tallaght area.</p><p>  Specifically to the greater Tallaght area, Community Services provide funding to:</p><p> - 25 CE schemes serving the greater Tallaght area, with a total of 578 places contained within these schemes.</p><p> - There are 5 Jobs Initiative programmes which provide 94 permanent jobs.</p><p> - There are 3 Jobs Clubs presently operating in the Tallaght area (which assist persons with interviewing skills, CV preparation, contacts with employers)</p><p> - Jobs Clubs operate for a set period of weeks for each group of persons, and have a capacity to engage with circa 400 persons per annum in the Tallaght area.</p><p> - The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p> - Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   </p><p>  Any proposals to extend such social insurance entitlements, whether through the charging of the proportion of PRSI that is usually paid by employers on behalf of employees or otherwise, will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p></reply>

The scheme allows a qualified person to retain a reducing proportion of their social protection payment plus secondary benefits over two years.  To qualify for this scheme a person must set up a self-employment business that has been approved by the Local Development Company or one of this Department&#8217;s case officers covering the area in which they live<b>. </b> The business venture must be deemed to be viable and sustainable and must not involve displacement of existing business in the same industry or service sector.  An eligible person wishing to commence a business as a taxi driver, as with any other business proposal, may apply for the allowance and have their application assessed as set out above.  Each application for BTWEA is decided on its merits within the criteria set down for the scheme.  In assessing viability, cognisance is taken of the demand for, and supply of, the particular service at local level which may vary due to a number of factors.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.

This represented 84% of the published profile. Capital spending was slightly behind profile, primarily due to certain capital projects progressing at a slightly slower rate than was anticipated. However, I expect, as with last year, that close to my Department's full provision will be utilised and no significant surpluses or deficits are envisaged. That said, the potential for a limited capital carryover into 2013 remains under consideration.</p><p>  I am very committed to ensuring that the maximum value is derived from my Department' budget in terms of maintaining, promoting and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and culture, developing cultural tourism, advancing the use of the Irish language, and supporting the sustainable development of the islands. This is reflected in the fact that in 2011, excluding Departmental administration, my Department expended approximately 99.76% of its available programme funding.  I will, of course continue to closely monitor expenditure trends across all my Department&rsquo;s subheads in the lead up to year-end to ensure the greatest possible use of the resources available.</p></reply>

As the Deputies will be aware, there are two North South Implementation Bodies under my Department's remit: Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga (comprising two agencies - Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch). The Implementation Bodies carry out a range of activities in line with their statutory remits and supported by funding from their two sponsor Departments - my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in Northern Ireland.  </p><p>  Waterways Ireland, the largest of the North South Implementation bodies, is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.  It has responsibility for approximately 1,000km of navigable waterway and, in 2007, Waterways Ireland&#8217;s remit was extended by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) to include responsibility for the restoration of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.  </p><p>  Foras na Gaeilge has a range of responsibilities regarding the Irish language, including facilitating and promoting the development of the language on an all-island basis, while the Ulster-Scots Agency has responsibility for the development of the Ulster-Scots language, including the promotion of greater awareness and use of the language and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues. </p><p>  The Implementation Bodies operate under the policy direction of the NSMC and the two Governments, and are accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the Ministers of the sponsoring Departments. Further information on these North South Implementation Bodies can be accessed on the following websites: ; ; .   </p><p>  I should say that I and officials of my Department are in regular engagement, both formally and informally, in exploring ways to enhance cooperation across various areas of our remit. In this regard, I - along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr Dinny McGinley, TD - meet with Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, on a regular basis. Our next formal engagement will be at the NSMC meetings in Inland Waterways and Language sectoral formats on 12 December next in Armagh.  </p><p>  In addition to the language and inland waterways sectors, there are a number of other areas of my Department's operations which also come within the remit of DCAL.  These include arts, culture, museums, galleries and commemorations, as well as cooperation in relation to the built and natural heritage, and environmental matters.  I am engaged directly with Minister Ni Chuil&iacute;n on programme development and planning for commemorations, especially those relating to the 1912-1922 period.  The larger commemorative events in Northern Ireland this year have been arranged at community level.</p><p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is represented on the East Border Regional Biodiversity Forum which is a cross-border initiative launched in June 2011(part-financed by the EU European Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG IVA Cross-border Programme managed by the Special EU Programmes Body). Action for Biodiversity is a 3 year project which aims to deliver a regional and cross border Biodiversity Framework for the East Border Region.  <b></b></p><p>  My Department provides funding for collaborations between museums on either side of the border, as well as projects which seek to enhance, celebrate or commemorate the artistic, cultural, musical, film or heritage of the island of Ireland.  Projects funded include:</p><p> - The Cinemagic Young Peoples Television and Film Festival, that has run successfully for many years in Belfast and since 2008 has also been held annually in Dublin;</p><p> - The Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland, established in 1995 as a means of bringing young people from different cultural backgrounds and communities together using music as a form of dialogue.  The orchestra is made up of young people aged 12 &#8211; 24 years from counties North and South, from as far apart as Cork to North Antrim.  The orchestra undertakes cross border and cross community collaborations and provides music education and performance programmes for up to 7,000 children annually.</p><p> - The Cinemobile cross-border project, a mobile cinema lorry that tours Ireland showing movies in areas that do not have a cinema.  Cinemobile carries out a project that involves the twinning of a number of schools, North and South.</p><p> - My Department has also provided funding for the provision of a Cross-Border Cultural Broker to assist in the success of Derry UK City of Culture 2013.  The Cultural Broker has responsibility for Arts and Regeneration.  </p><p>  There is ongoing cooperation between the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council/An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on for a number of years and a joint annual plenary is held where they discuss and manage common strategic commitments.  The Irish Film Board also has ongoing co-operation with Northern Ireland Screen in respect of film funding. In that regard, two new films &#8220;Jump&#8221; and &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; that are jointly funded by both bodies will be released next year.  The Culture Night initiative, which launched in Dublin in 2006, has been extended to many towns, cities and counties across the island of Ireland and the 2012 Culture Night, which took place on 21 September 2012, included participation by 6 regions in Northern Ireland.  If the Deputies are interested in receiving more specific information on any particular project or area of co-operation, I would be happy to provide it on request.</p></reply>

When the homeowner returned the forms the energy yield was in order of magnitude outside the expected performance range.  The SEAI wrote to the applicant on this basis on 23 November 2012 stating that the grant payment could not be paid as the solar heating system did not meet the minimum performance standards of the scheme and is outside the reasonable performance range of a system of its size.  </p><p>  In the letter the SEAI recommended that the applicant review their claim documentation in consultation with their contractor and if, subsequent to this, they remained dissatisfied with the decision, they should re-submit it for review by the SEAI Appeals Panel.  To date the applicant has not re-submitted the application for review to the SEAI Appeals Panel.  I am informed that if the applicant now wishes to consult with their contractor and submit revised performance details, the SEAI will review the application under their standard appeals process.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.

Gate 3 and the implementation of Grid 25 (including the North South Interconnector, Grid West and Grid Link) are essential elements in ensuring that we can deliver on our target. Any delays in building out grid reinforcements are therefore very concerning and my Department liaise on an ongoing basis with EirGrid and ESB Networks in this regard. </p><p>  REFIT 2 opened earlier this year and is for projects connected by end 2015. The Department had initially approached the European Commission with a request to keep the scheme open until 2020, however the Commission considered this to be too long from a state aid perspective.  This obviously poses challenges as many of the projects required to meet our 2020 target will not be built by end 2015. A new scheme will be required for the post 2015 period.</p><p>  With the move to develop a target European electricity market as part of the EU third package, the SEM Committee have a consultation open on how the electricity market on this island will become compliant with the target model.  Following this decision being made, consideration will begin in 2013 as to what format a post 2015 renewable support mechanism will take.  The European Commission is also due to publish voluntary guidelines on design of renewable energy support schemes in 2013, which the new scheme will take account of. In line with evolving thinking, the new scheme is likely to involve greater market exposure for renewable developers. We would intend to have the new scheme in place by 2014, well before the REFIT 2 scheme ends.</p></reply>

As it is a national plan, it does not go into any specifics at county level.  Each county is required to develop a County Development Plan and must have regard to wind energy guidelines.

The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the more recent Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) are examples of such interventions.</p><p>  Prior to the launch of the NBS my Department had a full national mapping exercise carried out to determine precisely where the gaps in service provision existed.  As a result Camp was one of the areas in the country that was excluded from the scheme as it was deemed to be already served by at least one private operator.  Under the RBS my Department received a total of 67 applications from County Kerry and a total of 25 applicants took up an offer of service from one of the commercial operators participating in the scheme.</p><p>  The recently published National Broadband Plan (NBP) commits industry and the Government to rolling out high speed broadband throughout the country in the next few years.  The plan contains specific and ambitious targets, most of which are expected to be delivered by the private sector.  The Government is committed to ensuring that high speed broadband will also be available in rural areas which might not be deemed commercially viable for private sector operators to invest in.  My Department hopes to commence a national mapping exercise in early 2013 aimed at identifying precisely the areas of the country that the private sector will invest in and those rural parts that will require State intervention to ensure that our NBP and Digital Agenda for Europe targets are fully met.</p></reply>

The <i>Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012,</i> published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2012, detail gross expenditure of &#8364;467 million on the current side of the Vote and gross capital expenditure (including carryover) of &#8364;895 million in respect of my Department in 2012.  Current spending in 2012 is running close to the profile established at the start of the year. Capital spending is behind profile; this is due primarily to fewer new water services contracts than had been expected commencing in 2012 and to slower than anticipated drawdown of housing expenditure by local authorities.  I expect significant further expenditure to take place by end 2012.  Consideration will be given, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the appropriate use of any potential savings arising on the Vote.</p></reply>

In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority to, by order, declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road.  Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received.  The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act.  However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority <i>may</i> take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, <i>at any time</i> after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

In this regard, payroll savings have been delivered mainly through staff reductions of almost 8,600 (23%) from 37,243 (June 2008) to 28,652 (September 2012).  The departure of 8,600 staff from the sector since 2008 has inevitably impacted in different ways upon individual local authorities.  My Department and local authorities have prioritised the examination of the present and future workforce demographic in the context of service delivery, organisational diversity, knowledge transfer, up-skilling/re-skilling and succession planning.</p><p>  To support the sector in effectively managing the combination of staff reductions and the reform/change programme a Workforce Study has been undertaken jointly by local authorities and my Department.  In particular, the study assesses the management requirements of local authorities bearing in mind the potential impacts of shared services and other reform initiatives underway.  Each local authority is in turn preparing a detailed workforce plan outlining how it will implement the study&rsquo;s recommendations.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge.  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.</p><p>The target is to maximise the yield from the Household Charge in all areas.  The attached table details the total number of payments and waivers registered for the Household Charge nationally and by local authority area , as of 29 November 2012.  The figures are also presented as a percentage of the estimated total number of liable properties nationally and per local authority area.</p><p>Overall, compliance continues to grow.  The compliance rate from local authority to local authority varies considerably, however, from 85% in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown to 55% in Donegal.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to use the provisions of the legislation, combined with their local knowledge and judgement, to increase compliance.  I expect that local authorities will use the available avenues to the fullest to help fund the services which are important for the wellbeing of every household and community.  The legislation empowers local authorities to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and local authorities will pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings where it is considered appropriate.  I urge all liable persons who have not paid the Charge to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.  Property owners who are unsure of their liability should also contact their local authority.</p><p><table><tr><th>County/City Council </th><th><div>Estimated number of liable properties </div></th><th><div>Total registered (paid + waivers) </div></th><th><div>Registrations as a % of total estimated liable properties </div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td><div>18,257 </div></td><td><div>12,097 </div></td><td><div>66% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td><div>25,611 </div></td><td><div>17,204 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td><div>45,786 </div></td><td><div>33,046 </div></td><td><div>72% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td><div>41,649 </div></td><td><div>28,125 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td><div>143,887 </div></td><td><div>93,123 </div></td><td><div>65% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td><div>65,331 </div></td><td><div>36,139 </div></td><td><div>55% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td><div>190,685 </div></td><td><div>138,359 </div></td><td><div>73% </div></td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown </td><td><div>74,390 </div></td><td><div>63,396 </div></td><td><div>85% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td><div>90,286 </div></td><td><div>62,044 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td><div>27,086 </div></td><td><div>20,184 </div></td><td><div>75% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td><div>62,851 </div></td><td><div>41,765 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td><div>58,792 </div></td><td><div>43,475 </div></td><td><div>74% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td><div>68,215 </div></td><td><div>45,856 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td><div>32,067 </div></td><td><div>21,417 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td><div>26,185 </div></td><td><div>16,475 </div></td><td><div>63% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td><div>13,069 </div></td><td><div>9,176 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td><div>20,380 </div></td><td><div>14,131 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td><div>46,473 </div></td><td><div>31,741 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td><div>12,928 </div></td><td><div>8,761 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td><div>41,176 </div></td><td><div>25,255 </div></td><td><div>61% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>51,363 </div></td><td><div>38,741 </div></td><td><div>75% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td><div>60,652 </div></td><td><div>38,278 </div></td><td><div>63% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td><div>20,176 </div></td><td><div>13,871 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>North Tipperary </td><td><div>24,839 </div></td><td><div>18,077 </div></td><td><div>73% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td><div>25,224 </div></td><td><div>15,175 </div></td><td><div>60% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td><div>23,888 </div></td><td><div>16,124 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td><div>25,281 </div></td><td><div>17,821 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td><div>81,822 </div></td><td><div>52,378 </div></td><td><div>64% </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Tipperary </td><td><div>30,368 </div></td><td><div>20,737 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City </td><td><div>15,753 </div></td><td><div>10,661 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td><div>24,777 </div></td><td><div>16,474 </div></td><td><div>67% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td><div>29,872 </div></td><td><div>20,448 </div></td><td><div>69% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td><div>56,030 </div></td><td><div>36,695 </div></td><td><div>66% </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td><div>45,665 </div></td><td><div>32,035 </div></td><td><div>70% </div></td></tr><tr><td>National </td><td><div>1,620,814 </div></td><td><div>1,109,284 </div></td><td><div>68% </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

That legislation also provides for the payment of state funding to political parties being conditional on parties having at least 30% women and 30% men candidates at the next general election.</p><p>  The debate on the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Bill 2012, which was published on 5 October 2012, commenced in the D&aacute;il on 20 November.  The Government legislation programme includes an Electoral (Amendment) (Referendum Spending and scellaneous Provisions) Bill to be published in 2013 which will implement more commitments in the Programme for Government.  Arising from the Action Programme for Effective Local Government I have established a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee to review and make recommendations on local electoral area boundaries in time for the 2014 local elections and my Department is providing administrative support to that committee.</p><p>  Following these tasks, I will be addressing the Programme for Government commitment to establish an Electoral Commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department.  Establishment of an Electoral Commission will be a major body of work.  Issues for consideration include international best practice, the Commission's structure and functions, who it reports to, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration, and the approach to be followed in relation to the extensive legislation that will be required, as well as practical matters including staffing and funding arrangements.</p></reply>

BRL&#8217;s principal objects are, <i>inter alia</i>, to prepare plans for the redevelopment and regeneration of Ballymun and to act as developer/contractor for the regeneration project.  In accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association, all contracts procured and entered into by BRL, including services and works contracts, are in the name of the company. </p><p>  BRL is a company limited by guarantee, and not having a share capital, and is registered with the Companies Registration Office.  The company is wholly owned by Dublin City Council; the shareholders of the company consist of seven senior officials of Dublin City Council.  The company is overseen by a Board of Directors drawn from the local community, local business interests, representatives of statutory bodies involved in regeneration and elected members and officials of Dublin City Council. </p><p>  BRL has its own Chief Executive Officer and management structure and is staffed in a number of different ways including through secondment of staff from Dublin City Council and secondments from other local authorities.  These secondees remain permanent and pensionable employees of their respective local authorities.  The company also recruited a number of fixed-term contract staff directly through open competition.  It is a matter for BRL to determine the numbers, duration and terms of individual contracts having regard to work demands and the particular skill-sets required to plan and deliver individual projects. </p><p>  The Ballymun regeneration project is now moving into the completion phase and all demolition and construction projects are expected to be substantially completed by 2014.  In light of this, it is expected that staff numbers will decline in line with the decrease in the overall level of planning and construction activity in Ballymun. </p><p>  In terms of the consultation and communications process, the emphasis has changed from the initial strategic level consultation with stakeholders, local community groups and residents associations in relation to the development and implementation of the regeneration masterplan to the local level of one-to-one engagement with residents in relation to relocation.  Consultation and communication on matters relating to regeneration policy and practice is also facilitated by having local community and public representatives on the Board of BRL. </p><p>  BRL&#8217;s offices are located at the Civic Centre on Main Street and are open to the public from Monday to Friday between the hours of 9.00 and 17.00.  BRL have a dedicated Communications Team available at their offices to deal with telephone and email queries and also to deal with queries and complaints from members of the public in relation to any matter within its remit.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law. </p><p>  My Department issues guidance to Returning Officers in advance of each election and referendum.  The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed. </p><p>  In addition, at my request, my Department wrote to each Returning Officer on 4 October 2012, advising that, wherever practicable, the opportunity should be taken to employ unemployed persons at polling stations and in carrying out the subsequent counting of votes at elections and referendums so as to provide opportunity for work experience to unemployed persons.  I believe that this should apply particularly in relation to the Polling Clerk position, where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer. </p><p>  My Department wrote to Returning Officers on 19 November 2012 asking that they outline the extent to which unemployed persons were engaged in the conduct of the poll and the counting of the votes at the referendum held on 10 November 2012.  They were also invited to comment on the issues that can arise in providing temporary employment to the unemployed at elections and referendums, based on their experiences.

Following a request for additional funding to be made available this year, my Department advised Fingal County Council on 26 October that, as a result of an under-spend by some local authorities of their grant allocations for 2012, a sum of &euro;200,000 could be made available for spending on the grant schemes in the current year.  I understand however that the council are not in a position to draw down the extra funding this year.

There will be a proportionate and risk-based approach to inspections, which will be targeted towards areas where drinking water sources or habitats are at risk from septic tank discharges.  My Department is currently examining the possibility of introducing a grants scheme as part of the inspection system. However, any grants scheme introduced will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and the financial position of the individual households concerned.</p></reply>

This policy sets out a range of measures which will significantly revise the current regulatory regime to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that waste collected is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy; that mandated service levels are delivered; and that Customer Charters are put in place by all waste collection providers.  Customer Charters will be required to clearly set out information for customers in relation to issues such as charging structures, procedures for dealing with customers who may fall into arrears, and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another. I have written to the waste management industry in relation to the development of such Customer Charters ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime.</p><p>  The work of developing new regulatory structures to give effect to these measures has commenced and my Department is engaging with a range of key stakeholders in relation to the detailed design of the new system.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears. Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.</p><p>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme specifically, the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway. I will shortly publish material on my Department&rsquo;s website, in furtherance of the review, and this will facilitate stakeholder consultation which is likely to take place early next year.</p></reply>

Where a planning authority proposes to carry out development in accordance with Part 8 the Manager of the planning authority must consult the public and prescribed authorities. In doing so, the planning authority must:</p><p> - erect a site notice and publish a newspaper notice indicating the location, nature and extent of the development;</p><p> - state in these notices that plans and particulars of the proposed development are available for inspection at the offices of the local authority for a specified period;-send notice of the proposed development to a list of prescribed bodies;</p><p> - and invite the making of submissions or observations on the proposed development.</p><p>  In addition, proposals for developments to be carried out by local authorities are subject to review by the elected members. The members can decide, by resolution, to vary or modify the proposed development, other than as recommended by the Manager, or can decide not to proceed with the development. Local authorities are then required to give notice of their decision to any persons or bodies who made submissions or observations.  These public consultation procedures also apply to proposed development under section 179(1)(<i>d</i>) of the 2000 Act where development is proposed to be carried out on behalf of, or in partnership with, the local authority in its own functional area, pursuant to a contract with the local authority, for example by way of public private partnership.</p><p>  Under section 175 of the Act, where development is proposed to be carried out on behalf of, or in partnership with a local authority in its own functional area and in respect of which the preparation of an environmental impact statement is required, or under section 177(AE), where a Natura impact statement is required for a similar development proposal, the same public consultation procedures must be carried out.</p></reply>

The Local Authorities and the Housing Agency are working systematically with NAMA to determine if there is a social housing demand for properties identified as potentially suitable for social housing, including the need for accommodation for those who are homeless. Where a demand is identified this information is provided to NAMA and efforts are made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing. </p><p>  To the end of August 2012, 133 housing units have been provided from the portfolio of units identified by NAMA. Of these units 49 are funded under leasing arrangements with the balance of units delivered purchased with funds from the local authority social housing capital investment programme or by Approved Housing Bodies under the Capital Assistance Scheme.  It is a matter for each individual housing authority to allocate available accommodation, whether leased properties or from other sources, to households on their waiting lists, including homeless households, in accordance with their adopted allocation scheme.  The charging and collection of development levies is a matter for the local planning authority. The discharge of the development contribution liability in respect of any development is a matter for agreement between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however, lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.</p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub - prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.   </p><p>  Two pilot schemes for mortgage to rent in respect of distressed local authority borrowers are underway in Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council. These are being introduced as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process which is being implemented by all local authorities. Mortgage to rent for local authority borrowers will be extended to all local authority areas next year.</p></reply>

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>  The collection of the Household Charge is under the care and management of local authorities.

Measures already in place to encourage the development of alternatives to landfill include a landfill levy of &#8364;65 per tonne and regulations which require the diversion from landfill of food waste arising on specified premises.  </p><p>  The EPA is the national repository for waste management statistics and the most recent available information in respect of waste management can be found in the 2010 National Waste Report available on the EPA&#8217;s website at  .

The Directive sets legally binding limit values, and target values for a range of pollutants and requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring is conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.   </p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of permanent and fixed-term air quality monitoring stations located around the country, reporting the results on its website at: <font color="#0000FF">. </font> Monitoring includes the following pollutants: nitrogen oxides; sulphur dioxide; carbon monoxide; ozone; particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone, benzene and volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  The EPA publishes also an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2011 &#8211; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>  , was published in September 2012 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2011, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. </p><p>  No exceedances of EU limit values were recorded for 2011 and downward trends have been identified for many pollutants. However, levels of particulate matter (PMs) are a concern, especially where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on bituminous coal does not apply. To maintain good standards of air quality and ensure that, in the future, air across all Ireland will be healthy and clean, local authorities must continue to enforce the ban on bituminous coal with improved effectiveness. Air quality could also benefit significantly if households used more efficient methods for space heating by shifting from solid fuel to cleaner, more efficient alternatives; this would also have additional climate benefits by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.   </p><p>  Following public, industry and local authority consultations, I introduced revised and updated solid fuel regulations to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential solid fuels. Under the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 which were given effect in August 2012,</p><p> - most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;</p><p> - seven new towns are being added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and</p><p> - a prohibition on the burning of bituminous or smoky coal was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution. </p><p>  The new regulations will ensure that the ban continues to be effective in maintaining good air quality standards in our cities and towns, protecting human health and the environment.  Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels in larger urban areas, derived mainly from road traffic, have remained relatively static since 2002, with signs of a slight increasing trend in the years 2008-2010. Further reductions of NO<sub>2</sub> levels will require improved emission standards from new vehicles, reduced demand for private road transport, increased use of alternatives to the private car such as cycling, walking and public transport.   </p></reply>

This is especially so in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s role as incoming EU Presidency, during which we will be responsible for leading the EU&rsquo;s follow-up work to the Doha Conference of the Parties over the course of the first half of 2013. As incoming Presidency, we are already involved in a large number of additional engagements in Doha, working with the current Presidency (Cyprus), the Council Secretariat and the European Commission, as they conduct bilateral engagements with key delegations from other Parties and regional groupings. </p><p>  Insofar as my Department&rsquo;s element of the Irish delegation is concerned, in addition to my own participation in the High-Level Segment, a total of nine officials from my Department are attending part or all of the two-weeks involved, with four officials attending the full conference (and EU preparatory meetings). During the High Level Segment, I also intend to take the opportunity to hold pre-Presidency Ministerial bi-laterals with Ministers from other EU Member States.   </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s full delegation will be staying at the Kempinski Hotel. This was chosen on the basis that the current EU Presidency, the European Commission and the Council Secretariat are all staying there and, as incoming Presidency, it is useful to co-locate with others forming part of the overall EU delegation to facilitate close co-operation and, where necessary, allow for easy arrangement of early morning/late night meetings at short notice. In all cases, the bookings are for the lowest of three available categories of accommodation in the hotel. The total cost of accommodation for my Department&rsquo;s attendance at the conference (a total of 108 person nights of accommodation) is approximately &euro;16,000 (subject to exchange rate variations) or an average of approximately &euro;149 per person per night. All flights to/from Doha for the Department&rsquo;s delegation are in economy class, with an aggregate cost to the Department of just over &euro;5,000, or an average of approximately &euro;500 per person.</p></reply>

Guidance issued by my Department in relation to the involvement of Councillors on SPCs states that every County/City Councillor should, as a matter of equity and good practice, have the opportunity to serve on an SPC and that SPC Councillor membership should reflect the proportionality and the distribution of elected representation on the full Council. This guidance goes on to state that the allocation of SPC chairs should also reflect equitably the spread of   elected representation on the Council. The purpose of these guidelines, which acknowledge the difficulty in legislating fully for such good will and practice , is to ensure that the various political and other interests represented on the full   Council are treated fairly, and equitably represented in the SPC system.     </p><p>  In implementing the <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government &#8211; Putting People First</i>, chairs of SPCs and the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) will continue to be filled pro-rata, based on the size of the relevant groups within the Council. Membership of the CPG will be extended to include leaders of party or other groupings (where these are not already members by virtue of being chairs of SPCs) to ensure that the strategic guidance of SPCs reflects the political balance of the Council.  In view of the current arrangements and their continuance in implementing <i>Putting People First</i>, I do not propose to prescribe any methodology, including the D'Hondt method, which could have a negative impact in ensuring an equitable spread of elected representation on local authority committees and their chairs as between representatives of political parties and independent councillors . It is, however, open to any local authority to use the methodology where this would be compatible with the guidance detailed above.</p></reply>

The shared objective of the project was to provide an established co-operative process for sharing information and addressing any technical issues arising. This represented a significant advance in addressing Ireland&#8217;s long-standing concerns about Sellafield. </p><p>  The Government engaged a team of independent technical experts that included nuclear physicists, chemists and engineers. The expert team brought specialist knowledge and expertise which is not readily available within the Irish Government system due to the absence of a nuclear power generation or reprocessing industry here. The function of the team was to conduct a comprehensive, objective and scientific assessment of the technical information on Sellafield and its associated facilities made available from the intergovernmental exchange project. The key output is a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) report of the risks to Ireland and Irish interests from incidents at the Sellafield nuclear site.</p><p>  The team paid a number of site visits to Sellafield, examined various facilities, accessed extensive documentation, and conducted a number of technical exchanges with operators at the site and with UK regulators which enabled the team to develop reliable, accurate, risk models and calculations. The expert team used additional sources of information such as their own knowledge of operating history and data from similar nuclear facilities around the world to make expert judgments.   </p><p>  On completion of the project, the team produced a 1,000 page main report. A public summary document was released as the team recommended that the full report should not be published because to have such a substantial volume of security-sensitive information in the public domain would serve to increase the risks posed by Sellafield to both the UK and to Ireland. This 4 year project cost &#8364;4.8m gross, or &#8364;4.0m net of VAT. As the team&#8217;s brief was explicitly to assess the risks posed to <i>Ireland</i> from Sellafield, the UK did not meet any of these costs, though the UK would have incurred its own costs through, for example, facilitating the information exchange and hosting site visits.   </p><p>  My Department and others will now study the information in the report in detail and use it in the context of Government policies relating to Sellafield and the nuclear sector more broadly. Ireland must continue to be vigilant in relation to Sellafield as work to decommission the site over the lifetime of the &#8220;Sellafield Plan&#8221; continues. It is critical from an Irish perspective that the UK decommissioning of the site is undertaken safely and in accordance with best international practice.  The finalisation of this report marks the improved information sharing process that has developed between the Irish and UK Governments since 2008. Particularly given our status as a non-nuclear country, Ireland looks forward to continued timely sharing of key information with the UK authorities in the future on nuclear matters, including Sellafield and the UK nuclear new-build programme.</p></reply>

Both documents were published on 9 June 2011 and are available on my Department&#8217;s website -   The Committee has met on ten occasions since it was established in June 2011 and has harnessed the input of members representing the banking, construction, and local authority sectors as well as NAMA and residents.   </p><p>  To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some &#8364;3.5 million to local authorities to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.   It is open to local authorities to make application for funding under the scheme where the estate in question qualifies for funding.</p><p>  Planning authorities are making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work. Developers and owners of unfinished housing developments (or their receivers, where appointed) have the primary legal obligation in addressing outstanding problems associated with these developments.   </p><p>  As part of the work of the National Co-Ordination Committee, a legislative review group was set up to assess the adequacy of existing legislation in tackling the issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Its remit was to review legislation such as the Derelict Sites Act 1990; the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010 and the Water Services Act, 2007 with a view to strengthening or amending provisions to take account of the issues associated with unfinished developments.  It concluded that the existing legislation was adequate and no amending legislation was necessary.  Road safety issues come within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.1002.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRS05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 453 together.</p><p>  In the Dublin Metropolitan Region, the registration of non-nationals is undertaken by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) at the Registration Office situated at 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2. There are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. As it happens, September and October are the peak months for registrations in the State primarily as a result of students beginning or returning to their studies. In recognition of this, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges. Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students.</p><p>  This year these arrangements were extended into November. Naturally, at particularly busy periods and not withstanding the special arrangements put in place, there may be occasions when, based on the numbers seeking to register and estimated processing times, processing capacity is reached for that day and persons attending beyond that point are asked to return at another time. This is simply a matter of managing demand on the day in a  sensible, proactive and safe manner.</p><p>  The increase in the fee in respect of the issue of a registration certificate under the Immigration Act, 2004 came into effect on 19 November, 2012. Any person issued with a registration certificate from that date will be required to pay the new fee of &#8364;300 unless they come within those categories exempted from the charge. In respect of persons who may have been seeking to obtain a re-entry visa, I should point out that the fees for same have not changed.</p><p>  It should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: </p><p>  - UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>  - Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>  - Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>  - Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>  - Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>  - Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996; and</p><p>  - Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &#8364;3.2 million in fees waived.</p><p>  It is an unavoidable consequence that people seeking to register will fall on the either side of the fee increase introduction. It is understandable too that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) rising to exceptional levels at certain times. </p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should also add that the cost of various services to immigrants here compares favourably with other jurisdictions and that, in particular in respect of student immigrants, the fee charged for immigration services is, in the great majority of cases, a small proportion of the overall fees they are required to pay the supplier of educational services. I would point out that this is the first increase since 2008 and that the fee increase itself will be used to defray some of the costs of providing and developing enhanced services to migrants.</p><p><i>The following information was provided under Standing Order 40A.</i></p><p><i></i>The main issue that gave rise to the difficulty on the day in question was physical capacity in the office which deals with immigration registration which is performed by civilian employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  At an early stage of the day in question, it became clear that physical capacity to the office to deal with applications had been reached and indeed exceeded.  Because of this a number of applicants were turned away and advised to return on the following week - at which time of course the fee increase had come into effect.  It is not possible to say with complete accuracy how many people were in this category but the Garda&iacute; estimate that it may have been in the region of 60 people.  I am also advised that this number is likely to include people who had other immigration related business on that day which was unrelated to registration.</p><p>  Having reflected on the matter, in addition to turning these applicants away and requesting them to return on another occasion, it would also have been appropriate to take their details so that upon their return a lower fee could have been charged to them.  In saying this, I think it is important to acknowledge that everyone acted in good faith and made their best endeavours to deal with a huge increase in the volume of callers to the office where this business is conducted.</p><p>  While clearly there will always be difficulties in circumstances where fees are being increased where some will inevitably fall outside the cut off point, nevertheless it should be possible to put in place some arrangement to deal with the type of situation which occurred in this instance. </p><p>  Accordingly, I have requested my officials in conjunctions with the Garda National Immigration Bureau to devise a system which would to the greatest extent possible avoid a recurrence of such a problem.</p><p>  In the meantime, I would like to apologise to the individuals in question for any inconvenience caused to them.  It is not possible to independently identify such persons so therefore they cannot be refunded the additional fee charge.</p></reply>

That would include the death referred to by the Deputy. However, as he will appreciate, that is currently the subject of an inquiry by the coroner in that jurisdiction. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter.  The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.1014.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRT00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 and 445 together.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, legal aid services within this State are divided into two separate categories, namely civil legal aid through the Legal Aid Board under the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid 1995, and criminal legal aid through the courts and the judiciary under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962.  I propose to take each in turn as set out below:</p><p><b>  Civil Legal Aid</b></p><p>  In the first instance it should be noted that in the vast majority of cases, civil legal aid is not free. Persons who receive civil legal services are generally obliged to pay a financial contribution.</p><p>  The criteria for qualifying for civil legal aid are set out in sections 24 to 29 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 &#8211; 2006. In summary, the financial eligibility threshold at the moment is that a person&#8217;s disposable income must not exceed &#8364;18,000. Disposable income is calculated by taking a person&#8217;s gross income (the Board does not treat certain State payments that are made for the benefit of another person as income) and deducting certain allowances. The main allowances are an allowance for a spouse, each child, child care costs, rent or mortgage, income tax, PRSI and USC payments. There is also a capital threshold for eligibility.   disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, small claims and defamation.  There is a general &#8216;merits&#8217; test for getting legal advice and a more specific test for getting legal aid (representation). Legal aid can only be granted for matters before the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice. In addition the Minister for Justice and Equality may prescribe any other court or a tribunal for the purpose of making legal aid available. The only tribunal that has been prescribed to date is the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  At present, I have no plans to change the qualification criteria for civil legal aid.</p><p><b>  Criminal Legal Aid</b></p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.</p><p>  Under the Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  This is purely a discretionary matter for each court and is not governed by any financial eligibility guidelines.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.</p><p>  An applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  Such an offence carries a penalty of a fine or imprisonment or both.</p><p>  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Also, it must be borne in mind that Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  It is with due regard to these clear rights that any criminal legal aid scheme must operate.</p><p>  Officials of my Department are developing a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid, including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  As currently drafted, the Bill will regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse. The transfer of responsibility arrangement to the Legal Aid Board reflects the practice in other jurisdictions where one agency deals with all aspects of legal aid and where it is thereby possible to bring a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of all of the legal aid schemes.  There is still a significant amount of work to be done in developing the Bill but I would hope that it would be possible to publish it during 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be interested to know that the fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme have been subject to three separate reductions over the past few years and some structural changes were also introduced to the fees payable in the course of 2011.  To date in 2012, expenditure is &#8364;46.16 million which represents a welcome decrease of approximately 10% over the same period in 2011.  A number of measures aimed at achieving greater efficiencies in criminal proceedings are being implemented in collaboration with the relevant agencies and with cooperation from legal practitioners.</p></reply>

Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, an executive office within my Department, actively contributed to all stages of the drafting process in relation to the Convention.  That process took place over a period of almost two years.</p><p>  The detailed provisions of the Convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would be necessary to allow signature and ratification of the Convention by Ireland are being examined in conjunction with the government commitment to consolidate and reform domestic violence legislation. However, I have been advised that Article 52 on emergency barring orders presents a particular difficulty in relation to property rights under the Irish constitution.  I propose to consult again with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in relation to the legal difficulty relating to Article 52 and other issues. The matter will then be submitted for decision of the Government on the issue of signature of the Convention.  I am informed that 25 Council of Europe member states have signed the Convention and one has ratified it. It has not yet entered into force as this requires at least ten member states to ratify it.</p></reply>

Given the large number and wide range of client groups, the registration process is managed through umbrella organisations which provide single points of contact.  This ensures more effective co-ordination of the application and response process, and improved quality control in the various sectors.  It also ensures a more efficient use of resources in the vetting process which is a critical factor given that there are over 20,000 organisations registered at present with the GCVU for this purpose and that the GCVU is handling an average of approximately 30,000 applications per month.</p><p>  It is not feasible to extend the registration process to individuals as this would have the potential to overwhelm the vetting process with consequent unacceptable delays.  In the circumstances it is suggested that an individual could consult within their own profession with a view to identifying an appropriate umbrella organisation to handle an application.</p></reply>

No. 380 of 2012), which came into effect on 1 December 2012, revokes the Land Registration (Fees) Order 1999 and introduces new fees for Land Registry services. The Land Registration (Fees) Order 2012 also introduces new bands for the relevant fees relating to the consideration (value) of transfers on sale and includes details of fees for new services which are now offered by the Property Registration Authority.</p><p>  Section 21 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 provides that I as Minister for Justice and Equality, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp; Reform, may by Order fix the fees to be charged by the Property Registration Authority for its services. The legislation provides that the fees shall not be fixed at a level calculated to produce an annual amount which is less than that sufficient to discharge the salaries, remuneration and other expenses payable under the Act, i.e. fees are to be set at a level sufficient to meet the full cost associated with Property Registration Authority services. It should be noted that the land registry fees have not been adjusted since 2000, which is a key reason for the need for a significant increase in the level of charges to ensure that the fees cover the cost of PRA services.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences. In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to Garda&iacute; to tackle the misuse of alcohol, including the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  Garda&iacute; may can also seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Fixed charge notices may be issued for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. This option has the benefit of a more efficient use of Garda and Court resources, while also allowing an offender who complies with the notice to avoid a possible criminal record.</p><p>  Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011 provides Garda&iacute; with the power of arrest without warrant where a person begging, harasses, intimidates, assaults or threatens any other person or persons, or obstructs the passage of persons or vehicles, and fails to comply with a direction to move on peaceably from the vicinity.</p><p>  Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act relates to anti-social behaviour by children.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</p><p>  Where anti-social behaviour is directed at property, the Garda&iacute; have recourse to the provisions of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 which provides a range of offences and penalties, up to and including, on conviction on indictment, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years for the damage, threat of damage or possession of anything with intent to damage, a person&rsquo;s property.</p><p>  The foregoing are some of the more important pieces of legislation in relation to anti-social behaviour. There are many others which may be relevant depending on the nature and gravity of the behaviour at issue. </p></reply>

The majority of the Act's sections have not yet been commenced as they are contingent on the establishment of a new Charities Regulatory Authority, which has been postponed due to budgetary constraints. Notwithstanding this, it remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of this sector in effective and proportionate ways. To advance this, I intend to conduct a public consultation to invite views from charities, other interested stakeholders, and members of the public on issues connected with the implementation of the Charities Act.  These will include the establishment of a Charities Regulatory Authority; the statutory registration of charities and granting of charitable status; and the types of information that a Charities Regulatory Authority might require from registered charities each year. A document to form the basis for the consultation is currently in preparation in my Department and I hope to publish this on the Department's website early in the New Year.  The consultation period will run for eight weeks from the date of its publication. I look forward to a wide-ranging and informed consultation process on these important issues.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for the modernisation and reform of the way legal services are provided in the State along with the more independent regulation of the legal professions and greater transparency and competition in relation to legal costs. The Bill, therefore, gives legislative expression to the commitment given in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.</i>It supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery as a specific deliverable under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding while also taking account of recommendations made by the Legal Costs Working Group and by the Competition Authority. The Competition Authority has published reports on several of the professions in addition to solicitors and barristers - for example, on doctors and dentists - and these other professions are outside my remit as Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Defence.</p><p>  In relation to Deputy Broughan's question on legal costs, the Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. For the first time, these cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.</p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs. Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures.</p><p>  While the accountability of the two legal professions is to be enhanced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill, it is not accurate to contend that there are no &quot;independent procedures and penalties operated by the Law Society of Ireland&quot;. Under current law the Law Society is, in fact, bound by the conduct regime of the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011. In particular, Part 3 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act of 1994 makes detailed provision for the investigation of complaints against solicitors. The Society&#8217;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints lodged directly to the Law Society by members of the public. A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles such a complaint may, under the current legislation, then refer the matter to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (also appointed under the Solicitors Acts)   at any time within the three year period immediately following the Society&#8217;s decision.</p><p>  Complaints about professional misconduct may also be made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  Even where a complaint of misconduct has been made to the Law Society in the first instance, it may also be referred by the Society to the Tribunal.  The members of the Tribunal, which includes lay persons, are appointed by the President of the High Court. Where there is a finding of misconduct, the Tribunal can impose a sanction on the solicitor ranging from admonishment to a direction to pay restitution of a sum not exceeding &#8364;15,000 to any aggrieved party. In more serious cases the Tribunal may refer its finding and recommendation to the President of the High Court who ultimately will decide on the nature of the sanction to be imposed on the solicitor. The powers of sanction available to the High Court range up to the striking off of a solicitor. If either party is unhappy with a decision of the Tribunal this may be appealed to the High Court. The Law Society's disciplinary regime, the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal and the High Court have dealt with several high-profile cases in recent years some of which, as Deputy Daly will be aware, have resulted in the striking off of the solicitor concerned.</p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill represents both an enhancement and a broadening of the existing disciplinary regime by providing for an independent body, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, to consider complaints against solicitors and barristers with the support of a designated Complaints Committee. The Regulatory Authority will be independently appointed and have a lay majority and a lay chair. It will provide a first point-of-call for complaints that is fully independent of the professional bodies. Under the Bill, therefore, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or the Bar Council, or to their respective disciplinary tribunals, to deal with complaints as generally happens at present. Instead, they will do so through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. The new Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal will replace the two separate conduct tribunals operating at present with one entity dealing with allegations of misconduct relating both to solicitors and to barristers. </p></reply>

Approximate figures available for the number of applications submitted by a naturalised parent on behalf of their minor child for the years 2005 to 2012 are: 400, 400, 400, 700, 1,300, 1,500, 2,400 and 3,900 respectively.</p><p>  When I came into office in March, 2011, I was determined to tackle the backlog that had built up in the processing of applications for citizenship.

Under Article 35.5 of the Constitution, a judge&rsquo;s salary may not be reduced except in the specific circumstances approved in last year&rsquo;s Referendum on Judges&rsquo; Pay.  There is, therefore, no legal provision to withhold a judge&rsquo;s pay while on sick leave.  Following the Referendum, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 which reduced the salary payable to a serving District Court Judge to &euro;136,124 (&euro;123,881 net of the pension related deduction), with effect from 1 January 2012.  Prior to 1 January 2012 the applicable salary was &euro;147,961.</p><p>  A judge&rsquo;s pension is calculated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions.  Pensions in respect of District Judges are based on 1/40th of salary per year of service up to a maximum period of twenty years.  A lump sum is calculated at 3/40ths of salary up to a maximum of 1.5 times salary.    Under the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) a person who has served a minimum of two years is entitled to apply for a preserved pension on reaching 65 years or if retiring on established medical grounds, a pro rata pension may be paid after five years.  Alternatively, a judge over the age of 60 who has served a minimum of two years may apply for Cost Neutral Early Retirement (provided for in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012).  Under this scheme benefits are payable immediately subject to cost neutral reduction on an actuarial basis.</p></reply>

A number of project groups established by the Working Group are taking forward a range of co-operation initiatives in relation to forensic science, registered offenders, probation and rehabilitation, victim support, youth justice matters and social diversity.</p><p>  Outside of the framework of the Intergovernmental Agreement, the officials of my Department maintain regular and productive interaction with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the various other Departments of the Northern Ireland Executive, depending on the particular issue at hand.

The successful operation of a statutory scheme for structured or periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the High Court Working Group Report on Periodic Payments recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle. The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals which I expect to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

Despite numerous attempts by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to extract DNA from the remains in an effort to generate DNA profiles, all attempts to date have proved unsuccessful.</p><p>  I am advised that the extraction of DNA profiles from bones that have been in water for a long period of time is extremely difficult as the sea has been found to cause extensive degrading of Nuclear DNA over time. In this regard, I am advised that Garda enquiries with the FSL indicate that further tests outside the jurisdiction may not necessarily be any more successful than testing that has taken place to date in the FSL.  I am also informed that new profiling technology will be introduced at the FSL, in early 2013, and it is expected that further tests will be carried out on the remains discovered off the Wexford coast using this technology.</p><p>  I am very much aware of the concerns which have been expressed in relation to these remains and my Department has conveyed these concerns to the Garda authorities. I am confident that in cases of missing persons, whether at sea or on land, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does all in its power to assist families of those who have been lost and, in particular, would contact families when they have any information of substance to impart.  The Government is committed to the early establishment of a DNA Database to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of crime.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, which will provide for the establishment and operation of the database, is currently being drafted and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill this session with a view to its enactment in 2013.</p></reply>

I hope that the remaining stages of the selection process will be completed shortly. Once the Selection Panel have made a decision and communicated that decision to the Government, the intention is that the successful applicants will meet the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. I also intend that the successful applicants will be appointed to the two existing bodies, pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger. This will ensure that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place, that the board(s) can commence preparing a Strategic Plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly on the staffing review envisaged in the Working Group Report.</p></reply>

This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos.  It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons.  I consider that an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options should be undertaken. It is therefore my intention to ask the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioners to examine the issue as a priority and to report on their views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House. I am committed to bringing forward Government proposals for any necessary anti-discrimination amendment to this provision once this consultation process is completed.</p></reply>

While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. I can, however, inform the Deputy that enormous progress has been made in dealing with the backlog and steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Members are paid these allowances on a 28 day roster basis, in arrears, with the payment process commencing at the beginning of each pay roster period in respect of work carried out during the previous period.  There are 13 such periods in each year and there are 13 payments made each year to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based on individual claims submitted by the members.  There are no plans at present to change this arrangement.</p><p>  The majority of members receive this payment on the third Thursday after the end of a particular roster period. In the case of the period which ends on December 9th, this would be due to be paid on 27th December. However, the year-end payrolls are brought forward due to such matters as extra bank holidays which occur during the Christmas and New Year periods, the testing of new computer software to cater for any budgetary changes, inputting of payroll reference data changes for 2013 and the high volume of payroll administration required at the Financial Year End. This in turn means that the payroll date of 27 December has to be brought forward to 20 December. The payroll data for that pay date must be submitted by 7 December 2012.</p><p>  This practice outlined above has always been the case and is not a new development.  Garda members always have and continue to receive 13 payments each year for 13 four week periods. It must be remembered that with regard to normal salary payments, Garda&iacute; are paid on a weekly basis and will receive their pay up to and including the pay day of 27 December before the end of the year. In fact, they will receive their salary payment for paydays 20 and 27    December in advance of Christmas on 18 and 20 December respectively.</p></reply>

Her work is much appreciated and she can be assured of my full support.  My Department also appreciates the work of the Ombudsman for Children.  Any issues relating to the health and welfare of children and young persons are treated with the utmost seriousness by my Department; Ms. Logan and the work of her Office are held in the highest of respect.</p><p>  In this context, in July of this year, I extended the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to include the examination of complaints from children detained in St Patrick's Institution. This is something she had been seeking for a number of years that previous Governments had refused to authorise. She can be assured of my Department's full support and will be facilitated in every way possible.  As you will be aware the Government committed, in the Programme for Government to remove 16 and 17 year old offenders completely from the adult prison system.  In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's ceased on 1st May, 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. The Government also sanctioned the provision of the necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown. This is due for completion in mid-2014.  These matters were all dealt with by me in cooperation with my colleague Frances Fitzgerald TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible. Arrangements are also being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St Patrick's Institution alongside Prison Staff. Discussions are ongoing between the officials of the Irish Prison Service, the youth Justice Service, St. Patrick's and Obsertown and it is intended that this will take place in the near future.  <b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p></reply>

However, a specific implementation plan for the strategy had not previously been developed. This Government is now addressing this.</p><p>  The Programme for Government states that &#8220;<i>the Government will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources and ensure whole of government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector&#8221;.  </i>I have established and am personally chairing a new group to develop a realistic implementation plan for progressing the Strategy, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. The new Group has replaced the previous National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group while maintaining the cross-departmental focus and the collaboration with stakeholders. The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group comprises representatives from across Government, a representative from the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.</p><p>  The aim of the Implementation Plan is, through engaging with the disability sector and building on the traditional problem-solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector, to make progress to achieve our common interests.  More targeted, innovative and flexible services, designed and delivered on the basis of the evidence drawn from systematic evaluation will help ensure that available resources, which are of course diminished across Government due to the current economic climate, are used to deliver services that meet the needs of the community as efficiently and effectively as possible.  This Implementation Plan will seek to ensure these resources are used as effectively as possible in ensuring that the living standards and access to essential services for people with disabilities are maintained.</p><p>  The Implementation Plan is developing well with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and Key Performance Indicators. Discussions are ongoing between the Disability Stakeholders Group and Government Departments in an effort to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. At the most recent meeting of the Implementation Group on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November it was agreed that every effort will be made to finalise the Plan at the next meeting of the Group which will be held in Quarter 1 of 2013. Once agreed, the Plan will be published as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>  The National Disability Authority is helping Departments in setting performance indicators and outcomes for the Plan&#8217;s targets and have held one-on-one meetings with Departments to assist them in identifying actions to be included in the Implementation Plan. Work by the Authority in relation to Disability Indicators is also at an advanced stage and will be signed off by the Senior Official&#8217;s Group and the Disability Stakeholder Group shortly. These indicators will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the plan translate into improved quality of life for people with disabilities.</p><p>  As part of the process of developing the Implementation Plan, the identification and recording of actions which will be required in order to ensure that Ireland will be in compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when ratification takes place is also being undertaken. Each action in the Plan will be linked to the Article of the Convention and obligations therein which will be met through implementation of that action.</p><p>  Outside of the Implementation Group, I also convened a Disability Forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to ensure the voices of people with disabilities, their needs and concerns are being heard. The first meeting of the Disability Forum, which was attended by over 300 people with disabilities, their carers, and family members was held on the 19<sup>th</sup> of June this year and a report of the views expressed will be published shortly. This report will form part of the considerations of the Implementation Group in relation to actions in the Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

Currently, RIA accommodates 4,822 asylum seekers at 35 accommodation centres throughout the State.  I do not accept the premise of the question that persons residing in the Direct Provision system are in extreme poverty.  The system is essentially cashless but no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; residents receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.</p><p>  To elaborate on these services,  it is worth noting the following.  Accommodation in reception and accommodation centres is provided on a full board basis which includes the provision of a room / family room (as appropriate) and three meals per day as well as school lunches.  All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State.  Residents are paid a weekly direct provision allowance.  In addition, asylum seekers can access exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowances. Parents may also apply for payments to allow their children to avail of school activities, sports and other activities. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework.</p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.</p><p>  An issue to be acknowledged is the length of time spent in the direct provision system. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.1123.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRU04000"><p>The Report of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was recently published, concluded that the current Reserve organisation required radical reform.  The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.  The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the current numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.</p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  You will appreciate that this smaller number of full sized Units, outside of PDF installations, must cover the entire country.  Amongst other considerations, the selection of locations for these Units sought to ensure continued opportunities for people throughout the country to serve in the Reserve.</p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  All Reserve Combat Support and Combat Service Support components will be co-located with their PDF &lsquo;Parent Unit&rsquo;.  Reserve personnel will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions in the new organisational structure that best suits their individual circumstances.  Every effort will be made to accommodate personnel within their geographic location and retraining will be available if required.  Whilst there will inevitably be disruption for certain individual members of the Reserve, this re-organisation is necessary in order to ensure the future viability of the Reserve.  The contribution of all members of the Reserve is valued by Government and I sincerely hope that all current members will continue to serve in the new organisation.</p></reply>

This was mainly due to delays in projects arising from unforeseen additional works and also changes arising from the Defence Forces re-organisation and the recommendations of the review of the Reserve Defence Force.    Due to the delays on these projects the Department has applied for a Deferred Surrender of Capital funds to 2013 to meet current year commitments which will not mature before year end.  It is expected that the remaining funding for 2012 will be spent by year end.</p></reply>

However, I will now set out the position in relation to this case.</p><p>  The person named was the subject of a Nitrates inspection by my Department, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, on 15 March 2012. This inspection recorded breaches relating to the Nitrates Regulations and also the requirement to maintain lands in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition.  As a result, a penalty of 25% was applied.  The person named was notified of this decision on 5th of April 2012 and of the right to seek a review. To date, no such request has been received.  However, this option remains open and my Department has forwarded the requisite application form to facilitate the person concerned.  The outcome of this review can, in due course, be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  I might add that I am acutely aware of the weather-related difficulties being experienced by farmers and my Department makes every effort to take account of this and other factors during inspections, insofar as EU rules allow. </p></reply>

The profile which is the best estimate of expenditure available at the time is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led schemes, the pattern of drawdown of Grants-in-Aid by State bodies, etc. A monthly report is prepared showing actual expenditure against the profile. </p><p>  The October Exchequer returns for my Department and show that the there are a number of budget lines, which are, for a variety of reasons, behind profile. I expect that in most cases expenditure will &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; before the end of the year.

I have since received a comprehensive report on the training courses provided by BIM and associated matters.  This report indicates that BIM does not provide training courses for activities that might be deemed outside its remit. The report further clarifies that training course costs are consistent with market charges, with the exception of the mandatory Basic Safety Training Course, a course which the Bord notes has contributed to the significant reduction in the number of fishermen lost at sea or seriously injured.  This course, I am advised, is provided free of charge in the United Kingdom.

I understand that Coillte produces forecasts of the gross standing volume of roundwood in its estate, which form the basis for the company&rsquo;s annual supply programme and its offer to its customers.  This forecasted volume is validated on an annual basis through Coillte&rsquo;s Roundwood Supply Document, which it shares with the wood industry, to ensure that Coillte meets its gross volume targets as set out in its Forecast.</p><p>  As part of its commitment, Coillte regularly, on a 5 year rolling basis, publishes a forecast of potential roundwood supply.  In the recent past this was done in 2000 (covering the 2000-2005 period), 2005 (covering the 2006-2010 period) and again in 2010 (covering the period 2011-2015).  The roundwood volumes documented in these Forecasts are gross standing volume in the wood i.e. volume down to 7cm top diameter.  I also understand that it is always made clear in the accompanying notes to Roundwood Supply Forecasts, each document represents an estimate of the gross standing volume in the period in broad timber dimension categories, i.e. top diameter class 7cm-13cm, 14cm-19cm and 20+cm.  The forecast is not of sawlog, pulpwood and other log products that enter a wood processing mill.</p><p>  As I mentioned, Coillte shares these Forecasts with its customers and the forecast figures go to make up the company&rsquo;s annual supply programme and its offer to their sawmill customers.  I consider that the investment in the development of processing facilities is a commercial decision for individual companies.</p></reply>

These include, inter alia, the possible impact to the timber industry, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company and its levels of employment  These issues each require detailed consideration.  Case studies of the sale of State owned forestry in other countries, including New Zealand, has formed part of the analysis to date.</p><p>  In relation to the supply of timber to the processing sector, the Government is committed to developing and managing Ireland&#8217;s forestry resource in a manner which will ensure sustainable output and growth into the future.  Total roundwood harvest during 2011 was approximately 2.7 million cubic metres. The <i>All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast</i>, published by my Department in 2011, estimates that annual net realisable roundwood volume production for the island of Ireland will increase to 6.17 million cubic metres by 2020.  Of this, approximately 2.5 million cubic metres (c. 40%) is expected to come from private sector forests.  These figures and particularly the increase in private timber production are excellent indicators for future growth in our forestry sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.1286.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRX02100"><p>Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98 presently imposes an EU minimum landing size (MLS) for crawfish of 95mm, but was originally enacted as a MLS of 110mm.  The EU Regulation was changed with effect from May 2001 to specify the present EU MLS of 95mm.  The EU Regulation permits Member States to enact national measures supplementing or going beyond the minimum requirements specified in the EU Regulation, provided they are restricted to the Member State&rsquo;s own fishing vessels or to persons established in that Member State.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 232 of 2006) prohibit the landing, transhipment, retention on board, or sale of crawfish below the national minimum landing size of 110mm.  Ireland enacted this higher national MLS in 2001 as it was considered that the lower EU MLS introduced in 2001 offered no conservation protection for the species which was suffering from severe over-fishing.  In addition to the national MLS, the Crawfish (Fisheries Management and Conservation) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 233 of 2006) prohibit the fishing for, retention on board or landing of crawfish caught by nets in two specified areas off the coasts of Kerry and Galway.</p><p>  My Department was notified in December 2010 of a complaint received through the EU PILOT system alleging that Ireland&rsquo;s national regulations for the management of the crawfish stock were in breach of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98, were discriminatory and were anti-competitive.  My Department responded in detail to the Commission refuting the allegations made and the Commission closed the PILOT case in December 2011, subject to receipt of a copy of the report of a review I had initiated of the management arrangements for Crawfish and submission to the Commission of any amending national regulations arising.</p><p>  On 24 May 2011, I announced that I had asked BIM and the Marine Institute to conduct a review of Ireland&rsquo;s technical conservation measures for crawfish, having regard to the negative and declining state of the crawfish stock, the undesirable by-catch of non-target and possibly protected species from the use of nets by some fishermen in fishing for crawfish, the apparent market preference for smaller crawfish, and the range of technical conservation measures for crawfish used internationally.  The Review was conducted in consultation with crawfish fishermen, shellfish buyers and other stakeholders.</p><p>  On 14 February 2012, I received the report of the Review, together with a more detailed scientific examination of the crawfish stock from the Marine Institute.  The Review Report is available on BIM&rsquo;s website.  I will arrange for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.  The Review Report made 7 recommendations for the future management of the stock.  It concluded that a reduction in the MLS to the EU minimum level of 95mm would lead to a circa 42% reduction in the reproductive potential of the stock and therefore could not be recommended unless this loss of reproductive potential was compensated by the introduction of a maximum landing size of 120mm.  This alternative measure would prohibit the landing of crawfish in excess of 120mm to create a reservoir of reproducing adult crawfish.  However, the Review identified significant risks in this alternative approach and said it could be recommended only in combination with the introduction of a mechanism to monitor and effectively control and, if necessary, reduce fishing effort on crawfish and then only in areas where it has been demonstrated that there is no discard mortality of crawfish in excess of the maximum landing size.  Having considered these recommendations I consider retention of the present MLS of 110mm to be appropriate at this time.  In this context, it is worth noting that the Review found that 110mm is in fact the most commonly adopted MLS in Northern Europe.</p><p>  The Review also emphasised the importance of retaining the crawfish netting prohibitions off Kerry and Galway and recommended that their coverage and the introduction of new closed areas be considered in 2012 in light of new or changed designations for cetaceans under the Habitats Directive.  It recommended that regulations governing the closed areas (S.I. 233 of 2006) be updated to enhance enforcement and my Department is presently working on this task.  Finally, it recommended the enhancement of monitoring of by-catch of cetaceans and seals in tangle nets in Natura 2000 sites.</p></reply>

If we are to ensure that farmers can be supported through periods of extreme price volatility, we have to first of all ensure that the CAP is properly funded.  Accordingly, I have been supporting the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in their ongoing efforts to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible in the negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).  We have said that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to freeze the CAP budget at 2013 levels in nominal terms is a reasonable starting point, and at the recent European Council the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible CAP deal in the MFF.</p><p>  As regards the market support measures themselves, the broad thrust of the Commission&rsquo;s CAP reform proposals is, in my view, generally acceptable, in that the proposals strike a good overall balance in providing an effective safety net.  The main support measures, including those of most relevance to Ireland, are retained, and the inclusion of exceptional measures, with flexible triggers, to overcome emergency circumstances is welcome, as are the transitional provisions which provide for the abolition of sugar quotas.  However, I have stated my preference for mandatory rather than the proposed discretionary intervention for beef and veal if the trigger price is reached, and for the continuation of mandatory APS for butter rather than the discretionary mechanism proposed by the Commission, given the role of APS as an important mechanism for easing seasonal supply pressures.  I have also supported colleagues who have indicated that a review of reference prices is warranted in order to bring them up to date with current market realities.</p><p>  On sugar quotas, I have been very clear in my support for the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to abolish quotas from 30 September 2015, but I have also made it clear that, in the event that the quota regime is extended, there should be no market control barriers to the re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry, catering for our national requirements.  Another key issue on which I have expressed concern relates to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to strengthen the role of producer organisations, associations of producer organisations and interbranch organisations.  While I agree that measures to strengthen the position of primary producers in the food chain are warranted, I believe we must be careful to ensure that such measures do not in any way prejudice the effective operation of the single market, which is an absolutely fundamental element both of the Treaties and of the CAP.</p></reply>

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies/bodies that hold funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC), has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.</p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding.  From January 2013 it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding involving six national organisations to CDYSB.  These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department.  The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC.  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.  Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.</p><p>  It  is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves.  It is estimated that the current arrangements for distribution of grants involve an average administration charge of approximately 5% at a total funding cost of the order of &euro;1.6m per annum.</p><p>  Every effort is being made by my Department to ensure that, in the administration of the funding allocations in the present challenging budgetary situation, the focus is maintained on the provision of the front line services for young people.  The VECs have a statutory role in the provision of youth services and there is no intention on the part of the Department to curtail this role.  Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened.  The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.  My Department will communicate further and hold discussions about the proposals for change with the remaining organisations that administer funding on its behalf during the course of 2013.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It has also been decided that the drafting of the legislation should provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency.  It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.</p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July of this year.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include those services that might, in the first instance, help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services the Task Force considered that the core services of the new Agency must include a broad based range of universal and targeted services with an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.</p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed of the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.  This work will be undertaken as a priority.</p><p>  I recently met with representatives from the Heads of the Psychology Services Ireland and with a delegation from the IMPACT trade union to discuss issues relating to the future governance and organisational arrangements for the provision of community based psychology services.  Our shared objective is to ensure that the optimal national governance and service delivery framework is in place to ensure the best possible outcomes for children and families and other clients who need to avail of this key service.  The views of the profession and its representatives will receive appropriate consideration as part of the impact analysis.</p></reply>

The objective is to support continuity and stability in family life.

The functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer into the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment.

The report illustrates the breadth, depth and value of the youth work sector in Ireland.  It indicates that the youth work sector received in excess of &euro;79 million in State support in 2011 for a range of youth programmes including programmes supported by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health.  The report highlights the contribution of volunteers in the youth work sector.</p><p>  In 2012, funding of &euro;56.806m has been provided by my Department to support the delivery of youth services and programmes through the different schemes which include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, Youth Information Centres, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, the Local Drugs Force Task Scheme and certain other programmes including Gaisce- the President&rsquo;s Award.</p><p>  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision and involve 1,400 paid staff and some 40,000 volunteers in 477 youth projects around the country.  The National Youth Council&rsquo;s report provides a comprehensive assessment of the value and contribution of youth work to the economy, to young people themselves and to the social fabric of Irish society. Its publication is timely and the finding have been brought to the attention of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  My Department is working on the determination of the funding allocations for 2013 for youth services and organisations.  Having regard to the substantial savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department is seeking to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  Furthermore, every effort is being made to ensure that the funding for local volunteer-led youth provision continues to be supported for youth clubs and groups which offer quality youth activities for some 100,000 young people throughout the country.</p></reply>

This programme requires that staff members acting as pre-school year leaders hold a childcare qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in the ECCE programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme. Staff working with children under the ECCE programme as pre-school assistants are not required to hold a specific qualification.  </p><p>  Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of providers which provides information in relation to the childcare sector.  According to Pobal's Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector 2011, there are in the region of 4,300 childcare services participating in the ECCE programme.</p><p>  Some 2,920 respondents provided information on the level of training/qualifications of some 17,000 staff working with children. The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the childcare service, show that 96% of these services have a least one staff member qualified to FETAC Level 5 or higher, 75.2% have at least one member qualified to FETAC Level 6 or higher and 34% have a least one member qualified to HETAC Level 7 or higher.  The number of services with one staff member qualified to HETAC Level 8 and above and HETAC Level 9 and above is 22.3% and 3.2% respectively. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department has commenced work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy and in the terms of reference, as approved by Government, I expressly included the need to consider &ldquo;a robust system of regulation and inspection&rdquo; for the new Early Years Strategy.  Part of this will include improving access to quality reliable information on services and performance.  The employment of suitably qualified staff is a matter for each individual childcare service.

It will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland&rsquo;s first children&rsquo;s strategy which was published in 2000.  This high-level policy framework will also facilitate the preparation of a number of more detailed strategies including Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy is under development and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013 and published soon thereafter.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.  I have appointed an Expert Advisory  Group to advise on the preparation of the Strategy.  The Group comprises external experts from a range of specialties, including paediatrics, early childhood care and education, child protection and public health nursing, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy of UCD.  </p><p>  The results of a public consultation undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is currently being analysed.   It is also proposed that there will be further focused consultation with key stakeholders in relation to the Early Years Strategy.</p></reply>

The main object of the Bill is to ensure that, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, the burden of costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthy and the less healthy, including between the young and the old. Committee Stage for this Bill has now been completed and<b></b>Report Stage is scheduled in the D&aacute;il for later today, 4th December. There is currently no mechanism available to reclaim this levy where persons cancel or downgrade their policy. It is, however, important to note that customers are free to cancel and change their policy at their renewal date without difficulty. One option that could be of additional benefit is the issuing of a certificate in the case of those wishing to switch policies during the course of the cover year, which   will arrange to have further considered in the context of additional legislation concerning risk equalisation next year. </p><p>  In the interim, the increased notification periods for new and changed existing products provided for in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 will protect the consumer by restricting the proliferation of products and product changes (there are 221 products on the market at present which is considered excessive) by limiting capacity of insurers to offer and withdraw contracts at very short notice. All customers should carefully consider the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market, so that their own needs are fully met.</p></reply>

There is no doubt about the role that vaccines have played in improving the health of children.  The development of new vaccines is very welcome.  A Health Technology Assessment which includes a cost benefit analysis is carried out prior to any new vaccine being considered. This has a vital role in ensuring that care technologies, including vaccines, are used in a manner appropriate to their ability to maximise health gain and achieve value for money.</p><p>  Should NIAC advice recommend the inclusion of a new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme in Ireland, my Department, in association with the National Immunisation Office will examine the issue. If it is subsequently decided that a vaccine should be included in the vaccination programme, the Health Service Executive, through the National Immunisation Office, initiates the procurement process.</p></reply>

The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery, with the targets that no adult should be waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case treatments and no child longer than 20 weeks.  </p><p>  The measures being taken are working; by the end of September the number of adults waiting more than nine months had fallen by more than 90% on the figure at the start of the year (4678 in Jan down to 415 in September) while the number of children waiting longer than 20 weeks nationally was down to 276 from 1,844 at the start of the year.   </p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority, which is why for the first time, clear and comprehensive data on this problem is being reported. The data being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013. In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. </p><p>  There is no intention to impose financial penalties on hospitals in relation to achieving waiting time targets. The SDU will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF in order to ensure that waiting time targets are met. The HSE is also continuing to work closely with the hospitals that are operating budget deficits to ensure that the service impact of cost containment is kept to a minimum and to ensure that patient safety remains at the core of all decision making. The focus at all times is to achieve savings by obtaining better value for money and by continuing to introduce efficiencies in how hospitals do their business.</p></reply>

These changes have been introduced with effect from 1 November 2012 and should have some effect on staff with a high incidence of such absences;</p><p>-   From January 2014, certified sick-leave for circumstances other than critical illness will be halved to a maximum of 3 months on full pay followed by 3 months on half-pay in a rolling 4 year period;</p><p>-   The new arrangements will introduce a critical illness provision of 6 months on full pay and 6 months on half pay.</p><p>  The reduced self-certified sick leave should have a positive effect on staff behaviour, with a consequent improvement in the absenteeism rates.  The prospect of more restrictive rules on certified absence from 2014 may also help.  However, regardless of the new rules, minimising the incidence of sick-leave absence has to be the subject of a clear and sustained management focus and the HSE is pursuing this, especially in locations and services which clearly have unacceptable levels of sick absence.  As the specific question raised is a service issue I have arranged it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Legislation to allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department and it will be published shortly. Implementation dates and application details will be announced in due course.  An annual budget of &euro;15 million was provided for the first phase of the roll out of GP care without fees.  </p></reply>

In this context, the NSP 2012 provides for the replication nationally of the model operational in the HSE's North East Area, managed by the National Counselling Service (NCS), as a way of meeting the requirement to improve access to psychological therapies in Primary Care.  The cost of this extended service has been estimated at &#8364;5 million annually.</p><p>  To implement the model nationally, an additional Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) counsellor will be allocated to each of the 10 National Counselling Services.  These counsellors will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals.  The  10 posts were advertised recently for a national panel.  Interviews have now been completed and the results will be issued shortly.  The start dates for these posts are expected to be in early 2013 to allow for the process of checking references etc.  </p><p>  The actual counselling services required will be procured through the two employment agencies that hold the existing national contracts with the HSE and counsellors will be recruited through a two stage process.  The employment agencies will select counsellors using their own selection process with reference to qualifications and identify them as suitable for the service.  The HSE will then quality assure the proposed counsellors in terms of professional skills and knowledge prior to entering into the service.  Discussions with the contracted agencies have already begun on these points.  It is expected that this new service will begin to be rolled out early next year when the 10 coordinator counsellors are in place.  With regard to the level of funding for mental health next year, this is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2013 which is currently underway.</p></reply>

The HSE engaged with SIPTU concerning the recommendation and advised that as part of the process it would be undertaking an information-gathering exercise to ascertain the up-to-date position regarding the nature of the contracts held by home helps and the hours worked under such contracts. This exercise is currently at an advanced stage.</p><p>  Having met with the parties again on 15 October 2012, the Labour Court recommended that they should re-engage under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC).

The Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, consequently the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has, at present, no remit in relation to inspecting these services.  The Government is however, committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspection of services by HIQA.</p><p>  HIQA have developed and published draft National Standards for Residential Centres for People with Disabilities which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  </p><p>  My Department has been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed. The 10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved. My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.</p><p>  Other countries which have water fluoridation schemes include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Water fluoridation is less common in Europe, where fluoridated salt is often available as an alternative, although some populations are supplied with naturally fluoridated public water.</p></reply>

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &#8364;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.</p><p>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting. Except in certain circumstances,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  the additional 14 single inpatient rooms when required will be located in the Nutley Wing and these rooms will be grouped together as far as possible. 1-2 inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing will be kept available at all times for emergency admissions. In circumstances where the emergency admission rooms have already been utilised and all the other inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing are occupied, patients with CF will be accommodated elsewhere  in clinically appropriate single rooms until such time as a room becomes available in the Nutley Wing and then the patient will be transferred there as a priority.</p><p>  Last week, the CFAI raised concerns with the hospital about CF patients waiting for admission to SVUH. The hospital has advised that the patients in question have all been admitted. The position with regard to the facilities in St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin for patients with Cystic Fibrosis is being continuously monitored. The hospital has confirmed it is very happy to work with the CFAI to carry out a review of the management of CF beds at St Vincent&#8217;s and a series of meetings have been held recently in an effort to develop robust protocols and policies to meet the needs of patients with Cystic Fibrosis who are acutely ill and require admission to the hospital.  These will be finalised by the relevant parties shortly. In the meantime, interim measures are in place to deal with any surge requirement. </p></reply>

Work on the latter regime is being progressed in conjunction with Northern Ireland; preparations are well underway to tender jointly for a health impact assessment to be carried out - a measure that would be key to underpinning any regime of minimum unit pricing given the prospects for such a policy to be challenged.  As minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption.  Moreover, and arising from the Armagh conference, a North South Alcohol Forum has been initiated and has already met for the purposes of developing areas of work to be elaborated.</p><p>  The Deputy's question relating to the inclusion of alcohol on the agenda of Ireland's Presidency is indeed pertinent given that the prospect for a new European Union Strategy on Alcohol is being discussed at European Union level.  Ireland is actively participating in this discussion. </p><p>  My Department is developing concrete proposals on the basis of the recommendations of the report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group - including the recommendations on a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry and a regime of minimum unit pricing; and these are being prepared for the purposes of submitting them to Government at the earliest opportunity for the consideration and approval of the Cabinet.  While this work is continuing, the prospects for encompassing work on alcohol during the tenure of Ireland's Presidency are against the backdrop of many competing priorities on the health agenda.While, I am conscious of the need to  develop proposals on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland, there are no plans at this stage to organise an event on alcohol during Ireland's Presidency.</p></reply>

Some organisations provide services for a specific group of children who have a particular kind of disability, or they only operate in one part of the country.  This means that there is considerable variation in children's access to services within regions and across the country. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive has recognised that the current system lacks equity and acknowledges that there is a need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  To this end it is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This Programme aims to achieve a national unified approach to the delivery of disability services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. </p><p>  The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multi-disciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years.</i>  Importantly, while the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises the continuing role of special schools.  It is worth noting that therapy services in the HSE Mid-West region are already delivered through the structure of geographically based multi-disciplinary teams and that this has enabled two Special Schools to access multi-disciplinary supports which had previously not been available.  It is common across Europe and elsewhere to have children seen by their local early intervention and school age services whatever the nature of their disability or developmental delay, for example in Bavaria or in the UK.</p><p>  The Programme is being led by the HSE in partnership with the non-statutory disability organisations, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and associated agencies.  It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, voluntary service providers and parents through their umbrella organisations.  At regional level there are Regional Leads for the Programme in each of the four HSE Regions. Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of Local Implementation Groups.  These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives.  </p><p>  The active engagement of stakeholders is a critical element of any change process and implementation of the Programme will involve broad consultation.  No individual or agency representative will have a veto in this regard.  Information on the Programme has been made available widely through the HSE website, bulletins, workshops, and presentations.  The National Advocacy Unit of the HSE has developed guidelines for the reimbursement of expenses for service users participating in the design, development and delivery of services.  These guidelines apply to the participation of parents in the development of this Programme.</p><p>  Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the Local Implementation Groups with the following objectives:</p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;</p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;</p><p> - Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The Local Implementation Groups will make informed decisions on the optimum use of existing resources, based on local information about resources and the needs of children in their area.  Children will get access to services within existing resources according to their needs regardless of where they go to school.  It is the Local Implementation Groups that will decide how best to phase in the changes in accordance with local conditions.  Significant progress has been made since the Programme was established in 2010.  The HSE envisages that full implementation of the Programme nationally will take two to three years to complete. </p></reply>

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.</p><p>  For adults, the target is that no-one should be waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case treatments. Overall, by the end of September progress towards the target is strong &ndash; the number waiting more than nine months has fallen by more than 90% on the figure at the start of the year (4678 in Jan down to 415 in September).  For children, the target is that by the end of 2012 no child should be waiting for inpatient or daycase treatment for more than 20 weeks. Again, huge progress has been made towards this target &ndash; by the end of September the number of children waiting longer than 20 weeks nationally was down to 276 from 1,844 at the start of the year. </p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.

In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>   (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; </p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>   (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where, for example, any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p><p>  It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012. The Bill completed its passage through the Seanad on Wednesday, the 19th   of September, and is currently continuing its passage through the D&aacute;il. An Implementation Group on Generic Substitution and Reference Pricing has been established and it held its inaugural meeting on the 9th of August 2012. The Group met with the Irish Epilepsy Association, amongst others, on the 20th of November as part of its stakeholder meetings.</p></reply>

Assuming an annual birth rate between 70,000 and 75,000 the total cost of providing free GP care to all children under one year is provisionally estimated at between &euro;10.5m and &euro;11.5m.

The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.</p><p>  For adults, the target is that no-one should be waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case treatments.  Overall, by the end of September progress towards the target is strong &ndash; the number waiting more than nine months has fallen by more than 90% on the figure at the start of the year (4678 in Jan down to 415 in September).  For children, the target is that by the end of 2012 no child should be waiting for inpatient or daycase treatment for more than 20 weeks.  Again, huge progress has been made towards this target &ndash; by the end of September the number of children waiting longer than 20 weeks nationally was down to 276 from 1,844 at the start of the year. </p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.

The remuneration for Tribunal members is approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A briefing fee, payable on a once-off basis, when new members take up their respective appointments, is &euro;10,000.  This was reduced from &euro;17,526 in June, 2012.  In addition, members receive a daily rate of &euro;845.00 plus VAT per sitting day.  This was reduced from &euro;992.68 plus VAT in June, 2012. </p><p>  The Tribunal carries out judicial type functions and is therefore very different to a typical State Board.  It hears claims in relation to persons infected with Hepatitis C or HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  Claims are dealt with by the Tribunal by way of an in camera oral hearing before two members of the Tribunal and the Chairperson.  The Tribunal was set up in order that claimants could have their cases heard in a confidential, person centred, fashion.  The brief fee reflects the considerable work that each new member must undertake to familiarise themselves with the Tribunal process, the outcome of previous Tribunal hearings and precedents set to ensure a level of consistency among claims heard.</p></reply>

It is based on eight principles which underpin high quality, people-centred care. </p><p>  The National Advocacy Unit has delivered information sessions to 40 acute hospital and community services in 2012 on the following: </p><p>1) implementing the National Healthcare Charter </p><p> 2) improving patient experience </p><p> 3) developed resources aimed at both staff and patients to promote concepts outlined in the National Healthcare Charter </p><p> 4) using patient feedback to inform quality improvement </p><p> 5) being accountable for quality improvements made based on patient feedback </p><p> 6) working closely with clinical programmes, using patient feedback to inform the design, development and evaluation of the clinical programmes </p><p> 7) developing training for staff which uses patient stories to demonstrate what has worked well and what requires improvement </p><p>  Other work and initiatives of the National Advocacy Unit include:</p><p>  - Development of 'It&#8217;s safer to ask' leaflet, which aims to empower patients and service users to ask questions and get the information that they require.</p><p>  - Development of 'You said we did' webpage, which uses specific examples of how patient feedback was used to introduce quality improvement.</p><p>  - Introduction of the Open Disclosure policy and roll out of training.</p><p>  - Facilitating setting up of the Patient Safety Champions network, which is based on the World Health Organisation initiative, Patients for Patient Safety. Expressions of interest were received and a workshop will be held in early 2013.</p></reply>

The new unit, which is due to open in 2016, will provide more locally accessible and timely services and improve travelling times for patients in the North Western area.  Information evenings were held in Altnagelvin Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital on the 8 and 9 October respectively to inform hospital staff, voluntary agencies and the general public about the development. </p><p><b>Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Services</b></p><p>  Whilst paediatric congenital cardiac services can be provided safely in the short term in Belfast, these services will change in 2013 on the grounds of safety and sustainability.  These changes are the subject of public consultation which will close on 21 December 2012.  Our Ladys Children's Hospital, Crumlin, is one of 7 sites that have been identified as potential service providers for patients from Northern Ireland, and the only site which can viably provide an 'all island' solution.  These services would build on the existing service provided by Crumlin to patients from Northern Ireland (thus far in 2012, a total of 23 procedures have been performed).  Contacts are continuing between all of the appropriate stakeholders with a view to determining as soon as possible how best an all Island service might be established and how soon this could be realised if it is determined, through public consultation, to be the optimum solution.</p><p><b>Health Promotion</b></p><p>Co-operation on Health Promotion issues continues to progress.  Following on  from a successful North South Alcohol Conference in January the first meeting of the North-South  Alcohol forum was held in October.  The aim of the forum is to contribute to reducing alcohol related harm on the island of Ireland.  The Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group is at an advanced stage of preparation; and in the North/South context there is significant scope for sharing data and conclusions &#8211; in particular prevalence rates of tobacco use by gender; smoking related health care costs; percentage of death attributable to tobacco by gender etc.  The All-island Obesity Action Forum was established in December 2008 to support the implementation of obesity policies in both jurisdictions.  The Forum brings together a wide range of stakeholders from over 31 different organisations and meets twice yearly. </p><p><b>Cancer Research</b></p><p>  Under the Ireland - Northern Ireland - National Cancer Institute in the US Cancer Consortium, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed last December which aims to enhance cooperation and partnership and thereby enable improved fundamental and clinical research programmes and translation of research findings into healthcare delivery.  Five workstream areas have been identified under the Consortium: Capacity Building for Research; Public Health &amp; Wellbeing/Prevention/Health Promotion (to include population-health research); Nursing; Palliative and end-of-life care; and Survivorship.  Experts from each jurisdiction are working together in these workstreams to optimise the research potential in these areas.  </p><p><b>Food Safety</b></p><p>The Food Safety Promotion Board performs a wide range of consumer and scientific activities aimed at increasing consumer and scientific knowledge and promoting food safety and healthy eating within disadvantaged communities in both North and South.  As well as its ongoing work on the <i>All-island Obesity Forum</i> and on <i>Community Food Initiatives Programmes</i>  , some of its more recent achievements include a report profiling nutritional information on  Chinese takeaway food, a report on emerging food safety issues and a joint food waste campaign across both jurisdictions aimed at improving consumers awareness of the cost of food waste and increasing their understanding of the difference between &quot;best before&quot; and &quot;use by&quot; dates.  </p><p><b>Suicide Prevention</b></p><p>  In relation to suicide prevention, an all-island Suicide Prevention Action Plan which contains a rolling programme of actions has been agreed.  Progress has been made in relation to a number of collaborative projects which include training and education (with the evaluation and roll out of the ASIST programme), updating the all-island media guidelines; the commencement of the All-Island Men&#8217;s Health Forum and the roll-out of the all island Registry of Deliberate Self Harm.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention has developed self harm awareness training and an online training programme for GPs and practice based staff and these will be shared with colleagues in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  I am happy that  my Department and the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety( DHSSPS) can co-operate on a wide range of health issues and I look forward to this continuing in the future.</p></reply>

I am considering a range of measures to halt this increase.  I am aware that is evidence that Sugared Sweetened Drinks contribute to weight gain because of their high added sugar content, low satiety, and potential incomplete compensation for total energy, leading to increased energy intake.  The World Health Organisation has serious concerns over the high and increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks by children in many countries. Children who drink one regular carbonated drink a day have an average 10% more total energy than non-consumers. It has been estimated that each additional can or glass of sugar-sweetened drink that children consume every day increases the risk of becoming obese by 60%.</p><p>  For these reasons, I have been considering a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy and the need to provide an evidence base. I asked my Department to establish a Steering Group to oversee the carrying out a Health Impact Assessment on the health and economic aspects of introducing a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy.  The Health Impact Assessment Report has been completed and was presented to me recently by the Special Action Group on Obesity. I am considering the results of the Health Impact Assessment and recommendations of the Special Action Group on Obesity and am using them as part of the decision making process regarding any possible introduction of a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks.</p></reply>

I am considering a range of measures to halt this increase. I established a Special Action Group on Obesity in 2011 and one of the measures being pursued at the moment is Calorie Posting on menu boards in fast food restaurants and coffee shops.  The Special Action Group on Obesity identified this as a priority action which could have a positive impact in addressing the problem of our rising levels of overweight and obesity.</p><p>  In October 2011 and January 2012, I wrote to Fast Food chains and sandwich bars operating in Ireland to request that they introduce calorie posting in their restaurants and sandwich bars as quickly as possible. I have met with a number of these organisations and they, along with others, are now providing calories on menus.  To take this initiative further, the Department of Health commissioned the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to conduct a public consultation on the introduction of calorie posting on fast food outlet and restaurant menus. The consultation process shows that both the general public and the food outlets were positive about this initiative.</p><p>  Work is ongoing and the FSAI are currently looking at options on how best to support food outlets in calculating calories on dishes that appear more than 30 days on menus. An assessment is under way and this is being facilitated by the FSAI. The Special Action Group on Obesity<b></b>will then consider progress in this area and make a recommendation to me regarding next steps.</p></reply>

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months.</p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so.</p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.   In relation to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

If we were to make the wearing of reflective clothing mandatory, we would need to create a criminal offence under Road Traffic legislation for any person guilty of not wearing a high visibility jacket.  Persons in breach of the provision would have to be issued with a fixed charge notice by a Garda or summonsed to court depending on whatever administrative procedure would be put in place for the processing of such offences.  At this stage, I believe that would be a disproportionate response to the issue.</p><p>  In my view, safety issues such as these are best addressed by way of educational and publicity campaigns, such as those undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), which has responsibility for the promotion of road safety awareness, advertising and the dissemination of road safety information.  The RSA is engaged on an ongoing basis in efforts to change our cultural attitude to road safety through advertising, publicity, education and community initiatives.  As part of this process it has undertaken a number of campaigns to promote awareness among pedestrians of the need for visibility on our roads.  Ultimately, the safety of all road users is a matter of personal responsibility.  In that context, the Rules of the Road include a strong recommendation supporting the wearing of light and preferably high-visibility clothing.</p></reply>

This adjustment does not envisage any reduction in the overall number of volunteer members, nor enforced retirement of currently serving volunteers. Significantly, the review recommends retention of the existing geographical base of volunteer membership of the Coast Guard.   My Department is currently developing an Action Plan in response to this and other issues which were raised in the VFM review on the Coast Guard, and a related VFM on the Marine Survey Office. I will be seeking Governmental approval in the coming weeks for this Action Plan. In relation to the amalgmation of Coast Guard units, while there may be merit on the basis outlined within the VFM review, I will not be proposing to Government to force Volunteer Coast Guard Units to amalgmate against the wishes of the volunteers themselves. Any such amalgmation would only be on the basis that it was supported by the membership of both units.</p><p>  With regard to the Volunteer Units in Ballycotton and Guileen, they are very close to each other, approximately ten miles apart, and the Coast Guard managment is considering how the local Coast Guard serives might be developed through bringing the two Units together. All Coast Guard teams are shoreline search units and are also equipped with modern blue light emergency response vehicles. In addition, Ballycotton is also a highly specialised Cliff Rescue Unit. The Coast Guard recognises the importance of retaining a vibrant Cliff Rescue facility for east Cork coupled with a Shoreline Search unit in the coastline area between the east side of Cork Harbour and Knockadoon Head. </p><p>  Coast Guard management are consulting with the two units with a view to developing an amalgamation plan supported by members of both Units that retains the existing geographical membership base. Should this result in the successful amalgamation of the two units it would afford existing and new members from the Guileen area an opportunity to develop additional skills in Cliff rescue and facilitate the development of a fit for purpose building serving the combined needs of the area. A single Cliff Rescue and Search Unit would provide for an enhanced capacity to provide a more effective life-saving response in the area coupled with an increased capacity to support  the other statutory land based emergency services.</p><p>  However, as outlined above and as I have discussed with the Deputy previously, Volunteer Units will not be amalgmated against the will of the membership of those units. In the case that the Volunteer Units in Ballycotton and Guileen do not see merit in an amalgmation, then it will  not be forced upon them.</p></reply>

The timeframe for introducing taxi branding as proposed in the Review Report, signalled that this action would be rolled-out within a year. </p><p>  Responsibility for the implementation of this recommendation falls under the ambit of the National Transport Authority (NTA) as does the date of its proposed introduction. I understand that the NTA has, since October, supplied information on its website concerning the taxi branding, which will be an application requirement for new vehicle licences and renewal of existing vehicle licences from January 2013.

This sum, which is the figure in the Updated Detailed Business Case, is of necessity an estimate and reflects the current pre-tender stage of project definitions, design and development.

For instance in many jurisdictions the very significant cost of the necessary utility diversions from the route of the light rail project do not form part of the project cost, as they do in Ireland, and instead are borne directly by the utility owner. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-04a.1723.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012120400071#WRFF03500"><p>At yesterday&rsquo;s major conference on Irish civil aviation policy I announced that the Government has confirmed its decision in principle of last May to separate Shannon Airport from the DAA and merge it with a restructured Shannon Development.  This decision will free the board and management of Shannon airport, together with their employees, to bring a fresh approach to the future development of the airport. A key element of that future will be the development of an International Aviation Services Centre (IASC) in and around the airport, building on a range of aviation-related activities already undertaken in Shannon such as aircraft maintenance and leasing.</p><p>  In addition to initiative on State airports, I have also rationalised the system of State support for regional airports and the Government now has a settled policy in relation to these airports. All Irish airports should operate to a commercial mandate and I have stressed in the past that regional airports, including Knock airport, must work towards achieving operational viability over the near term.  </p><p>   Knock Airport, along with the other regional airports which are not owned by the State, has been supported over the years under the Regional Airports Programme which is aimed at ensuring balanced regional development.  Under that programme, Knock Airport has received around &euro;40m since 1993. This includes funding for the PSO air services, which although paid directly to the airlines, also supports the airport.  Over &euro;1m is being provided this year to the Airport, despite the difficult economic circumstances of the country.  </p><p>  As was highlighted again at yesterday&rsquo;s conference, aviation is a key component to all major forms of economic activity in Ireland, including tourism and our other business sectors.  The measures we are taking are based on increasing the overall number of passengers to and from Ireland through increased efficiencies and the attraction of new aviation business that can have a beneficial national impact.  I believe that these measures will form the basis for sound, sustainable, airport businesses into the future that will support the growth of these sectors and help drive Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. </p></reply>

The Review Group proposed under Action 34 that taxi industry representative groups may make a referral to the Taxi Advisory Committee in relation to the introduction of industry regulations. In addition, Action 35 of the Review Report proposes that a sub-committee of the Taxi Advisory Committee will be formed to act as a forum for the taxi sector when considering issues of particular concern to the sector. I understand that a number of taxi representative bodies have already this year made presentations to the Taxi Advisory Committee and that the taxi representatives in question have recently met with the Chairman of the Taxi Advisory Committee.</p><p>  Prior to the Taxi Review, I spent considerable time consulting the various taxi representative groups and gave them considerable time to hear their views. The Taxi Review Group, which I Chaired, also invited written and oral presentations to be made by the industry stakeholders and representative bodies. I believe that representation of the taxi sector is far too fragmented and this is a disadvantage in terms of the development of policy. Therefore, I support any efforts by the various representative bodies to consolidate in order to provide a broader representation of taxi drivers&rsquo; interests.</p></reply>

I understand that there has been extensive engagement between the NTA, the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), An Garda Siochana, Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the business community aimed at minimising the construction impacts of LUAS Broombridge.  While there will be traffic diversions and public transport changes, well developed plans are being put in place to minimise the impacts of these changes on businesses, commuters, shoppers, residents as well as tourists visiting the city during <i>The Gathering </i>  next year.</p><p>  Undoubtedly there will be some level of inconvenience during the construction of the project.  However, all parties involved with LUAS Broombridge are committed to managing the construction activities in a manner that balances the need to deliver a vitally important project for Dublin with the need to support the continued economic functioning of the city.  </p><p>  I am determined that this balance will be achieved and I have undertaken to chair a committee comprising the NTA, RPA, An Garda Siochana, Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the business community to monitor key aspects of the construction activity. The first meeting of this group will take place shortly.  Unlike the position of just over a decade ago, there is now a depth of experience in Ireland in the delivery of large infrastructure projects and I am confident that we have the capability of delivering this significant project while retaining Dublin City&#8217;s attractiveness for shopping, tourism and business.</p></reply>
