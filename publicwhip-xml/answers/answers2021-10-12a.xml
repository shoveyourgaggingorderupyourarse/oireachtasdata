    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-12a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101200059#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 8 together.</p>  <p>The powers and functions of the Attorney General are set out at Article 30 of the Constitution and in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  The role of the Attorney General is to advise the Government in matters of law and legal opinion, and to this end, his Office comprises of a number of different functions in providing services to the Government.</p>  <p>  A core function of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office involves the handling of, and providing advice relating to, litigation involving the State.  In such cases the instructing solicitor is the Chief State Solicitor.  As the Deputy will appreciate there are very many such live cases and, as would be expected, the Attorney General has been personally involved in providing and approving advices in respect of these cases.</p>  <p>  I would note that the Attorney General, in common with many of his predecessors, has personally represented the State in a number of cases before the courts since his appointment.  The Attorney General had previously represented the State in a private capacity in the Apple tax case and he has continued to represent the State in this case since his appointment.  He has also represented the State in the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice since his appointment.</p>  <p>  Prior to his appointment in June 2020, the Attorney General informed me and I informed the other leaders of the parties in Government that he had a small number of existing litigation commitments that he considered he had a professional obligation to discharge, and it was agreed that he would do so.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General&rsquo;s involvement in these matters dates back to 2011 in one case and 2017 in two others.  The first matter related to the State recapitalisation of Irish Permanent.  The Attorney General was involved in one hearing in that matter in November 2020 and his involvement ceased at that time.  The second matter related to a commercial dispute and the Attorney General's involvement ceased in February 2021.  The final matter related to the Inspectors investigation into certain matters relating to INM and involved a hearing on two Saturdays, 18 and 25 September 2021.  The Attorney General's involvement in that matter ceased on 25 September. </p>  <p>  In the normal course of events these private professional obligations would have been discharged in a short period of time following his appointment.  However, due to the Covid pandemic there were exceptional delays in the hearings of those aspects of the litigation in which the Attorney General was involved, and it was not possible to discharge these obligations as early as anticipated.</p>  <p>  While I have responsibility for answering questions on administrative matters connected with the Office of the Attorney General, I have no function in respect of the detail of the Attorney General&rsquo;s professional engagements outside of his role as Attorney General.  I would note also that the Attorney General is bound by a duty of confidentiality to his clients and that he has no continuing private professional obligations.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that I am fully satisfied no conflict of interest arises in this regard.  Having acted in those three matters in a private capacity the Attorney General could never have acted for the State in these or any related matters.  It is the long-standing practice that if an Attorney General has a conflict of interest in relation to any case, such cases are not dealt with by the Attorney General but rather they are advised on by the Director General of the Office of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

My Department does, however, play a leadership role in the Shared Island Fund, a key Programme for Government commitment which is an element of the NDP.</p>  <p>  The revised NDP sets out the capital investment plans over the decade ahead to deliver on our strategic priorities, including in education, health, and regional development and to address the most important challenges we face &ndash; particularly in relation to housing, sustainability and climate action. </p>  <p>  It also sets an enhanced level of ambition for collaborative cross-border public investment, to build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island, for all communities and traditions that share the island. This includes increased funding through the Shared Island Fund, being led by my Department and which combined with other public funding brings the total all-island investment commitment for the 2021-2030 period to more than &euro;3.5 billion. The Shared Island Fund is allocated by Government to Departments on the basis of approved collaborative North/South projects. As is normal, the Secretary General of the Government Department to which funding is allocated will be the Accounting Officer.</p>  <p>  This revised NDP is being delivered within Project Ireland 2040, the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of our country. Since its launch in February 2018, through the first phase of the NDP, significant progress has been made on implementation. Detail on progress can be found on the myProjectIreland interactive map available on Gov.ie [www.gov.ie/en/collection/f828b-myprojectireland-interactive-map/]</p></reply>

In all cases, the allocation of resources is subject to planning approval and compliance with all other applicable environmental law, regulatory and public expenditure requirements for the project concerned.</p><p>Projects funded under the NDP will be subject to planning law and may require Strategic Environmental Assessment. Each Government Department is responsible for ensuring that its proposed projects meet the appropriate regulatory requirements including those related to planning laws and environmental impact assessments.</p><p>The NDP sets an enhanced level of ambition for collaborative cross-border public investment, to build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island, for all communities and traditions that share the island.</p><p>The allocations for the Shared Island Fund for the period 2021-2025 are set out in tabular form below. Under the NDP, the Government has committed to allocate ring-fenced, multi-annual capital resourcing for all-island investment out to 2030, at least at the current level of the Shared Island Fund. The Shared Island Fund is allocated by Government to Departments on the basis of approved collaborative North/South projects that implement Programme for Government commitments and objectives on Shared Island.</p><p>As set out in tabular form below, the Government&rsquo;s annual funding contribution for the six North South Implementation Bodies and Tourism Ireland and other North South cooperation or all-island funding in 2021 is over &euro;129m. This will be at least maintained over 2021-2030, representing a ten-year commitment in current funding terms of over &euro;1.294billion.</p><p>The PEACE PLUS programme is being finalised at present, and will provide over &euro;1billion in funding over the period 2021-27, delivered by the Government with the European Union, UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive. The Government will also continue to contribute to the PEACE IV and INTERREG VA programmes as they conclude in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with a contribution of &euro;39.19m in 2021.</p><p>While specific allocations have not yet been made, Project Ireland 2040 funding will support key cross-border infrastructure projects noted in the NDP, including the A5 Transport Corridor to the North West, the Ulster Canal renovation, cross-border greenways, including the Sligo Enniskillen greenway, all-island research centres, and the upgrade of the Dublin-Belfast rail connection to an hourly service, including new rolling stock. </p><p>For 2021-2030, there is a total all-island investment commitment of more than &euro;3.5billion through the Shared Island Fund, the Project Ireland 2040 funds, the Government&rsquo;s annual funding for North/South cooperation, and the PEACE PLUS programme delivered with the EU, UK and the Northern Ireland Executive.</p><p><b>National Development Plan allocations (&euro;m)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2022 </th>       <th>2023 </th>       <th>2024 </th>       <th>2025 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shared Island Fund</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Government funding for North/South Bodies and all-island cooperation </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2021 budget / contribution</th>       <th>(&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Food Safety Promotion Board</td>       <td>5.236</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission</td>       <td>2.946</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTradeIreland</td>       <td>11.246</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Languages Body</td>       <td>12.790</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special EU Programmes Body (core funding)</td>       <td>1.055</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tourism Ireland</td>       <td>48.729</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterways Ireland </td>       <td>28.928</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Reconciliation Fund </td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>International Fund for Ireland</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>All-island and cross-border Healthcare cooperation (2020)</td>       <td>4.159</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Education cooperation, including Middletown Centre (2020)</td>       <td>2.252</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>US-Ireland R&amp;amp;D partnership programme (2020)</td>       <td>6.099</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;129.44m</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews.  The reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market.  Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments.  Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are represented on the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, my Department introduced a pilot quota-based scheme to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  This pilot scheme proved very successful. These three quotas have been filled.</p>  <p>  The current review of the occupations lists is drawing to a close with submissions received from a range of sectors - including from the pig industry &ndash; considered during the process. It is expected that the final report on the review will be submitted for approval shortly and any changes necessary to deal with verified skills or labour shortages will be made in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The location of data centres in Ireland plays a significant role in Ireland&rsquo;s technology sector, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation as a digital hub and as a high-quality investment location. Ireland has an extremely valuable Information Technology (IT) sector which accounts for &euro;52 billion (16%) of gross value add in the Irish economy and employs 140,000 people, equivalent to 6% of total national employment and representing 40% growth over the last five years. Data centres are a critical infrastructure for strengthening and advancing Ireland&rsquo;s position as a strategic international location for IT services and for developing both Ireland&rsquo;s and Europe&rsquo;s digital economies. </p><p>Since the publication of the Statement, there have been significant policy and market developments with implications for the data centre infrastructure in Ireland. My Department is committed to revising the Statement to reflect the new enterprise context, security of energy supply issues and align it with our renewable energy targets and priorities, in the forthcoming Climate Action Plan 2021. </p><p>The revision to the statement will take account of several key related workstreams underway in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications for which the output is due shortly. These include the publication of Eirgrid&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Shaping our Electricity Future&rsquo;</i>analysis and strategic approach to grid development; the SEAI-led work on a policy framework for Corporate Power Purchase Agreements and the policy interventions that can be brought forward; publication of Climate Action Plan 2021, which will set out the measures to move toward a decarbonised energy system and the final system design in 2030 which will inform how data centres can best adapt and contribute to decarbonisation; and the publication of the review of wider Security of Supply issues in the electricity sector. </p><p>My Department will work closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the revision to the <i>Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy.</i></p></reply>

The commitment to introduce legislation to underpin employees' right to request remote work was made in the national Remote Work Strategy published last January. </p>  <p>  The Bill will set out a clear framework to facilitate remote and blended work options, in so far as possible. It will ensure that when an employer declines a request, there are stated reasons for doing so. Remote working won&rsquo;t work for everyone, so we will take a balanced approach with the legislation.</p>  <p>  Informed by the public consultation and a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill has commenced and I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of Heads of a Bill in Quarter 4 of 2021. The Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we will also continue to provide up to date advice, guidance and information on all aspects of remote working for workers and employers.</p></reply>

Whilst the revised NDP sets out the key physical infrastructure projects in transport, health, broadband and energy that will serve our society into the future, the Department&rsquo;s NDP projects and programmes complement these by prioritising knowledge capital and investment in the enterprise environment that enhance competitiveness, job creation and the productivity and innovative capacity of our businesses. A competitive, innovative and resilient enterprise base is essential to achieve the ambitions set out in Project Ireland 2040, delivering employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions. </p><p>The programmes to be delivered by Enterprise Ireland include the Green Transition Fund (driving decarbonisation and enterprise resilience in the transition to a low carbon economy), the Digital Transition Fund (building a future focused SME base), Seed and Venture Capital Funding (assisting regional start-ups and growth), the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (spurring innovation and investment in cutting-edge technologies and future-focused solutions), the Space Technologies Programme (benefitting firms in the regions) and EI will establish the network of European Digital Innovation Hubs.  These actions will be undertaken in line with EI&rsquo;s new corporate strategy.</p><p>IDA Ireland will continue to strengthen growth and employment potential with a particular focus on balanced regional development and smart specialisation, building competitive and innovative regions and enterprises. Its projects will include the expansion of the National Institute for Bioprocess Researching and Training (NIBRT), the commencement of the Advanced Manufacturing Centre, and the continued roll-out of the Regional Property Programme.</p><p>The Advanced Manufacturing Centre is a new, independent industry-led centre that will enable Irish based discrete manufacturers (MNCs and SMEs) access, adopt, and accelerate digital technologies at scale, which solve real world challenges and drive further competitiveness. The AMC building is currently under construction at the National Technology Park, Limerick. It is expected that the AMC building will be practically complete in Q4 2021, with the centre fully operational in Q1 2022.</p><p>The expansion of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) will be rolled out and capacity will be scaled up to produce personalised medicines. It is expected that contractors will be appointed in November 2021 and that construction will commence in Q4 2021. The expansion is due for completion in Q4 2022.</p><p>The IDA Regional Property Programme will be expanded in order to continue to attract investment to regional locations. Over the course of the current strategy to 2024, IDA will see the delivery of 19 buildings across 15 regional locations together with land acquisitions, infrastructure, and services delivery. </p><p>Five properties are currently under construction, with three due to be completed in Q4 2021. These include Advanced Building Solution in Sligo; Advanced Technology Building in Monaghan; and the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Limerick. </p><p>Four further buildings are at contractor procurement stage, with two in Limerick and Athlone due to commence onsite in Q4. </p><p>A further three are awaiting planning approval; these include Advanced Buildings Solutions in Sligo, Cavan, and Galway. </p><p>Nine further projects are at earlier stages of development.

Therefore, appropriate examination of all implications and consultation with stakeholders is essential to the development of the scheme. We do not want to jeopardise jobs by placing a cost and/or admin burden on business without working through all of the implications and potential solutions. This is why my Department undertook a full public consultation, reviewed international best practice, and formed an interdepartmental group &ndash; to ensure that all views and issues were properly considered in the development of the scheme.  </p><p>Department officials are currently finalising the draft Heads of Bill in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I will then seek Cabinet approval to publish the Bill over the coming weeks. It will also be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny which is to be carried out by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, following which the Bill will need to pass through both houses of the Oireachtas. </p><p>It is important that we continue to prioritise the completion of all steps  required to get this Bill through the legislative process.  We will then be in a position to communicate clear instructions on the detail of requirements for end-users.</p><p>Officials from my Department are very mindful of the important role played by the Payroll Software Developers and appreciate their offer to assist with the development of detailed guidelines and worked examples.

The EU with its Member States has been the leading donor to the COVAX facility with &euro;3.2 billion committed to support equitable distribution of vaccines. Team Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p><p>The global production of vaccines is increasing rapidly and it is estimated that 12 billion doses of COVID vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021. The EU has been the leading exporter of vaccines, exporting over 730 million doses, around half of its vaccine production, to more than 130 countries by mid-September 2021.</p><p>Reports from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) suggest that by January 2022, there will be sufficient vaccines produced for every adult on every continent.</p><p>Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are served by our collective effort.  As a member of the global health community, Ireland continues to play an active role in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines for all. This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p></reply>

A balance exists between an employer&rsquo;s legal obligation to protect the health of their employees and maintain a safe place of work and an employee's right around privacy of their medical information. Fundamentally, the decision to get a vaccination against COVID-19 is voluntary and there are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory.</p><p>However, with the high levels of vaccination uptake in Ireland, the majority of the adult population in Ireland are fully vaccinated. This can only offer re-assurance to both employers and employees who are returning to the physical workplace. </p><p>Notwithstanding these high levels of vaccination, current public health advice is that all existing COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures must be adhered to whether workers are vaccinated or unvaccinated. Therefore, the control measures set out in the Work Safely Protocol will remain the key focus for employers, business managers and employees.</p><p>The Government is also calling on employers, in consultation with their workers, to develop longer-term arrangements for blended or remote working having regard to their operational requirements. In this regard, my Department published, earlier this year, the &ldquo;Making Remote Work &ndash; National Remote Working Strategy&rdquo; which outlines the vision for the future of remote working in Ireland.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 October over 257,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed and over 108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas. The first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.  Surveys are complete or underway in County Cavan in Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles,Caughoo, Belturbet, Killashandra, Butler&rsquo;s Bridge, Ballylennon, Redhills, Gannons Cross, Derryheelan, Castlesaunderson, Townparks, Foalies Bridge, Riverrun and Erne Hill. Main works commenced outside Cavan town including Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles, and in Caughoo in the South of the county.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cavan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p><p>Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 1 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Cornafean Community Centre, Mullahoran Community Centre, Drumavaddy Community Centre, Glengevlin Community Hall, Templeport Community Centre, Gallonray House, Gallonreagh, Maudabawn, Killenkere Leisure Centre, Kildallan Parish Hall, Castle Saunderson Scout Centre, Castlerahan Community Centre and Bunnoe Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Killoughter National School, Corlis National School, Kilmore National School, Lackan National School, Dromaili  National School, Saint Patrick's School, Kildallan National School, Greaghrahan National School, Laragh National School and Corlea National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>.</p></reply>

Our offshore wind target of 5GW by 2030 requires private investment of tens of billions of euros and the NDP outlines our approach to unlock this  private investment, including an enhanced regulatory regime, specific offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) auctions and a second Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan. My Department is developing the first of a series of RESS auctions specific to offshore wind, the terms and conditions of which will be published shortly. </p><p>Regular RESS onshore auctions will also deliver competitive levels of up to 8GW of onshore wind and up to 2.5GW of solar electricity generation by 2030. The second RESS auction, RESS 2, is planned to be held next year. My officials are working to finalise the auction design and my aim is to accelerate the current auction timetable and deliver a second onshore RESS auction. </p><p>Under NSO 3 - Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities - the commitment to the National Broadband Plan (NBP) is underpinned with an investment of &euro;2.7 billion that will bring high-speed broadband to every home, school, and business in Ireland, within the Intervention Area. This project is advancing, with over 257,000 premises across all counties surveyed and over 108,000 premises under construction. In addition, primary schools with no high-speed broadband have been prioritised, an acceleration which will see 679 primary schools connected to high-speed broadband by the end of 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. 379 Broadband Connection Points have also been installed by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.</p><p>Finally, the wider NDP investment will underpin the transition to a Circular Economy and support initiatives such as the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme to be introduced in 2022, creating a cleaner, healthier environment and a more sustainable society.</p></reply>

These schemes provide free energy upgrades for households in, or at risk of, energy poverty as well as partial grants for those that can contribute to the cost. Full details on the application processes for the range of schemes operated by the SEAI are available at www.seai.ie.</p>  <p>  A new National Home Retrofit Scheme will be launched at the end of this year. The Scheme will support homeowners to achieve deeper (B2) retrofits with heat pumps and will facilitate continuous, year-round working and the multi-year planning which has long been identified as a crucial requirement by the supply chain and homeowners. Information on this scheme will be published at its launch.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is responsible for the local authority retrofit programme.  The &ldquo;Housing for All&rdquo; plan commits to the retrofitting of 36,500 local authority homes by 2030 which will contribute to the achievement of our overall retrofit target.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. The position in relation to home previously upgraded under SEAI schemes is set out below: </p><p>-  Under the Community Energy Grant Scheme and the National Home Retrofit (One Stop Shop Development) Scheme, grants may be claimed for additional measures to increase the energy efficiency of a home as part of an overall project to achieve a specified target. For example, external wall insulation can be supported in homes that previously received cavity wall insulation where it is determined that it is an appropriate intervention as part of an overall upgrade project to attain B2 or cost optimal and meet the minimum BER uplift.  </p> <blockquote> 	-  The Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income homeowners vulnerable to energy poverty.  There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised and published shortly.<br /><br />-  The Better Energy Homes scheme aims to improve energy efficiency by providing grant support for energy efficiency upgrades to homeowners whose homes were built and occupied prior to 2006 for insulation and heating control systems and 2011 for heat pump and solar thermal grants. Under the scheme a home cannot receive grant funding twice for the same energy efficiency measure.<br /><br />It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. The grant schemes provided by SEAI are however reviewed on a regular basis.  </blockquote></reply>

The first National Implementation Plan 2018-2020, published in 2018, was developed to oversee and facilitate coherent implementation of the SDGs across Government, and to promote awareness of the SDGs.  A renewed focus is currently being given to progress Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Substantial progress has been achieved in recent months in respect of reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of Agenda 2030 and identifying key priorities and actions for inclusion in the next National Implementation Plan.  It is intended that the draft Plan will be made available shortly and form the basis of discussion at the next SDG National Stakeholder Forum. This will allow for a final round of input from stakeholders prior to finalisation and publication.</p>  <p>  A fundamental feature of the 2030 Agenda is the inclusive and active voice stakeholders had in both the negotiation and adoption of the Agenda. Achieving sustainable development, and particularly the targets and commitments set out in the 17 SDGs, will require not only action by government but all individuals across society. In this regard, I recently launched a public consultation to review the performance of the previous Plan. Launched on the 16 July, the consultation was open for an 8-week period, seeking views from members of the public, industry and interested stakeholders. Submissions are currently being reviewed and will directly inform the design and structure of the next iteration of the Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

The increase in 2022 will be &euro;7.50 bringing the overall rate to &euro;41 per tonne. The increase will apply from 13 October 2021 for diesel and petrol and from 1 May 2022 for all other fuels to allow for the winter heating season.   A predictable schedule of carbon tax increases, in conjunction with other measures such as investment in active mobility and energy efficiency measures, and a progressive replacement of the private car fleet to electric vehicles, will allow households and businesses to plan for increases in carbon tax and, over time, this will change consumption and investment decisions.</p>  <p>  Research commissioned by my Department and published by the ESRI in 2019 has analysed the effects of increasing carbon taxes on the use of fossil fuels. The report, "The economic and distributional impacts of an increased carbon tax with different revenue recycling schemes,&rdquo; published on 8 October 2019, found that an incremental increase in the carbon tax reaching &euro;80 per tonne in 2030, would help reduce economy-wide emissions by approximately 15% in 2030, compared to no increase in the carbon tax.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, over the period 2021 &ndash; 2030 the planned carbon tax increases may allow for &euro;9.5 billion in additional revenue. &euro;5 billion of the expected &euro;9.5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts will be invested in energy efficiency, including underpinning the forthcoming National Retrofit Plan which will be an integral part of the Climate Action Plan that will be published in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  &euro;1.5 billion of additional current funding will be made available over 2021 &ndash; 2030 for new schemes that will assist farmers in the decarbonisation of the agricultural sector and this will be detailed in the Government&rsquo;s implementation programme for the new Common Agricultural Policy 2023 &ndash; 2027, which will be published later this year and will take effect from 2023 onwards.</p>  <p>  The remaining &euro;3 billion in funding will be explicitly used to ensure that increases in the carbon tax are progressive by tackling fuel poverty and providing for a just transition, with ESRI research, published in advance of Budget 2021, demonstrating that recycling just one third of the revenue raised from the carbon tax increases leaves the lowest income fifth of households on average better off, and reduces poverty. Adjustments to relevant social welfare schemes in the context of Budget 2022 will be announced by the Minister for Social Protection.  </p></reply>

I am committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge through enhanced regulation of all solid fuels. New emissions standards are being introduced to ensure that the most polluting fuels will no longer be available for sale on the Irish market.  Introducing these standards will improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.   The contribution of peat to fine particulate matter levels can be considerable, particularly in areas such as the Midlands where peat extraction occurs. There is also increasing evidence which indicates that sod peat is being traded through the &lsquo;grey market&rsquo;, and is being used in more urbanised settings where it has an even greater impact on air quality than in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In order to accommodate those with turbary rights to continue to cut and burn sod peat for their own domestic purposes, but which will lead to a reduction in the use of sod peat more generally, a distinct regulatory approach to this fuel is required. Measures under consideration include the introduction of standards, emission limits or restrictions on the marketing, sale or distribution of peat in urban areas. When determined, the required measures will form part of the new solid fuel regulatory system which I intend to introduce from September 2022. </p></reply>

These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.Under the Better Energy Homes scheme, a grant of &euro;1,200 is available for Solar Water Heating installation. The installation must meet the minimum annual solar renewable energy contribution based on the floor area of the dwelling. Full details of the technical criteria can be found in the Domestic Technical Standards and Specification (DTSS) publication available on the SEAI website. </p><p>All solar products installed must be included on the SEAI Solar Thermal Registered Product List. If a manufacturer or their designated agent wishes to register a product on the SEAI Solar Thermal Registered Product List, they must complete and return a Solar Thermal Product Registration form along with any supporting documentation. This form can be downloaded from the SEAI website at www.seai.ie/grants/supports-for-contractors/  . The product will be assessed by SEAI to ensure compliance with thermal performance and durability criteria and if successful, will be included on the registered product list.  I have been advised that SEAI have no record of any recent applications made to their Solar Thermal Registered Product List. If the company referred to by the Deputy made an application to the SEAI they can contact them directly on 01 8082004 or 1850 927 000. </p><p>Should a homeowner wish to apply for the Solar Thermal Grant they can visit <i>www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/solar-water-heating-grant/</i>for further details.

The move to upgraded digital meters will bring many benefits for energy customers by enhancing competition, making bills more accurate, providing customers with better information on their energy consumption and empowering them with new tools to make more informed choices about their energy needs.  Accurate energy usage information across the day will enable consumers to be more efficient in their use of electricity and save money, for example by using appliances off peak. This will, in turn, reduce the need for less efficient and more costly generation at peak times.  </p>  <p>  The programme is being coordinated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities with ESB Networks responsible for rolling out smart-ready electricity meters. This rollout commenced in September 2019 and is due to conclude by end 2024 when some 2.25 million electricity meters will have been replaced in our homes and businesses nationwide. To date, almost 500,000 meters have been installed, in spite of the challenges caused by Covid-19 restrictions during 2020-2021.</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published early next year.</p><p>Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  </p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. </p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging.  </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</i></p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme in the coming months to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p><p>My Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

The transport sector currently accounts for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions levels and a reduction in emissions levels in the sector, through a combination of taxation and incentivisation, will form a key part of achieving that target.  Private car usage represents 50% of those emissions.  In this regard, the CO2 based motor tax system for private cars, which comprise the bulk of the vehicle fleet, is structured in such a way as to incentivise the uptake of electric and lower CO2-emitting vehicles, with these attracting lower motor tax rates than higher emitting vehicles.  </p>  <p>There were changes to the motor tax system in Budget 2021 to provide for the transition to a new vehicle emissions test procedure, the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) for vehicles registered in the State on or after 1 January 2021.  Cars in the existing CO2 fleet continue to be taxed on the same banding structure that has been in effect since 1 January 2013, while there were some modest increases to rates in the higher emitting Bands C to G, the first increases in motor tax since that date.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published National Development Plan, the Government is committed to strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility, with a range of investments proposed in new and existing public transport infrastructure.  The Plan commits to significant investment in the land transport network and the upcoming National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland will set out the priorities for investment in the land transport network. </p>  <p>  The Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, Our Rural Future, also contains over 150 commitments to the improvement of the quality of life in rural Ireland, to be delivered by central Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  These include commitments to providing improved rural transport services, piloting new transport initiatives to enhance the quality of life for people in rural areas, and  ensuring that public transport services in rural and regional areas are accessible to those with disabilities or reduced mobility.  The Policy aims to develop expanded Local Link Services and to further integrate Local Link Services with other existing public transport services through the rollout of the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland Plan.  There is also a commitment to develop a grant-aided Community Transport Service Scheme through Local Link, as well as to running a pilot to examine the potential for hail-riding services to improve rural connectivity and to develop a subsidised Local Area Hackney Scheme in designated areas that are too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney service.  The Policy also commits to investing in high quality walking and cycling infrastructure specifically targeted at towns and villages across the country, investing in the local and regional road network to maintain roads to a proper standard and to increase regional connectivity and to increasing investment in the repair of non-public roads through the Local Improvement Scheme.</p></reply>

When evaluating the progression of these projects, a prioritisation will be undertaken which will be in line with the 2:1 Programme for Government commitment on new public transport and new roads, the &quot;NIFTI&quot; framework, the National Planning Framework and the requirements of the Climate Action Plan. It will also take account of available funding levels in any given year, as well as a focus, where appropriate, on town bypasses which facilitate compact growth.</p><p>A proposed bypass of Tipperary town will be considered in the coming months in this context, informed in part by the budget and agreed funding levels for 2022 - which are not yet decided. </p><p>The latest information on the status of the N24 project, including the Tipperary town bypass, is available to TII.

I would encourage any individual who has the requisite skills, male or female, to put themselves forward for these open competitions, which provide genuine opportunities to contribute.</p><p>There are 11 commercial bodies and 5 non-commercial bodies under the aegis of the Department of Transport.In addition, my Department also processes board appointments for 2 organisations under the remit of our agencies, namely the Railway Safety Advisory Council and the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles.</p><p>Information in relation to the membership, number and percentage of women on each board is summarised in the following table.  <table>    <tr>       <th>State Board/Agency</th>       <th>Total Board membership</th>       <th>Total current Board Members</th>       <th>Number of Females on current Board</th>       <th>Female as % of total currently on Board</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>29%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>33%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bus &Eacute;ireann</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>29%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>33%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Port Company</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>50%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Aviation Authority</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>50%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Marine Casualty Investigation Board</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>67%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Bureau of Road Safety</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>40%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Transport Authority</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>22%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Port of Cork Company</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>29%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Port of Waterford Company</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Railway Safety Advisory Council</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>43%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Road Safety Authority</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>56%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shannon Foynes Port Company</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>43%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shannon Group PLC</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>25%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Transport Infrastructure Ireland</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>27%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>daa plc</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Information relating to board appointments for agencies under my Department's remit and the basis of that appointment is available here on stateboards.ie and on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The scheduling of appointments is an operational matter for the Road Safety Authority, and one in which I have no role.</p>  <p>  I am therefore passing this part of the Deputy's question to the Road Safety Authority for direct reply.  If a reply has not been received within 10 working days, the Deputy should contact my office. </p>  <p>  Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the initial pandemic response, along with the health protocols required since the resumption of services, services are operating below normal capacity and a significant backlog has developed.</p>  <p>  In line with the gradual reopening of services this summer, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have now recommenced. Critical frontline workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing service. </p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests. An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July.</p>  <p>  In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort. </p>  <p>  A further issue is the number of tests carried out per tester per day.  Before the pandemic, testers conducted eight tests per day. On the resumption of the service in summer 2020, this was reduced to five because of health precautions, but later raised to six. As of September 27, 2021, this has been further increased to seven tests per tester per day. </p>  <p>  The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority. As a result, it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

This includes remuneration restrictions. The same applies to statements made by officials of other banks and of the banking sector representative body, the BPFI.</p>  <p>  In the past, I have answered a parliamentary question for the Deputy in relation to remuneration restrictions at the banks. The position has not changed in the meantime and for the benefit of the Deputy, I am providing my previous response as follows:</p>  <p>  Government policy on banking remuneration has remained unchanged since the financial crisis. Extensive restrictions are in place and these are not simply confined to a small number of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap. These affect circa 23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks. </p>  <p>  As a result the previous Government undertook to carry out a review of Government bank remuneration policy to determine if it remained fit for purpose. My department worked with the specialist advisory division of Korn Ferry to undertake this review. Stakeholders engaged with included the major institutional investors in the banks, proxy advisory firms, the Financial Services Union (FSU), the chairs of the remuneration committee in each of the banks, the Central Bank of Ireland and representatives of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously I have read the report. It is a complex and far ranging piece of work and it has most certainly informed my thinking on the issue.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there is a very different European regulatory environment in place now which will help prevent the return to some of the excesses of the boom years including the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Remuneration Guidelines of the European Banking Authority.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the powers of the Central Bank were significantly enhanced by the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, particularly powers to take action against wrongdoing by financial services providers and to strengthen the ability of the Central Bank to take action against individuals.</p>  <p>  However I believe the issue of bank remuneration is inextricably linked to further restoring public confidence in the culture and accountability of our banks and the forthcoming SEAR regime and the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill more generally, will provide an effective framework and will help to reassure the public that meaningful cultural change is underway in the banking sector. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific businesses or individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive framework.</p><p>However, Government understands the importance of businesses being able to access affordable insurance, and is working to improve the cost and availability of this vital financial service through 66 cross-departmental actions under the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. This work is being prioritised by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment<i>. </i>The Sub-Group meets regularly to review the implementation of this reform agenda, which is progressing well, with 34 of the 66 actions now complete. Later this month, we will be meeting to discuss how to progress the remaining reforms in a timely manner. </p><p>I note that the details supplied mention the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU in relation to the capacity issues currently being experienced by some businesses when seeking public liability cover. Although exacerbated by Brexit, I understand that a more prominent reason for the market withdrawal of some international insurers in recent years has been instability in the personal injury claims environment. I believe the new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>, a key reform which has been delivered several months ahead of schedule, should help to reduce uncertainty for claimants and insurers, and encourage greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) in claims settlement. Given that they have also cut award levels for many injuries, use of the Guidelines should reduce the overall cost of claims. I expect insurers to reflect these savings by lowering premiums for customers, including businesses. Government will hold the industry to account in this regard. I also believe insurers should now extend their risk appetite to provide insurance in sectors experiencing capacity issues, such as tourism, given the stability afforded by the Guidelines.  </p><p>Upcoming Action Plan priorities also aim to ease the insurance burden for businesses in particular. These include legislative proposals to reform the law on Occupiers&rsquo; Liability and the Duty of Care, which are expected to be brought to Government for approval shortly. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also working to bring forward legislation to enhance the role of the PIAB, which should lead to an increased number of claims being settled more cost-effectively. Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to work with colleagues to drive forward these reforms with a view to improving the insurance environment for both existing businesses and start-up firms, which are vital to the post-pandemic recovery.</p></reply>

This includes approximately 200,000 paper LPT Returns to property owners who have not previously availed of the online options.</p>  <p>  Property owners who have not received a hard-copy LPT Return and are not able to file online should not be concerned and should contact the LPT Helpline on (01) 7383626 for assistance. Revenue&rsquo;s call centre agents will help with the Return filing process and will set up the property owner&rsquo;s preferred payment method. In advance of calling the Helpline, property owners will need to have determined the market value of their property so that the Return can be completed. They should also have their Property ID and PIN to hand, which can be found on any LPT correspondence previously received from Revenue.  </p>  <p>  When determining the market value of a property for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;, it is not necessary for property owners to use online sources for guidance if it is difficult for them to do so. Non-online sources such as the property pages in newspapers (local and/or national) or checking the information displayed in local auctioneer offices are alternative sources that can provide useful guidance to assist in determining the correct &lsquo;valuation band&rsquo; to be applied.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific property referenced by the Deputy, Revenue has confirmed that it will make direct contact with the person in question and provide any assistance required. </p></reply>

In considering the most appropriate time to reopen offices, Revenue will continue to focus on customer and staff safety as its highest priority and, as was the case for most of its public offices before the pandemic, will re-open on an appointment only basis where all such meetings will fully observe the necessary social distancing protocols.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has continued to provide a full range of online services for taxpayers to manage their tax affairs, which for the most part remove any requirement to access public offices. These services, which include an online communications channel through the <i>MyEnquiries</i>system, are available 24/7, are easy to use and are fully secure.</p><p>For taxpayers who, for a variety of reasons, may not have access to the online services, Revenue is providing extensive support across its various telephone helplines and is operating a full service for queries being received through the postal system. Further details regarding the different telephone helplines is available on the Revenue website under &quot;contact details&quot;, which may be of assistance to the Deputy. For the more complex matters that require one to one engagement, taxpayers can avail of virtual appointments with the relevant Revenue official through video-conferencing facilities. </p><p>Regarding income tax return filing, Revenue has advised me that mandatory electronic filing (e-filing) continues to be a requirement for most self-assessed taxpayers. The only exception is where a taxpayer is not e-enabled due to issues such as insufficient internet access, age related difficulties or physical/mental disability. Further information on mandatory e-filing, including the type of exclusions available is set out on the Revenue website (via &quot;starting and running a business&quot;).  </p><p>Finally, if the Deputy is aware of a specific taxpayer that requires assistance, he should provide the details through the Oireachtas Helpline and Revenue will make direct contact. </p></reply>

Having considered the possible inequities and administrative challenges of such an exemption or waiver structure the group recommended instead a deferral scheme that would assist property owners in a number of different scenarios including low income. The interdepartmental group recommended that where taxpayers are entitled to, and have elected for, deferral of LPT, interest due on deferred payments should be at a lower rate to the rate charged on overdue LPT which is 8% per annum. The Government accepted these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax if certain conditions are met. Any LPT that is deferred between 2013 and 2021 carries an interest charge of 4% per annum.  Interest will accrue on the deferred amount until such time that it is paid off. In providing for the possibility of deferral of the tax, the reduced rate of interest recognises that the circumstances in which a person defers the tax charge are very different from those where the property owner simply fails to pay the tax.  </p>  <p>  A review of the interest rate on deferred LPT took place this year, in advance of the next LPT valuation period (i.e. 2022 to 2025).   The review took account of the Covid initiative on the warehousing of tax debts, in respect of which a reduced interest rate of 3% applies for late payment of outstanding liabilities.  In the interests of consistency and fairness, the Government decided to  reduce the LPT deferral rate to 3%.  The 3% rate will apply to any LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022.  It will also apply to any LPT that was deferred between 2013 and 2021, to the extent that it is still outstanding in 2022.  The recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 also provides that for 2022 the deferral income thresholds will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner (from &euro;15,000) and &euro;30,000 for a couple (from &euro;25,000).  </p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral there are a wide number of phased payment options available to assist with budgeting. The various options are designed to provide the maximum possible flexibility for individual circumstances. Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has engaged extensively with individual taxpayers experiencing financial difficulties due to the pandemic to agree flexible arrangements that best suit their circumstances, including in respect of LPT liabilities and will continue to fully engage with taxpayers facing tax payment difficulties.</p></reply>

In the Finance Act 2016 the Levy was extended until 2021. That extension had been subject to a review being undertaken of the methodology used to calculate the levy, which included a public consultation with stakeholders in June 2016. That stakeholder exercise was inconclusive in terms of getting external agreement on a possible replacement to the DIRT-based methodology. </p>  <p>  Ultimately the DIRT-based formula was retained but the then Minister for Finance took into account the suggestion that arose from the Public Consultation that the base year for calculating Levy liability should not be static, and announced in Budget 2017 the introduction of a rolling two-year series of base years. </p>  <p>  In order to protect the annual &euro;150 million yield based on the financial institutions' DIRT liability, the rate payable has increased from 35% in 2014 to 308% for 2021.   </p>  <p>  The Bank Levy is due to cease in 2021. I am currently considering whether to extend the levy beyond 2021, and if so the format it will take. In making my decision on this matter, the Deputy should note that I will be giving consideration to the significant changes taking place in the Irish banking sector, including the planned withdrawal of two retail banks from the market.</p></reply>

The scheme applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, certain self-assessed income tax amounts and overpayments of both the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). To qualify for debt warehousing, a business must continue to file all tax returns, even though the liability cannot be paid.</p>  <p>  For eligible businesses, Period 1, the period during which tax debts may be warehoused, has been extended to 31st December 2021, and tax debts can then be &lsquo;parked&rsquo; interest-free until 31st December 2022.  At that point, the warehoused debt may be paid in full without incurring an interest charge or can be paid through a tailored phased payment arrangement starting in 2023 at a significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum. This compares to the standard rate of 8% or 10% per annum that would otherwise apply to such debts.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the total amount of debt warehoused at the end of September 2021 was &euro;2.7 billion in respect of over 93,000 businesses. At the end of 2022, Revenue will engage with all businesses availing of the scheme to agree a suitable phased payment arrangement in respect of the &lsquo;parked&rsquo; liability. These arrangements will be flexible and will be extended to suit individual financial circumstances, providing current taxes are paid as they fall due. Revenue has not estimated the potential amount of warehoused debt that will not be paid as the expectation at this point is that flexible payment arrangements will assist businesses in meeting their obligations over time.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the value of the debt warehoused is not included in the published tax receipts for 2021 as the debt has been &lsquo;parked&rsquo;, therefore it has not been collected.  Where businesses opt to make an early payment of these debts in 2021, this figure will be included in the published tax receipts.

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.   Another main aim of the policy underpinning the design of scheme is to help encourage the building of additional new properties.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question about extending the scheme to second-hand properties, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.  A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief might not improve its effectiveness; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.  I can confirm, therefore, that I have no plans at present in this regard. </p></reply>

SFCT is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and liability to the tax arises on the first supply of solid fuel in the State. The rates of SFCT are set out in Finance Act 2010 and the Deputy will be aware that I brought forward amendments in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a ten year trajectory of SFCT increases as part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to meet climate action objectives. SFCT applies at different rates to four categories of solid fuel including coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat. The SFCT rate on coal, currently &euro;88.23 per tonne, applies to all types of smokeless and &ldquo;smoky&rdquo; coal. </p>  <p>  Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union there can be no restrictions placed on the movement of goods such as coal into the State from other Member States including Northern Ireland. No Revenue offence arises where coal or other solid fuels are brought into the State or placed on the market here. As already outlined, Revenue&rsquo;s role is to ensure compliance with SFCT law including ensuring that solid fuel suppliers making first supplies in the State are registered for SFCT and file returns and payments on a bi-monthly basis in arrears. Revenue enforces SFCT law using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.</p>  <p>  Separate to taxation matters, there are also laws setting out national standards for solid fuel;  those laws comes under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication and the enforcement of such standards for solid fuel is a statutory function of Local Authorities operating under that legislation.  They are not matters in which Revenue has a role.  I understand that Local Authorities currently have extensive powers to support enforcement of the existing smoky coal ban including powers to:</p>  <p>  - Undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as to collect samples,</p>  <p>  - Bring a prosecution under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations,</p>  <p>  - Issue a Fixed Payment Notice (or &lsquo;on the spot fine&rsquo;) for alleged offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of prohibited fuels in Low Smoke Zones, with a penalty range of &euro;250 to &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has referred to Ireland&rsquo;s new emission standards that will be introduced across the State in advance of the 2022 heating season, as part of the national laws on solid fuel standards. When announcing the introduction of these new standards my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications indicated that a framework for legislation has been developed and drafting of new regulations would be finalised in the coming months.  The Deputy may wish to refer his query on plans to deal with the sale and supply of domestic solid fuels that do not comply with Ireland&rsquo;s new emission standards to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may know, the current medical criteria medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.

Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review.

Cars in the existing CO<sub>2</sub>fleet continue to be taxed on the same banding structure that has been in effect since 1 January 2013, while there were some modest increases to rates in the higher emitting Bands C to G, the first increases in motor tax since that date.  Pre-2008 cars are still taxed according to engine size, and those rates were not changed in Budget 2021. The old, discredited New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) motor tax table was adjusted to reflect climate action priorities and to ensure a level playing field with the introduction of a third table that covers WLTP cars registered from 1/1/2021.</p><p>The Programme for Government 2020 contains a commitment to an average of a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions year-on-year from 2021 to 2030 and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.The transport sector currently accounts for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions levels and a reduction in emissions levels in the sector, through a combination of taxation and incentivisation, will form a key part of achieving that target.Private car usage represents 50% of those emissions.In this regard, the CO<sub>2</sub>based motor tax system for private cars, which comprise the bulk of the vehicle fleet, is structured in such a way as to incentivise the uptake of electric and lower CO<sub>2</sub>-emitting vehicles, with these attracting lower motor tax rates than higher emitting vehicles.</p></reply>

The Directive defines and classifies various manufactured tobacco products according to their characteristics and lays down the relevant minimum rates of excise duty for the different types of products. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and a high level of health protection.</p><p>Every four years, the European Commission is required to submit a report to the Council on the rates and the structure of excise duties, accompanied &ndash; where appropriate &ndash; by a proposal for the revision of the Directive. The latest report was prepared by the Commission on 10 February 2020 and on 2 June 2020 the Council approved conclusions setting out its priorities in relation to the review of the Directive. A public consultation, open between 30 March 2021 and 22 June 2021, sought to ensure that all relevant stakeholders had an opportunity to express their views on the current rules and on possible changes to these rules. The Commission is expected to bring forward a new legislative proposal later this year or early in 2022 and the impact of this can be assessed when the proposal is available. </p><p>The Commission Report and the Council conclude that it is necessary to upgrade the EU regulatory framework, in order to tackle current and future challenges in respect of the functioning of the internal market by harmonising definitions and tax treatment of novel products (such as liquids for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products), including products that substitute tobacco, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and regulatory disparities in the EU. Revision can also address the issue of tax-induced substitution across products and enable further measures to combat the illicit trade in tobacco to address tax control, revenue collection and health protection issues.</p><p>Ireland welcomes the review of the Directive to ensure that the rules remain fit for purpose, safeguard the proper functioning of the internal market and, very importantly, provide for a high level of health protection. This latter point is particularly significant in the context of the <i>European Action Plan against Cancer</i>and our own national policy, <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, both of which recognise that taxation plays a pivotal role in reducing tobacco consumption, in particular in deterring youth from smoking.</p><p>Ireland is committed to a policy of high taxation of tobacco to encourage people to quit smoking. As of October 2021, the cost of a pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category stands at &euro;14.50 and a typical 30 gram pack of RYO tobacco is around &euro;20.50.</p><p>Budget practice is to decide on a defined tax increase (inclusive of VAT) on a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, with <i>pro rata</i>increases on the other tobacco products.  Cognisant that the relatively lower cost of roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco products can incentivise their use, and therefore seeking to progressively reduce that price differential, additional excise increases in respect of RYO were included in the 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018 Finance Acts. </p><p>In addition to seeking to narrow the price gap between RYO and cigarettes, by way of additional excise increases on RYO, Government health and social policy has focused on the further denormalisation of smoking generally as consumption of tobacco products remains one of the greatest avoidable and preventable health risks in our society.  Similar considerations arise in respect of heated tobacco products and other alternative products. While heated tobacco products are not currently available on the Irish market, I am informed by Revenue that, in the event that they are introduced, the current national tobacco tax provisions are sufficiently broad to ensure that they will fall to be taxed as smoking tobacco.</p><p>Of course, one consequence for a country such as ours with a high taxation policy approach to tobacco, is that this increases the likelihood of smuggling and illicit activity.Revenue is very conscious of the threat that tobacco smuggling poses to health, to legitimate business interests, and to the Exchequer, and Revenue continues to make tackling the problem a priority.</p><p>It is also the case that tobacco products can be legally brought into the country legitimately:  whether duty-paid from other EU states, or as duty-free from a third country.  In this regard and in parallel with the revision of Council Directive 2011/64/EU, we welcome the fact that the Commission has commissioned a study to assess Articles 32 and 36 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty. The study is focussing on the cross-border acquisition of excise products by private individuals and cross-border distance selling, and the study should help inform this aspect of tobacco policy into the future. </p></reply>

The total funding applied for under the scheme significantly exceeded the amount available to allocate and it was not possible to allocate grants to many worthy projects.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered. It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

My priorities for the budget, beyond securing funding for a pilot Basic Income Guarantee Scheme for artists, is to secure funding to support the full recovery of the arts/culture and live entertainment sectors in 2022. The Government understands that the full return of live performance will not happen overnight. I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. </p><p>In relation to the Basic Income Guarantee pilot, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce report <i>Life Worth Living</i>, was published in November 2020 and made ten recommendations for the sector. I believe the delivery of this pilot will be key to underpinning the recovery in the arts and culture sector and will provide much needed certainty to the artists and creatives who choose to avail of the pilot scheme.</p><p>I was delighted that as part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector.</p><p>I established an Oversight Group to appraise the recommendations in the <i>Life Worth Living </i>report and asked that they prioritise the examination of the Recommendation on a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. The Oversight Group has provided me with a preliminary report on the different options for a 3 year pilot scheme which I am currently considering.  </p><p>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that funding of &euro;25m for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme for artists was announced today in the context of Budget 2022. Now further stakeholder engagement will take place between my Department and those in the Sector to ensure that this pilot meets the needs of the sector alongside the objectives agreed by the Oversight Group. </p><p>I envision that this pilot should launch in early 2022 and I believe it will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector, after the difficult circumstances they have endured over the last year and a half.</p></reply>

The structure is not in the ownership or care of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and is therefore not managed or maintained by the OPW. This is the case with much of our archaeological heritage, including castles of various classifications, most of which are in private ownership and we are grateful to all owners for their custodianship of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage. Should a private owner of any monument wish to carry out work to conserve a monument or to provide on-site interpretation material, they would be advised to consult with Local Authority Heritage officials regarding funding possibilities under various heritage grant schemes, including the Community Monuments Fund. It should be noted that all owners are required to comply with the National Monuments Acts. </p><p>The Community Monuments Fund is an initiative of my Department, which since 2020 has provided over 5.3 million euro to owners and custodians of archaeological monuments to safeguard them into the future for the benefit of local communities and the visiting public<b>.</b>Over 200 monuments including castles have benefited from the scheme since late 2020. The core aims of the Fund are the conservation, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites. Our archaeological heritage spans 8000 years of settlement on this island, with over 150,000 known sites and monuments. The condition of heritage sites vary significantly, and my Department&rsquo;s grant schemes are aimed at supporting owners and communities in the care of  the sites in their stewardship.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases. </p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p><p>The table below shows the number of active HAP tenancies at the end of Q2 2021, by local authority: <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Active HAP tenancies at end Q2 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow  County Council</td>       <td>723</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council</td>       <td>462</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council</td>       <td>1,420</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council</td>       <td>3,211</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council</td>       <td>3,773</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal   County Council</td>       <td>1,828</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>5,294</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown   County Council</td>       <td>841</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council</td>       <td>2,429</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council</td>       <td>1,994</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council</td>       <td>1,491</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council</td>       <td>1,693</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council</td>       <td>2,383</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>826</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council</td>       <td>968</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council</td>       <td>308</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County   Council</td>       <td>2,502</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford County Council</td>       <td>382</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council</td>       <td>3,322</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council</td>       <td>1,376</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council</td>       <td>2,265</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council</td>       <td>582</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly County Council</td>       <td>844</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council</td>       <td>472</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council</td>       <td>851</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council</td>       <td>2,983</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>       <td>1,882</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County   Council</td>       <td>2,139</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council</td>       <td>1,008</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>1,577</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>1,710</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Regional   Homeless Executive (DRHE)*</td>       <td>8,558</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>62,097</td>    </tr> </table> *DRHE is operating Homeless HAP on behalf of the four Dublin Local Authorities</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and associated services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</p><p>While responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation services rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis. A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Decisions on the range of emergency accommodation and funding required in each region are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum.</p><p>My Department does not fund homeless services directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards these costs. Under these arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources.  Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of these funding arrangements with my Department. Therefore, the exact spend by housing authorities on homeless services is a matter for individual housing authorities.</p><p>Exchequer funding is provided by my Department on a regional basis.

If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.   </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted.</p>  <p>  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. It is considered that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally adequate to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced a targeted rent increase restriction of 4% per annum in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords and local rental market factors. The aim was to provide rent certainty to tenants and landlords by moderating medium-term rent levels. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduces the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that an index, other than HICP, may be prescribed for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I will consider all the legal options available to me to ensure that effective rent controls are legally in force in RPZs to cap the rate of any rent increase where the general inflation rate is too high.  Any necessary provision relating to rent control in RPZs will be considered in the context of the impending Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021. My Department is currently examining this matter and the advices of the Office of the Attorney General will inform any changes in this area. </p>  <p>   The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. It remains the position that rent reviews in RPZs can occur no more frequently than annually. The most vulnerable tenants, impacted by Covid-19, also continue to be legally protected from rent increases and eviction under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  </p></reply>

This level of ambition and pace of development is vital to achieve a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy to facilitate the increased electrification of heat and transport. I recognise that this must be planned and delivered in a way that is in step with measures to protect our Marine Environment.  In this regard, my attention has been drawn to possible concerns with the construction of windfarms on sandbanks on the east coast of Ireland and the potential impact on the wildlife in these areas. </p><p>Importantly, earlier this year Ireland&rsquo;s first national marine spatial plan, the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), was established (<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/60e57-national-marine-planning-framework/</i>).  This statutory plan includes objectives and policies that must be considered in relation to all programmes, plan or policies, as well as consenting, approval or regulation in the maritime area, for example Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE). The NMPF includes several chapters concerning environmental matters, where appropriate these are aligned with and support Ireland&rsquo;s work under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Building on existing requirements where relevant, implementation of the NMPF will enhance consideration of environment-related matters in decision making in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area, including in relation to wildlife.</p><p>Specifically the NMPF contains considerable and significant robust protections of our Marine Environment, including Protected Marine Sites such as the Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation.  Individual marine sectors such as ORE and other Marine industry activities are also subject to similar Environmental protection policies throughout the NMPF. For example, ORE Policy 1 states; </p><p><i>''Proposals that assist the State in meeting the Government&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy targets, including the target of achieving 5GW of capacity in offshore wind by 2030 and proposals that maximise the long-term shift from use of fossil fuels to renewable electricity energy, in line with decarbonisation targets, should be supported.</i><b><i>All proposals will be rigorously assessed to ensure compliance with environmental standards and seek to minimise impacts on the marine environment, marine ecology and other maritime users.</i></b>&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Further environmental protections for Ireland&rsquo;s marine area are in the immediate pipeline, with policy work that increases our Marine Protected Areas ongoing. The final report of the MPA Advisory Group - established in 2019 to provide independent expert advice and recommendations on potential processes and requirements for expanding Ireland&rsquo;s marine protected areas network - has recently undergone an extensive public consultation. The consultation encouraged all stakeholders and the wider public to get involved by sharing their views on the process by which Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs is to be expanded.  Informed by the Expert Advisory report and consultation responses, my Department intends to begin developing legislation on MPAs later in 2021. This work is likely to continue into 2022 so that, in accordance with the Programme for Government, Ireland can realise our outstanding target of 10% MPA coverage of our maritime area as soon as is practicable and also facilitate the achievement of our aim for 30% coverage by 2030.</p><p>While the NMPF and future MPAs set the strategic context, my Department currently regulates marine-based activities under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended, through a system of leasing and licencing. Prior to the submission of a formal application for a foreshore consent, my Department conducts pre-application engagement with applicants to ensure familiarity with the requirements on applicants to provide comprehensive and robust environmental reports with their application for consideration. Any application for a Foreshore consent is subject to assessment under the relevant legislation such as S.I. No. 477/2011 - European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU). The proposed development or activity is the subject of public consultation and consultation with a number of prescribed bodies, as outlined in S.I. 353/2011 &ndash; Foreshore Regulations 2011, to provide expert observations and to propose conditions that should attach to any foreshore consent granted. The submissions of the public and prescribed bodies are fully considered as part of the overall application assessment process. The Marine Licence Vetting Committee also undertakes a comprehensive independent technical review of each application and makes a recommendation to me as to whether or not a foreshore consent should be granted in each case. </p><p>In August 2021, my Department published the full text of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Bill 2021 and the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum. The MAP Bill focuses on updating the legislation underpinning our marine decision making, and will replace the 1933 Foreshore Act, once enacted. Further information on the MAP Bill 2021 can be found at the following link; <i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/1e103-publication-of-maritime-area-planning-bill-2021/ </i></p><p>The MAP Bill seeks to establish in law a new regime for the maritime area which will replace existing State and development consent regimes and streamline arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle i.e. one state consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental assessment. </p><p>The MAP Bill will establish a new agency to regulate development in the Maritime Area &ndash; the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA). MARA&rsquo;s functions will include assessing and granting all Maritime Area Consents, granting licences for a number of activities in the Maritime Area (including environmental surveys), ensuring robust compliance through enforcement measures, and managing the existing State Foreshore portfolio of leases and licences.  In the interim, arrangements are in place to deal with the existing cases being examined under the Foreshore Acts, and to deal with the transition to the new regime. </p><p>To support implementation of the NMPF and MAP Bill, my Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and other stakeholders to develop statutory marine planning guidelines that will support best practice throughout the planning process for offshore renewable energy. </p></reply>

It applied to businesses most seriously affected by the restrictions. Automatic eligibility extended to hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, and various other sectors. Categories of commercial property, such as offices, industrial premises and banks were not automatically eligible, but may qualify if they can provide proof of serious impact to their local authority.  </p>  <p>  Such proof of serious financial impact includes evidence that the ratepayer is receiving support under the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) operated by the Revenue Commissioners or evidence that turnover from the relevant business activity in the claim period does not exceed 25% of the average weekly turnover in 2019 (or 2020 for new businesses).</p>  <p>  As provision has been made for businesses that do not automatically qualify to apply, there are no plans to broaden the scope of automatic eligibility nor are there plans to amend the conditions under which the waiver can be applied to ratepayers not automatically eligible. The 2021 waiver was necessarily more targeted than that which applied in 2020, reflecting the need to ensure public resources are directed where most needed. Ratepayers that did not qualify for the 2021 waiver should engage directly with the relevant local authority regarding payment options.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie  . </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, the homeowner is liable for the cost of the Building Condition Assessment.  The payment of costs will normally occur when the remediation works are completed and certified.

Affordability and the chance to own a home is at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s housing policy. It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. Pathway 1 &lsquo;Supporting homeownership and increasing affordability ' addresses this issue and sets out a number of key actions in this regard.  </p><p>The objective is to supply 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes per year. This includes an average of 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes made available each year for purchase or rent up to 2030. This will have a dramatic impact on the provision of housing and will significantly help facilitate house buyers. </p><p>Specifically, regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, <i>Housing for All </i>contains a multi-pronged approach to supply and improving affordability.</p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p><p>In addition, new higher-rate stamp duty measures and planning permission restrictions have been introduced that will minimise the bulk buying of traditional family homes. I also plan to introduce a new form of &lsquo;Owner-Occupier Guarantee&rsquo; which will enable Local Authorities to specify a minimum proportion of the houses in a new development for owner occupiers. </p><p>The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund will stimulate the activation of some apartment developments for sale to individual purchasers. The Land Development Agency (LDA), through Project Tosaigh, will intervene in slow or stalled developments with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p><p><i>Housing for All </i>is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the LDA and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. There is a targeted approach right across the country to supply housing where it is needed most. This is supported by updated planning guidance, additional State land provided for housing, and an increase in funding for Local authorities to acquire new land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale. Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home, including first-time buyers wishing to purchase an existing home.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p><p>Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils.</p><p>In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire appliances (engines). </p><p>Dublin City Council was allocated four new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in the latest Appliance Procurement Programme at an approximate cost of &euro;1.9m. Dublin City Council was also grant-aided to procure three new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in each of the 2015 and 2017 Programmes. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet is one of the key national priorities for the Fire Services Capital Programme.</p><p>In July 2019, the Council was approved to purchase a new turntable ladder/ aerial appliance at a cost of &euro;800,000 plus VAT. In September 2021, Dublin City Council requested approval for the purchase of a new turntable ladder at a cost of &euro;850,000.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>  - established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>  - state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?); and</p>  <p>  - value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that there was an historic project application in relation to the fire station in Rathdowney that did not eventually progress as proposed and that, in 2017, Laois County Council put in place an extension on to Rathdowney Fire Station, consisting of separate male and female toilets, a shower cubicle and a new muster bay. While a new fire station at Rathdowney is not currently included in my Department&rsquo;s 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme, it is included in a list for annual review. Laois County Council has indicated that a new fire station in Stradbally is their number one priority. My Department will have regard to this, and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide for funding, in considering any proposal.</p></reply>

This national level planning policy is being implemented at the regional level through the delivery of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) for each of the three Regional Assembly areas.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with section 23 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), the objective of an RSES is to provide a long-term strategic planning and economic framework for the development of each regional assembly areas that is consistent with the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the economic policies or objectives of the Government, and must be for a period of not less than 12 years and not more than 20 years. </p>  <p>  Section 27 of the Planning Act requires a local authority, when making a development plan or a local area plan, to ensure that the plan is consistent with any regional spatial and economic strategy in force for its area. I am also empowered under this section to determine, by order, that local authorities shall comply with any RSES in force for their area. </p>  <p>  Sections 27A and 27B of the Planning Act provide that where a planning authority is reviewing a development plan and has prepared a draft development plan, notice must be given to the relevant Regional Assembly. In each case the relevant regional assembly must  produce a report for submission to the planning authority in response.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 27B in particular, the report of the Regional Assembly must state whether, in the opinion of that assembly the draft development plan, and its core strategy, are consistent with the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) in force for the area of the development plan.  Where the Regional Assembly determines that the draft development plan is not consistent with the RSES, it must provide recommendations regarding appropriate amendments to the development plan.  </p>  <p>  In each case, a copy of the reports prepared by the Regional Assembly under Sections 27A and 27B are also sent to my Department and to the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR).  </p>  <p>  Similarly, where a local authority intends to make a variation to a development plan under Section 13 of the Planning and Development Act, Section 27C also requires the relevant regional assembly to prepare a report relating to the draft variation that shall state whether, in their opinion is consistent with the RSES and which if necessary, must include recommended amendments to ensure consistency. In the instance of a variation to a development plan, a copy of this report is also sent to my Department and the OPR. </p>  <p>  Unlike the Office of the Planning Regulator, the Regional Assemblies do not make direct reccomendations to me, as Minister, in respect of development plans.  However, in evaluating development plans under Section 31AM of the Planning and Development Act, the Regulator in assessing consistency with the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy, will have been copied the observation or submissions, including recommendations of the Regional Assembly that have been made to a planning authority under Sections 27A and 27B or 27C.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as Minister, I will also be aware of the report and submission of the Regional Assembly on a development plan, and consistency with the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy is a key consideration in forming an opinion whether to issue a direction under Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is sufficient oversight by the Regional Assemblies, the Office of the Planning Regulator and my Department of the city and county development plan process and the interaction between the county development plans and RSESs, to take account of any intervention that may be required to ensure appropriate planning and sustainable development principles over the lifetime of the RSES. </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils. The management of resources, equipment and the number and type of fire appliances is a matter for the City Council based on their assessment of local needs and requirements. Continued investment in the national fleet is one of the key priorities for my Department's Fire Services Capital Programme. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council was allocated four new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in the latest Appliance Procurement Programme at an approximate cost of &euro;1.9m. Dublin City Council was also grant-aided to procure three new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in both the 2015 and 2017 Programmes. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet is one of the key national priorities for the Fire Services Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department works with fire services in Dublin in relation to their priority projects. In July 2019, Dublin City Council was approved to purchase a new turntable ladder/ aerial appliance at a cost of &euro;800,000 plus VAT, delivery of which is due later this year. In September 2021, the Council requested approval for the purchase of a new turntable ladder at a cost of &euro;850,000. This application is under consideration in my Department and is likely to be approved in the immediate future. Fire appliances are acquired through a competitive tendering process.</p>  <p>  The management, disposition and deployment of its appliance fleet is a matter for the officers of Dublin Fire Brigade. I understand that Dublin Fire Brigade's fleet of aerial appliances consists of two turntable ladders based at Dublin Fire Brigade Headquarters in Tara Street, and a hydraulic platform based at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Fire Station, all of which can be deployed rapidly to anywhere in the functional area of the four local authorities. </p>  <p>  The appropriate fire safety measures, including facilities to assist fire service response, in any building are based on the scale, density and height of the building and are set out in national Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance and Codes of Practice. The Fire Safety Task Force established in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy, in its report of May 2018, states &ldquo;The key to life safety in all apartment buildings is a proper two-stage fire detection and alarm system, together with an evacuation strategy&hellip;&rdquo;. The primary statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of persons using any building rests with the persons having control of those buildings. The design and construction of buildings in the first instance, including inbuilt fire safety features such as building layout, means of escape and fire resistance are critical for protecting persons from fire. Safety features, such as fire detection and alarm systems, support safe evacuation of occupants and the containment of fires. </p>  <p>  In relation to fighting fires in high-rise buildings, my Department has issued guidance entitled &ldquo;Fighting Fires in High-Rise Buildings&rdquo;. This was part of a suite of 47 Standard Operational Guidance (SOG) documents developed between 2010 and 2012 by fire service personnel and issued by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.</p></reply>

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.</p><p>In relation to the specification of concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standards facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  <i>&lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo;</i>deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;<i>S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which </i>provides, inter alia, guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work in Ireland. S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC: 2019 recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which requires independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks).</p><p>Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, should meet the prescribed density, compressive strength and be made with dense aggregate conforming to &lsquo;I.S. EN 12620+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; and &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo;. Importantly, as aggregate is a key constituent of aggregate concrete blocks, &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016&rsquo; outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production.</p><p>A full list of designated Notified Bodies for construction products may be found on the New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information Systemhosted by the European Commission.</p><p>Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.</p><p>While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011  . Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013)  , each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas.</p><p>In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p><p>Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p><p>Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:</p><p>- when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,</p><p>- when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,</p><p>- check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and</p><p>- ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for the use for whichthey are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p><p>In relation to <i>&lsquo;poured concrete&rsquo;</i>(commonly called ready-mix concrete), the current European standard is <i>&lsquo;I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021, Concrete - Part 1: Specification, performance, production and conformity&rsquo;</i>.  This standard requires the manufacturers of ready-mix concrete to demonstrate conformity to a series of specified requirements. Manufacturers must issue a formal Declaration of Conformity along with relevant documentation before they can dispatch ready-mix concrete. </p><p>As <i>I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021</i>is not a harmonised standard within the scope of the CPR, NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of an Irish National Annex, which specifies among other requirements, the recommended limiting values required for concrete mixes for the various exposure classes. These values are applicable to the specification or use of concrete in Ireland. <i>I.S. EN 206-1+A2:2021</i>places significant responsibility upon manufacturers of ready-mix concrete to demonstrate conformity to a series of specified requirements.</p><p>NSAI has also put in place a product certification scheme covering ready-mix concrete. This entails an initial inspection of the concrete plant focusing on:</p><p>- The production control manual and the degree of conformity to I.S. EN 206&ndash;1 and National Annex;</p><p>- Inspection of relevant documentation,</p><p>- Facilities and equipment,</p><p>- Staff training, experience and knowledge,</p><p>- Issuing a Certificate of Conformity.</p><p>All the relevant information from the initial inspection and assessment of the system is documented in an NSAI Assessment Report. This report will be issued after the plant has passed the initial inspection, along with a Certificate of Conformity to I.S. EN 206-1:2002 and Irish National Annex.</p><p>To maintain certification, qualified NSAI personnel will continue to carry out regular inspections. As a minimum, the following will be examined:</p><p>- Sampling and testing procedures,</p><p>- Recorded data,</p><p>- Test results obtained for production control during the inspection period,</p><p>- Frequency of required tests or procedures,</p><p>- Scheduled production equipment checks and maintenance,</p><p>- Scheduled test equipment maintenance and calibration,</p><p>- Actions taken with respect to any non-conformity,</p><p>- Delivery tickets, and the Declaration of Conformity where relevant,</p><p>- Maintenance of the production control system.</p><p>NSAI also take ongoing spot samples to verify the accuracy of the producer&rsquo;s routine testing procedures.  Where significant changes are made to facilities at the production place, system or manual, the producer must notify these changes to NSAI. Following review, NSAI may determine that an on-site re-inspection is appropriate.</p><p>Finally, the overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations  1997-2021 requires that all works should be carried out:</p><p>- Using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p><p>- With a proper standard of workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.</p><p>- By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.</p><p>The primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations 1997-2021 rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Interpretation of the legislation is, ultimately, a matter for the Courts and implementation of the Building Control system is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.</p></reply>

Following a Call for Proposals from AHBs in December 2020, a rigorous assessment process was undertaken by my Department and the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  In February 2021, I announced approval-in-principle for the CREL financing of 390 new homes at eight sites across Ireland this year, to be owned, managed and maintained by the Cl&uacute;id, Respond and Tuath AHBs. These projects are located in Dublin, the surrounding Greater Dublin Area and Cork City, with each development delivering cost-covering rents for homes on average at least 25% below comparable open market prices.</p>  <p>  In total, approximately 115 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by end 2021.  The first of these which were CREL-financed homes, have been delivered by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, where tenants moved in to their new homes at the end of August. The cost-covering rents for these Taylor Hill homes are averaging 38% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house. The Cl&uacute;id AHB owns, manages and maintains the 25 homes, which they acquired with the assistance of a &euro;2.4m CREL loan. A further 50 Cost Rental apartments are due for completion shortly at Enniskerry Road, for which tenancy applications have already been accepted.</p>  <p>  Delivery of CREL homes is subject to construction schedules, which, together with housing projects more generally, were impacted by COVID delays at the beginning of this year. The initial timeframes submitted by AHBs were based on all efforts being made to deliver the homes as soon as possible. As AHBs sought to use CREL funding to allow developers to construct homes that may otherwise not have been delivered, the commencement of construction on these specific units was, in most instances, not possible until the lifting of relevant COVID restrictions. </p>  <p>  The revised timeframes for delivery under the first CREL call are currently being collated. Based on delivery estimations from the relevant AHBs, a further estimated 134 additional Cost Rental homes under CREL 1 call will be in place by end Q1 2021.  The remaining CREL homes will come on stream by Q4 2022.</p>  <p>  Affordable homes on local authority land are to be made available through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). Currently, 40 AHF projects, across 14 local authorities, have received approval in principle and will assist in the delivery of just over 4,200 affordable homes to buy or to rent. </p>  <p>  The pilot Cost Rental development at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which has benefitted from AHF subvention, will see cost-covering rents for 50 two-bedroom apartments of &euro;1,200 per month, in an area where comparable market rents are c. &euro;2,000 per month. The first affordable purchase homes supported by AHF funding, will be delivered in Quarter 4 of 2021 at Boherboy Road, Cork City.</p>  <p>  Just one year after coming in to office, this Government had introduced what is a brand new form of tenure in Cost Rental.  It has placed Cost Rental on a statutory basis through the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever stand-alone affordable housing legislation in the State. It has established administrative provisions and provided the funds which have seen the first tenants already in long-term and secure homes, at up to 50% of the comparable market cost.</p>  <p>  The Government recently confirmed plans to significantly increase delivery and the Housing for All Strategy is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. Over the period 2021 to 2030, it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Land Development Agency. In building to this scale and with an average of 2,000 Cost Rental Units per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners to provide rental homes, targeting affordable rents at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.</p></reply>

Having regard to feedback from local authorities, a number of significant improvements to the funding scheme, now named the Affordable Housing Funding (AHF) scheme, have been agreed and communicated to local authorities by way of Circular in June 2021.  </p>  <p>  For those SSF schemes that are currently under construction, the Covid pandemic has had an impact on the projected timelines for delivery of housing, due to the closure of the construction sector earlier this year.  Accordingly, the first projects to be delivered in 2021 will be the pilot Cost Rental project at Enniskerry Road and the first affordable purchase homes will be the first phase of the Boherboy Road scheme in Cork City.  There will be 8 affordable purchase homes delivered in this first phase of this development.</p>  <p>  The Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to step up housing supply and put affordability at the heart of the housing system, with an ambitious target of 300,000 homes over the next decade for social, affordable and cost rental, private rental and private ownership housing.</p>  <p>  Measures to deliver this housing are supported by over &euro;4 billion in funding annually, representing the highest ever level of Government investment in building social and affordable housing.  54,000 affordable homes interventions will be delivered between now and 2030 to be facilitated by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  Delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 and the funding being made available, will be underpinned by the preparation by local authorities of Housing Delivery Action Plans.   Local authorities will be submitting their Plans to me, to include social and affordable housing, before the end of December 2021. This will allow each Local Authority to determine any affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly.</p></reply>

The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland through specific National Policy Objectives (NPOs) that aim to support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland and deliver strengthened and diversified rural communities. NPO 19 aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant &lsquo;overspill&rsquo; development pressure from urban areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and remoter rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. </p>  <p>  NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines will ensure a more consistent approach between counties and alignment with NPF objectives, and will be published in draft before the end of 2021.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of emergency accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department does not fund any homeless services directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards costs incurred on the provision of services.  Under these funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources.  Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of these funding arrangements with my Department.  Therefore, the exact spend by housing authorities on homeless services is a matter for individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding is provided through my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis. Limerick is included in the Mid West region for the purposes of homeless administration, along with Clare.  In 2020 a total of &euro;9.2 million was recouped to the Mid West region towards its regional homeless services programme and funding recouped towards expenditure incurred in implementing exceptional Covid-19 measures.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  As a result of the imminent introduction of the revised exempted development regulations in respect of solar panels and subject to compliance with the conditions attached to the relevant proposed exemptions, there will be no need to seek planning permission for a wide range of solar developments in the above-mentioned classes of buildings. Accordingly, no planning permission fees will apply in this regard.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, article 157 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2021 sets out certain exemptions from the payment of fees for planning applications for development which 'in the opinion of the planning authority, is development proposed to be carried out by or on behalf of a voluntary organisation, and which in the opinion of the planning authority...is designed or intended to be used for social, recreational, educational or religious purposes by the inhabitants of a locality, or by people of a particular group or religious denomination, and is not to be used mainly for profit or gain...'.</p>  <p>  The application of this specific fee exemption provision is a matter for the relevant planning authority and my Department has no role in relation to the matter. </p></reply>

Many thousands of Irish emigrants fleeing Ireland at that time found refuge and a new home in the United States, and many of these are the ancestors of the 30 million Americans who now claim Irish heritage.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Great Hunger Museum on the grounds of Quinnipiac University campus holds an impressive collection of art, artefacts and literature related to the Famine. Showcasing collections such as these is important in ensuring the story of where the Irish people came from is not forgotten, and the Museum has played an important role in that. </p>  <p>  The Government of Ireland believes it important that a new home be found for this collection in the months ahead. The aim should be to re-house the collection so that the works it contains remain accessible to the public and researchers alike. Should another museum or institution be identified to host the collection, my Department would be happy to discuss if there are any ways we can offer support.</p></reply>

That Department is now establishing an Afghan Admission Programme which will enable current or former Afghan nationals living legally in Ireland to apply to have close family members, who are living in Afghanistan or who have recently fled to territories bordering Afghanistan, considered for temporary Irish residence.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome this new proposal from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, which will create a tailored reunification programme and enable Ireland to continue to respond to the situation in Afghanistan. Up to 500 places will be available under this programme. Meanwhile, the current possibilities for Afghan nationals to be granted permission to enter Ireland will continue in parallel to the new programme. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs does not ordinarily provide assistance on individual travel arrangements to those who have been granted visas to Ireland. However, my Department is, through our diplomatic network, liaising with relevant authorities in the region and elsewhere on possible transit routes. EU coordination is playing an important role in this. </p>  <p>  The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have stated publicly that any Afghan citizen with travel authorisation and documentation from other countries will be allowed to proceed in a safe and orderly manner to points of departure and to travel outside the country over the coming period. However, the extent to which this will be followed through on remains to be seen, and we are continuing, with our partners, to monitor and engage on the situation. We are also continuing to provide travel advice to assist people in making decisions on potential transit options. </p></reply>

We work actively at bilateral and EU level and through the UN on the issue of compliance with international law in the occupied Palestinian territory. </p>  <p>  At EU level, I met with Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, along with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 July. I underlined Ireland&rsquo;s concern about the impact of Israeli government policies and practices on the human rights of Palestinian in the occupied Palestinian territory and called for their human rights to be ensured in law, in policy and in practice.</p>  <p>  I spoke to the Foreign Minister Lapid again on 30 August. I underlined the need for compliance with international law. I hope to visit the region in the coming weeks and will raise these issues further with my interlocutors.</p>  <p>  On 29 September Ireland chaired the Council&rsquo;s monthly meeting on the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question. This meeting focused on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which includes the issue of illegal settlements, violence against civilians and de-escalation and reversal of negative trends on the ground. At that meeting, Ireland highlighted the need for full compliance with Resolution 2334, which calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. In this respect Ireland ensures that any bilateral agreements with Israel do not apply to territories occupied by Israel since 1967.</p>  <p>  In May, Ireland supported a special session of the Human Rights Council on the escalation of violence. The Human Rights Council voted to establish a Commission of Inquiry on the oPt at this session. In keeping with our principled position on Commissions of Inquiry established by the HRC, Ireland supports the work of this Commission. </p>  <p>  At the Security Council on 29 September, Ireland unreservedly condemned the incidence of settler violence on 28 September in the South Hebron Hills in which a young child was seriously injured, calling on the Israeli authorities to hold those responsible accountable and to end the culture of impunity around all such incidents of violence.</p>  <p>  I have often spoken on the issue of illegal demolitions of educational facilities by Israeli authorities. In November 2020, in relation to the threat of demolition of the Ras Al-Teen school, I called on Israel to cease this reprehensible practice and ensure children&rsquo;s basic human right to education in a safe and secure school environment. Ireland also provides practical support to enable access to quality education for Palestinian children. This includes support to UNRWA, which provides free basic education for over 530,000 Palestine refugee children, and to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. </p></reply>

Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are served by our collective effort. </p>  <p>  Ireland has welcomed the WHO-led Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) as an important initiative. It has the potential to facilitate pooled rights to technologies that can be used for the detection, prevention, control and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Under the arrangement, owners of intellectual property (IP) and other forms of knowledge, data and skills relevant for the development and manufacture of tests, equipment, therapeutics and vaccines would make these available, voluntarily, and to facilitate the expansion of production. </p>  <p>  Neither I nor officials in my Department have met with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry or pharmaceutical companies to discuss the C-TAP initiative or the Covid-19 waiver proposed at the WTO Council on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights.   The European Commission, on behalf of Member States, has been engaging with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to obtain the additional information and clarifications required for industry to engage in the initiative, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment the lead Department on trade issues.  A well-functioning system for the protection, enforcement, and appropriate sharing of intellectual property rights is an important incentive for the research and development of vaccines, medicines and equipment. Ireland, through the EU, will remain open to identifying innovative ways to support these aims, as part of our comprehensive response to the global challenge. </p>  <p>  Ireland has shown support for sharing COVID-19 related knowledge and research outputs in a number of ways. This includes engagement in the National Open Research Forum, and the granting of non-exclusive royalty-free licenses through Knowledge Transfer Ireland. It includes Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s alignment with Plan S, an initiative to ensure publicly funded research is openly available, immediately, without embargo for the betterment of societal needs. We have also support the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Ireland has allocated &euro;100 million in support of Global Health activities, including the COVID-19 response. My Department works with relevant multilateral agencies to support health systems (including the COVID-19 response) and ensuring attention is sustained to other diseases.  To promote equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low and middle income countries, I have allocated &euro;7 million in support of COVAX (the global Covid-19 vaccine facility), and supported the WHO role in ensuring equity and fairness in the process. Ireland has recently donated 335,500 vaccines to Uganda and is in the process of donating a further million through the COVAX facility.</p></reply>

I have engaged extensively with both the Government of Yemen and countries of the region this year to urge them to work urgently and constructively towards a sustainable peace. At the High Level Week in New York last month, I met with the Foreign Ministers of Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran, urging all to support efforts towards peace in Yemen. </p>  <p>  The EU also continues its active diplomatic outreach to relevant actors in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy. During his recent visit to the Gulf from 30 September &ndash; 4 October, EU HRVP Josef Borrell reiterated European Union support to the UN-led peace efforts. </p></reply>

I call for an end to violence, the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained, including the President and State Counsellor, and the restoration of a legitimate, democratic civilian Government. </p><p>As a result of the coup, there is a political and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. The situation remains grave, and continues to deteriorate. More that 500,000 people have been displaced and are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The country is suffering from conflict, severe economic recession, large-scale displacement, collapsing public and health services and a significant surge in COVID-19 cases. This crisis affects not just Myanmar, but threatens the stability of the region. Ireland supports an urgent, international effort to address pressing humanitarian issues within Myanmar.</p><p>Ireland continues to provide support and assistance for the most vulnerable communities in Myanmar and I have called on the Myanmar military to allow unhindered access to all regions for humanitarian workers. </p><p>My Department continues to provide significant resources to humanitarian partners in Myanmar, with approximately &euro;2.5 million approved for 2021 to date.  In July, the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS) was activated in support of a project to ensure that women and girls affected by the crisis in the conflict affected Kayah State are protected from, and treated for, the consequences of Gender Based Violence.</p><p>My Department is also engaged in regular discussions with the European Union, United Nations (UN) structures, International NGOs, Human Rights Groups and other organisations working actively on the ground.</p><p>Ireland supports the adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them. In this regard, I endorsed the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on February 22 and the adoption of sanctions on 22 March, 19 April and 21 June. We continue to work with the EU to consider further actions which will work to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and not negatively affect developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation.</p><p>Ireland also continues to actively engage with discussions at the UN Security Council. The Council must consider how it can contribute to a democratic resolution to the crisis. We cannot just not stand by and watch the current situation be normalised and the actions of the Tatmadaw, in seizing power and utilising brutal force against their own citizens, go without rebuke. </p><p>Through the UN and our Embassy network, my Department is encouraging all those who have influence on the military leadership to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that captial allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This will enable continued investment in Defence major equipment platforms and barracks infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquirer two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.

Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Agency provides access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.  This is important in terms of Ireland's ability to participate in UN mandated Peacekeeping Operations.  Ireland contributes, on an annual basis, to the operational budget of the EDA.  The financial commitment to this budget is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on gross national income (GNI) key.  A total of &euro;7,596,093 has been made to the EDA over the seventeen years since Ireland joined in 2004, which includes both contributions to the operational budget and also to capability development projects which Ireland has or is participating in.  </p>  <p>  The Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD) is a process which aims to create greater transparency by sharing Member States information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment. Participation in CARD is open to all Member States on a voluntary basis, recognising that the defence policies of Member States, including defence spending and capabilities, is entirely a national competence.  The EDA and the EU Military Staff (EUMS) act as the CARD Secretariat.  Defence Forces personnel and Department of Defence staff participate in EDA and CARD meetings where relevant and appropriate, any costs arising would be in relation to travel to these meetings.</p>  <p>  The establishment of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is currently participating in one PESCO project and is an observer on a further nine projects. To date, no additional costs have been incurred through PESCO related activities other than costs associated with attendance by Defence Forces Subject Matter Experts at PESCO project planning meetings.  </p>  <p>  The EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen) is an Agency working for the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union under the Political Supervision of the Political and Security Committee and the Operational Direction of the High Representative, which is governed by a Council Joint Action. In the international security and defence field, it handles sensitive and classified data to support CSDP military operations and civilian missions.  The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs contribute to the budget of the EU SatCen.  Over the 14 years since 2007, the total contribution to the budget of the Sat Cen by the Department of Defence is &euro;1,180,701.  Defence Forces Personnel attend the EU SatCen Technical Expert Group meetings and Brussels based Department of Defence staff attend the Board meetings, any costs arising from attendance at these meetings would be in relation to travel. </p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for Common Security Defence Policy operations. The fund is designed to foster innovation to address new security and defence challenges and allow economies of scale through greater industrial and research cooperation and enhancing the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. It facilitates Member States to better coordinate and supplement national investments in defence and to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not otherwise be feasible. Member State contributions to the EU Budget (Own Resources) are currently calculated annually by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resources Decision (ORD) Regulation (2014/335). EU Budget revenue is general, and is not assigned to any particular fund. As such, the EDF does not have a defined cost to the Exchequer.  Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF.  The EDF is encompassed within the funding being provided for the Multiannual Financial Framework which is funded directly by the Exchequer.  The EDF Progamme Committee meetings are attended by Brussels based Department of Defence staff. </p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations. These costs are currently financed by the new European Peace Facility (EPF) which has replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Both the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility were established in 2004 and operated until 2021.  </p>  <p>  Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP), previously handled by the Athena mechanism The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility.  In addition, the EPF can extend financing for peace-support operations to partners other than the African Union and provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, the European Council agreed a &euro;5bn financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds will require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure and an annual ceiling for each of the seven years is set out in the Council Decision establishing the EPF.  Brussels-based Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs staff attend EPF Committee meetings in the course of their normal duties. </p></reply>

I understand the Deputy has put a similar question to Minister O'Gorman.</p><p>The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  </p><p>The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.</p><p>My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  </p><p>Last month, I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science recently to provide an update on a number of issues including the measures that are being taken to prevent and tackle bullying in schools. </p><p>During my appearance at the Joint Committee, I announced that my Department will commence a review of my Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools.  </p><p>This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying and gender identity bullying. The procedures will continue to make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying.</p><p>This work will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students.</p><p>I also announced that during this school year, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. </p><p>As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work will be a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.</p><p>My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p><p>In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.</p><p>Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives.  This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. </p><p>As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. </p><p>In 2019, the NCCA published a curriculum audit on Traveller history and culture. The audit identified areas across the curriculum where teachers could teach about aspects of Traveller history and culture. The audit addressed the curriculum from Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary. The audit is available at: <i>ncca.ie/media/4613/travellerculturehistory.pdf</i></p><p>Progression of the findings commenced with the appointment of a full-time NCCA Education Officer in September 2020. The work of the NCCA on traveller culture and history arising from the audit will continue into 2022.</p></reply>

The Steering Group is leading on the identification of issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and overseeing its implementation. It is supported by an Implementation Group and a number of working groups which are considering specific areas of policy.</p><p>The Teacher Supply Action Plan, published in November 2018, includes a range of actions under four policy headings: data/research to support teacher supply planning; higher education; policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply; and communications / promotion of the teaching profession.</p><p>A number of measures have been put in place to increase the supply of teachers at post-primary level, particularly in subjects where difficulties in recruitment have been reported.</p><p>Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), higher education institutions (HEIs) put in place new post-primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 and 2020 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages, computer science and Irish.</p><p>In addition the HEA, on behalf of my Department, issued a call to ITE providers for proposals for programmes to upskill registered teachers in targeted post-primary subjects (Spanish, mathematics and physics).  The programmes, which commenced in January 2021, will run over two years on a part-time, flexible basis.  There is no fee charge for participating teachers.</p><p>Earlier this year I, along with my colleague Minister Harris, announced an additional programme to upskill teachers in Irish, to begin in 2022. My Department is currently engaging with the HEA in regard to a call to ITE providers for the provision of this programme.</p><p>A number of measures have been taken by education partners which are aimed at matching teachers  with teaching vacancies. <i>Turasabhaile</i>, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, matches registered teachers, resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools here at home. The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p><p>In November 2019, my Department published a technical report<b></b>&ldquo;Developing a Teacher Demand and Supply Model for Ireland 2020-2036&rdquo;.  The report was updated in May 2021 with projections of teacher demand and supply to 2038.  Ultimately, the intention is to establish a robust data based model for the effective projection of future teacher demand and supply across the school system.</p><p>The report projects that, at post-primary level, the demand for teachers, on a no policy change basis, will follow a largely downward trend to 2032. It is important to note that the report&rsquo;s projections are based on high level demographics and to demonstrate trends in demand and supply. Work is ongoing in my Department to produce projections of post primary teacher demand and supply on a subject level basis to inform future teacher supply planning.</p><p>The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the <i>Teaching Transforms</i>campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, .</p><p>My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

The Substitute Teacher Supply Panel was extended and currently almost 380 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers are employed, providing substitute cover to over 2,500 schools across the country.  These substitute Supply Panels are not the sole means whereby schools source substitutes but are set up to work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers such as through a school&rsquo;s own panel of regular substitutes or the national substitution portal service &quot;Sub Seeker&quot;, operated by IPPN.  </p><p>As a measure of last resort, schools were permitted to use non-mainstream class teachers last year to provide cover for teacher absences in limited circumstances.  Due to the successful roll out of the vaccination programme, teacher absences due to Covid-19 should be reduced this year.  Therefore using non-mainstream class teachers should no longer be necessary and schools should revert to using the normal sequence of filling substitute positions and should plan to ensure access to substitutes in this manner.  This will ensure that the disruption to teaching and learning provided by non-classroom teachers will be avoided.</p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  DES Circulars 0072019 set out how the allocations for schools are being updated from September 2019.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations. A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: www.nsce.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

Hours accumulated in any given school year must be utilised in the same school year.  </p><p>Where hours were accumulated due to a school receiving a backdated increase to their Special Education Teaching hours, or due to a Special Education Teacher being used to cover substitution, as an emergency measure, schools were advised that any loss of special education teaching time should be made up at the first available opportunity by employing additional teaching resources to make up for the shortfall.</p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools are being updated from September 2019.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: <i>ncse.ie/for-schools</i></p></reply>

Hours accumulated in any given school year must be utilised in the same school year.  </p><p>Where hours were accumulated due to a school receiving a backdated increase to their Special Education Teaching hours, or due to a Special Education Teacher being used to cover substitution, as an emergency measure, schools were advised that any loss of special education teaching time should be made up at the first available opportunity by employing additional teaching resources to make up for the shortfall.</p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools are being updated from September 2019.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: <i>ncse.ie/for-schools</i></p></reply>

The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project. </p><p>My Department is taking an integrated approach with the Prefab Replacement Programme through the replacement of prefabricated units as part of large-scale and devolved projects, or as part of new projects approved under the Additional School Accommodation scheme.  </p></reply>

The Schools Reconfiguration process, along with approaches such as the patronage divesting process, voluntary reassignments of patronage under Section 8 of the Education Act 1998 and the patronage process for new schools, which includes consideration of parental preferences for different types of school patron, will contribute to the achievement of this target.  In recent years there has been progress towards increasing the numbers of multi-denominational primary schools with the vast majority of new primary schools established to cater for demographic demand in the last decade having a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools across the country.  This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.  </p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic Bishops) with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools.  In addition, an Irish-medium gaelscoil has recently changed patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  From September 2021, this school offers parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an Ethics and Morality Program and, for parents who so chose, a Catholic programme is provided. </p>  <p>  School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance. </p></reply>

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing IT provision.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support. </p><p>Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. Professional reports (from psychologists or occupational therapists, for example) must be submitted by the school along with the application. These reports must have a recent and comprehensive professional assessment of the nature and extent of disability, and outline that the equipment is essential for the pupil to access the curriculum.</p><p>Equipment may only be provided where medical and/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this. </p><p>The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p><p>SENOs review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. A recommendation is then made to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department decides on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.</p><p>The SENO for this case recommended that Assistive Technology be approved for this pupil in the form of a laptop up to the maximum value of &euro; 550 plus software giving a total grant due of &euro; 980.70. On foot of this decision and in line with procedures an appeal was received on the grounds that amount provided was insufficient for equipment necessary. </p><p>The Department sought further clarity from the SENO with regard to the appropriateness or requirement for the provision of equipment applied for. Having reviewed the case, the NCSE agree that 980.70 is sufficient to purchase suitable equipment to access the curriculum and the decision was made not to increase the amount originally sanctioned. This decision has been conveyed to the school.</p><p>It was informed to the school that many lightweight laptops on the market that can be purchased for less than &euro; 550 on which Dragon Naturally Speaking software can be uploaded, and the SENO has confirmed this. </p><p>Separately, where an appeal has been unsuccessful, but if new information becomes available,  it is open to the school to submit a new application to the SENO for consideration.</p><p>It is also open to parents to contact SENOs directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at: <i>www.ncse.ie/seno-contact-list</i></p></reply>

In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.   </p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements at primary level include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.

The Department is currently processing enrolment returns from schools. </p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.

The L1 specification is aimed at students in Irish medium schools, including native speakers, and the L2 specification is aimed at students in English medium schools where Irish is taught as a second language. Schools participating in the Gaeltacht recognition scheme will be required to provide at least the L1 specification and English medium schools will have the option of providing the L1 and/or the L2 depending on the needs of students. </p>  <p>  The NCCA is using a range of consultation techniques including an online survey, focus group and bilateral meetings, and written submissions to gather and record the experiences and perspectives of participants on all aspects of the draft specifications, including the types of learning, teaching and assessment experiences set out for students.  Bi-lateral discussions, information sessions and consultative focus groups continued over the summer period with stakeholders not directly involved in school settings.</p>  <p>  Based on stakeholder feedback to-date, stakeholder requests and given the challenging contexts in which our schools, teachers and students have been operating under due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the NCCA extended the current consultation period until the end of November 2021. The online consultation surveys will remain open until 5pm on 30 November 2021, while written submissions will also be accepted until that time. Once the consultation closes, a detailed analysis of all feedback will be conducted and an interim consultation report will be presented to NCCA Council in early 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to the consultation on the new draft Leaving Certificate specifications, the NCCA are undertaking an early enactment review of the new Junior Cycle Irish L1 and L2  specifications. This review will provide teachers and students with opportunities to share their insights, experiences, and views on implementing the Junior Cycle Irish specifications to-date.

Where a school employs a staff member to support these functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.   </p>  <p>  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.  This will take place via direct engagement with the unions in the coming weeks in addition to engagement on other elements of the claim and subject to all elements being agreed.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September and I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p> <blockquote> 	- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<br /><br />- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<br /><br />- Provision of a new school or schools.  </blockquote>  <p>The New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) is an external independent advisory group which was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools. A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. </p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  A prospective patron can choose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (where applicable).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p><p>Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review. Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with Dublin City Council in respect of its review of the Dublin City Development Plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements.</p></reply>

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing IT provision.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support. </p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department&rsquo;s officials will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making such recommendations, as set out in Circular 0010/2013.  </p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has not received an application for Assistive Technology from the school in respect of this pupil. Accordingly, I suggest that the parent contacts the school with regard to the kind of supports required by the child in question.  The local SENO will also be in position to advise in this regard.</p></reply>

This equates to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment over a person&rsquo;s working life.  It should be noted that having a minimum of 520 full-rate contributions does not automatically entitle an applicant to the maximum rate of State pension (contributory).  It is the qualifying threshold that must be satisfied so that an applicant&rsquo;s pension entitlement can be calculated, based on their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The interim Total Contributions Approach introduced in January 2018 did not alter the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) set out in social welfare legislation.  </p>  <p>  Individual pension entitlement depends on factors such as a person&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce and their countries of employment.  It is advisable that all contributors maintain their social insurance record as fully as possible over their working life.  They may also have the option of applying to be a voluntary contributor. </p>  <p>  Under European Union regulations, the insurance records of other Member States can be combined with an applicant&rsquo;s Irish contribution record to determine entitlement to a proportional or pro rata pension.  </p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory), or qualify for a reduced rate of pension, the State pension (non-contributory) is an alternative means-tested, residency-based payment for persons of pension age.

It suspended an employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy from their employer following certain periods of layoff and short-time work.  During periods of COVID related public health restrictions and sectoral shut downs,  Government was concerned that the financial impact of significant redundancy claims on employers would have a serious impact on the potential for businesses to recover post COVID, resulting in insolvency situations and exacerbating the risk of further permanent job losses.    With the successful roll-out of the vaccination programme, the public health situation has improved and with the economy re-opening, the emergency provision was considered no longer necessary. This  provision expired on 30th September 2021.</p>  <p>   In situations where employers are genuinely unable to meet their financial obligations to pay statutory redundancy to their employees due to financial difficulties or insolvency, the State can fund statutory redundancy payments under the redundancy payments scheme from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) on their behalf on an interim basis. The employee entitlements are paid from the SIF and a debt is raised against the employer.  In order to support employers, a flexible and discretionary approach is taken in relation to recovery of the redundancy debt over a phased basis.</p>  <p>  The estimate of SIF expenditure for the redundancy payments scheme included in the Revised Estimate for 2021 was &euro;43.3m. This was based on an expected earlier economic reopening in 2021 than actually transpired.  At this time, it is difficult to estimate how many redundancies in the economy are likely following the expiry of Section 12a at the end of September.  This will largely depend on the level and pace of economic recovery.   Many people have returned to employment as the economy re-opened over the summer. For example, the number of people on the PUP has fallen to just over 101,000 in the first week of October, its lowest level to date.  While many sectors are rebounding relatively quickly once restrictions are lifted, redundancies in some businesses will regrettably arise.  However, with 2021 expenditure to date on redundancy running at &euro;15m, it is not anticipated that the full provision for this year will be required. It will be later in the year and into 2022 before the impact of lifting of Section 12A in terms of the number of redundancies and its implications for SIF expenditure will become apparent.</p></reply>

For example, the last two Budgets have, in fact, seen a series of evidence-based increases in some social welfare payments targeted to improve the situation of the people who are most at risk of poverty and to ensure the most vulnerable were protected. </p><p>While core rates for pensioners remained unchanged in Budgets 2020 and 2021, measures were introduced which sought to protect some of the most vulnerable groups, including many pensioners.</p><p>In recognition of research which indicates that those who are aged 65 years and over are more likely to be at risk of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty if they live alone, the Living Alone Allowance was increased by &euro;10 per week over the course of Budgets 2020 and 2021.  This brought the rate from &euro;9 to &euro;19 per week.</p><p>To take account of increased costs arising as a result of increases to the carbon tax, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;2 per week in Budget 2020 and a further &euro;3.50 per week in Budget 2021.  This raised the weekly rate of payment from &euro;22.50 in 2019 to &euro;28 currently.</p><p>As a result of these targeted measures, some of the most vulnerable social welfare recipients have already seen increases significantly above the rate of inflation over this period.  For example, during the fuel season, a pensioner or person with a disability living alone is up to &euro;15.50 per week better off.  In addition, on a once-off basis in 2020, the fuel season was extended by four weeks, in recognition of the fact that many people were spending more time at home due to the Covid-19 lockdown. </p><p>In considering options for the forthcoming Social Welfare Budget package, I will once again take careful account of evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the CSO, the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  Taking an evidence-based approach ensures that available resources are used to deliver maximum impact in terms of reducing poverty and disadvantage. </p></reply>

These include -</p> <blockquote> 	-  The Fuel Allowance which is a payment of &euro;28 per week for 28 weeks (giving a total per recipient of &euro;784 each year) from October to April (estimated to cost &euro;300 million in 2021).<br /><br />-  Electricity or gas allowances under the Household Benefits scheme (at an estimated cost in 2021 of &euro;195 million).<br /><br />-  A special heating supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.<br /><br />-  Exceptional needs payments to help meet an essential once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. </blockquote>  <p>In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  Accordingly, with effect from January 2021, I increased the Fuel Allowance by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that provision of income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing energy costs.  One of the best ways to tackle energy costs in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  </p><p>This year funds raised through the carbon tax will again support targeted social welfare and other initiatives to alleviate fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  In this regard, in budget 2022, the Government will be considering how it can support people on low incomes and those on social welfare payments.  Any such measures can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.

The Commission stated that the records of St Gerard&rsquo;s which it examined are part of the very large archive of records relating to St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild. It was acknowledged that, at the time of the investigation, it was unable to extract specific records in relation to St Gerard&rsquo;s.  However, during its investigation, the Commission cross-referenced information from the institutional records available to it, State records, testimony from witnesses and evidence from other sources, in order to reach its conclusions. There are a number of such citations in relation to "Chapter 27: St Gerard&rsquo;s, originally 39 Mountjoy Square" of the Commission's final report.</p>  <p>  The Commission has now been dissolved in law. My Department does not have comparable powers to access records or compel persons to provide information. I have no plans to re-investigate the findings made by the Independent Commission, nor does my Department have the statutory powers to do so.</p>  <p>  Notably, the Commission's terms of reference specifically acknowledge the importance of its work in supporting further historical research. I, therefore, welcome future academic research into these matters, and the Government has committed to supporting further research and access to records as key parts of our response to the Commission&rsquo;s Report. </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, the Commission&rsquo;s Report is not the end of the State&rsquo;s response to mother and baby and county home institutions. It provides the initial basis on which we are building a series of responses to the needs and concerns of survivors and their families. </p></reply>

The work of the Committee will help to strengthen the Government&rsquo;s approach to combatting individual and institutional racism and will build on the anti-racism actions included in the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS) and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). The Committee will also examine international best practice in combatting racism and will benchmark its actions against these standards.</p>  <p>  On the same day as the publication of their Interim Report, the Committee launched the public consultation phase of its work, which ran for twelve weeks from 21 April until 14 July. During this phase, the Committee accepted written submissions, conducted an online survey, and held a series of consultation sessions with stakeholders  in order better to understand the nature and different forms of racism that are present in Ireland today.   The Irish Traveller Movement attended a number of these consultation sessions, including the one on Education, and sent in a written submission.</p>  <p>  Having completed its public consultation, the Anti-Racism Committee is now engaged in the preparation of the National Action Plan Against Racism, with a view to submitting a draft Plan to me for consideration in the coming months.  I then intend to bring this Plan to Government and, subject to the agreement of the Government, hope to publish it early next year. </p></reply>

My colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D. spoke at the launch of the ESRI report that the Deputy refers to, an event organised by the National Disability Authority which also saw the launch of a similarly employment-focused report by the OECD.</p>  <p>  Both reports are receiving detailed consideration by officials in my Department, particularly in the context of the design of the next Action Plan for 2022-2024 of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES) 2015 - 2024.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES) 2015 - 2024 is the primary vehicle for advancing the specific employment challenges faced by people with disabilities. It takes a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of people with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent Chairperson: Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021.   The CES Phase Three Action Plan will shortly be developed, and the ESRI and OECD reports are both valuable and timely in that context.  Separately, my Department is funding the Employers for Change project which provides support to employers to recruit and retain people with disabilities.  My Department will also bring forward legislative proposals in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill to increase the target for employment of people with disabilities in the public sector from 3% to 6% by 2024. </p></reply>

The White Paper sets out a new Government policy to establish a new International Protection Support Service that I envision will be fully operational by December 2024. This new system will have human rights at its core and will help to ensure that all applicants are treated with dignity and respect. The International Protection Support Service Transition Team of this Department is progressing a detailed implementation plan for the new system and is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the Local Authorities on developing the new Accommodation Model and wrap-around services for residents.</p>  <p>  As we transition to the new system, in order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the short to medium term; as such my Department currently utilises a mixture of state owned, commercial and temporary emergency accommodation centres. </p>  <p>  As for the concerns expressed in the correspondence regarding the welfare of applicants in the current system, there is a clear graduated complaints procedure set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants. Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution. If the resident concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, they may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate. In the event that a resident remains dissatisfied with how their complaint is dealt with, they have full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.?</p>  <p>  To provide further support to all residents, a confidential Freephone telephone support service exists. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). A complaint made to the JRS may be resolved without any IPAS intervention through mediation between the JRS team, the resident and whatever service their complaint relates to. Should a resident desire, a complaint made through this service may also be passed, in confidence, back to IPAS for investigation and resolution. </p>  <p>  In addition to the existing complaints mechanisms available to residents, two new specialist teams were established in IPAS earlier this year to provide a greater focus on the individual needs of residents.  </p>  <p>  A new dedicated IPAS Customer Services Team is working to strengthen the existing resident complaints system and take a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through regular resident feedback clinics.  As well as this increased in-person engagement with residents, the Customer Services Team will also be exploring the use of other feedback mechanisms such as customer focus groups in the months ahead.  </p>  <p>  The IPAS Resident Welfare Team is a new multi-disciplinary team that focuses on residents with more complex issues, including those with physical and mental health issues and persons identified through the IPAS Vulnerability Assessment Process as having special reception needs. Officials from Tusla, the HSE&rsquo;s Social Inclusion Team and the Department of Education support this team. Additional Social Workers are currently being recruited to provide further support to the team.   </p>  <p>  My officials and I take the nutritional needs of residents very seriously. All of my Department&rsquo;s international protection accommodation centres are contractually bound to provide menus that reasonably meet the dietary needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated at the centre. Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements.  All accommodation centres that offer catered options must provide three meals per day and must have a range of snacks and non-alcoholic beverages readily available.</p>  <p>  In addition, contractors must consult with residents and resident committees in the accommodation centres in relation to preferences for inclusion of specific foods on menus or any dietary requirement that they have and where possible this is facilitated. Arrangements are also be made to cater for any particular religious requirements of residents, such as observing Ramadan.</p>  <p>Concerning the conditions in the referenced accommodation centre, every centre is subject to regular unannounced inspections by both my officials in the IPAS and an independent inspectorate company (QTS Limited).  These inspections are undertaken, twice yearly by QTS Limited and once yearly by my officials in IPAS. Inspections cover a wide range of issues including the quality of the food, fire safety and other health and safety issues. The particular centre has been inspected on three occasions since 2019. The reports are available on the gov.ie portal&rsquo;s publications section atwww.gov.ie/en/publication/534c2-ipas-inspection-reports/#monaghan.  HIQA will shortly take on the role of monitoring all centres against national standards.</p>  <p>  Other matters such as the right to work, leave to remain, amnesty for frontline workers and deportation fall under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</p></reply>

The enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 constituted key steps on the pathway to the ratification of the Optional Protocol. </p>  <p>  My Department subsequently made a submission to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office seeking confirmation as to whether Ireland was in a position to ratify the Protocol. The Attorney-General advised that while Ireland is largely compliant with the terms of the Protocol, there are some small outstanding issues that need to be resolved before the Protocol can be ratified. The main outstanding issues, which are within the remit of the Department of Justice, are to determine what, if any, legislative measures may be required to ensure that all of the offences covered by the Protocol can be prosecuted on an organised and transnational basis in line with Article 3.1 of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  There is close engagement between officials in the Department of Justice and my Department while we await their determination of the legislative requirements. Once the Department of Justice has concluded this process, the next step will involve the development of measures that are necessary to enable ratification.  </p>  <p>  My Department co-ordinates the preparation of the next State Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in close collaboration with other Government Departments. The State report responds to the issues raised by the Committee in the List of Issues report which the Committee submitted to the State in November 2020.  The Committee did not raise the issue of the non-ratification of the 2nd Optional Protocol in the List of Issues report.   As a result the draft State Report that is currently available for public consultation does not include a response concerning the Second Optional Protocol. However, it has always been my intention to include an update on the ratification process in the final report to the UN Committee in February 2022. </p></reply>

The Disability Participation and Consultation Network (DPCN) is an important initiative that will help us to realise both the spirit and the substance of the UNCRPD here in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The UNCRPD requires State parties to involve people with disabilities in policy development.  Article 4(3) of the UNCRPD specifically states that "In the development and implementation of legislation and policies to implement the present Convention, and in other decision-making processes concerning issues relating to persons with disabilities, States Parties shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities, through their representative organizations."</p>  <p>  In progressively realising the obligations arising from Article 4(3) of the UNCRPD, my Department funded the development of the DPCN. It was formed in late 2020 to build capacity within the disability community so that people with disabilities and their representative organisations can participate fully in the development of policies and programmes. </p>  <p>  One of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network&rsquo;s first tasks has been to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the Convention.  The Disability Participation and Consultation Network facilitated a consultation process amongst its membership to complete that task and I expect that they will continue to feed into policy-making across Departments. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the DPCN is not the only means by which my Department seeks to fulfil its CPRD obligations. My Department has the coordinating role in respect of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the steering group of which is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D.. Incorporated into this structure is the Disability Stakeholder Group, which provides independent monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy and which is comprised of persons with disabilities, persons with expertise in relation to disability, and persons with lived experience of disability.  My Department explicitly invited applications for persons representing Disabled Persons Organisations in the latest call for expressions of interest to join this Group.</p>  <p>  The contribution of the DPCN and the DSG will be very important in supporting the process of fulfilling Ireland's obligations under UNCRPD.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-12a.1098.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101200077#WRT04200"><p>The Student Grant Scheme is a critical financial support for students participating in further and higher education.  As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine.  For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the reference period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020.   </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020.  This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision.  If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment.  Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. </p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19.  I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Under Article 22(5)(b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, income from an applicant&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period up to a maximum of &euro;4,500 can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed. This holiday earnings disregard under the Student Grant Scheme can only be applied to income from employment earned by the student in the manner described. The holiday earnings disregard pertains specifically to income from employment only; there is no provision to offset this disregard against any other sources of income, such as a social welfare payment.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that restrictions were eased during the summer months and the Christmas period which enabled many students to return to work. Those students, who engaged in work during non-term times when restrictions were eased in 2020, can avail of the holiday earnings provision and have that income excluded from their reckonable income up to the value of &euro;4,500 for the 2021/22 grant scheme. </p></reply>

However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, the awarding authority SUSI has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances, such as serious certified illness, which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams in line with guidelines drawn up by the Minister. </p><p>SUSI treats each application for repeat funding on a case-by-case basis, and it is it is a matter for the individual student to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that there were exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each institution who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed.  Further information on the Fund is available at or from the Access Office of any higher education institution.</p><p>The SAF also assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Student Success is one of the Forum&rsquo;s priority areas, and under this strand a number of projects focusing on universal design for learning have been funded to implement UDL in specific curricula in higher education institutions.  </p><p>The National Forum  have incorporated a strong link to universal design in the new Seven Cs for Embedding Student Success: A Toolkit for Higher Education Institutions, which was launched in recent days.  Full details available at .</p><p>To build staff capacity in UDL, a Digital Badge for UDL has been developed by Ahead and UCD for the National Forum. Last year, 650 participants took part in the Open Course developed through this initiative. The course is currently being delivered with over 1,200 participants from FET and HE.The National Forum is also currently working with UCD and AHEAD on the possible development of another course Universal Design of Student Services with an aim for it to be delivered in Autumn of 2022. A number of professional development seminars on the theme of UDL have also been delivered with support from the National Forum. </p><p>The next National Access Plan is currently in development following an extensive consultation process earlier this year. Inclusivity will be central to this Plan and the application of UDL principles in teaching and learning will be considered within this. </p><p>In further education,  SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), and the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) across the country have progressed a series of actions to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion through the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines to promote inclusion throughout FET. This included the development and publication of a conceptual framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for the FET Sector and a guide on UDL for practitioners. A UDL approach aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners such as their age or the levels of their ability.  This will help all learners in FET, whatever their particular needs, and will make FET as widely accessible as possible  <i>.</i></p></reply>

Students pursuing second degree courses are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants, and therefore graduate entry medicine students have not qualified for these programmes since the introduction of this course.</p><p>In order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). </p><p>Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.

On foot of these commitments approval was given to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. The review is being conducted by external consultants. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. </p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

In practice, this means that only the undergraduate portion of an integrated masters programme would be eligible for free fees funding.  A full tuition fee is payable by all students for any postgraduate/Level 9 award portion of the course of study. Separately, SUSI grant support is available for those students who meet the qualifying criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.  Different supports are available to undergraduate and postgraduate students. Qualifying students attending integrated/intercalated courses, will be initially assessed in respect of the undergraduate portion of the course.  A separate application will be required in respect of the portion of the course deemed to be the postgraduate element.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs.

As part of the overall funding secured for the third level sector to safely reopen in September 2021, an additional &euro;10m is available for the 2021/2022 academic year, providing a doubling of the core Student Assistance Fund bringing the total funding to &euro;17.2m. The Covid Contingency Fund for Access Services of &euro;1.9m has also being continued for a further year. UCC along has been allocated over &euro;1 million from the Student Assistance Fund. The HEA has also been engaging with UCC on this matter and have been assured it is working with students to ensure it is responsive to their needs including establishing their own hardship funding. I spoke with the UCC Student Unions last week too and will meet them again shortly. </p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2022 I am currently giving consideration to the scope, to commence the process of making prioritised improvements to the student grant scheme for the academic year 2022/2023. This would allow early progress in addressing key themes emerging from the Review's consultations and research and recent trends in the cost of living. </p></reply>

The Student Grant Scheme, administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), provides grant assistance to students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The Student Grant Regulations prescribe that an approved course is a full-time course leading to a major higher education and training award which takes a minimum of two years to complete in an approved institution. </p><p>Apart from the student grant scheme the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which is expected to support circa 14,000 students. This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. I have approved the allocation of an additional &euro;8.1m from the Return to Education 2021 funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.  Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p><p>I also approved the continuation of the &euro;1.9m COVID19 Contingency Fund is designed to address the wider needs of vulnerable students and target groups (pre-entry and post-entry) beyond those already catered for though the SAF. </p><p>The student may be eligible for Tax Relief at the standard rate of tax in respect of tuition fees paid for her course. Further information on this tax relief is available from the student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, .</p></reply>

The services that receive funding offer a wide range of support to people who become a victim of crime. Some of these organisations offer support to victims of any type of crime, such as the Crime Victims Helpline or Victim Support at Court, while others provide specialist services for victims of specific types of crime, such as AdViC or Support after Homicide, who work with families who have lost someone close to them as a result of a homicide. </p><p>These services provide important information and support such as emotional support, court accompaniment, and accompaniment to Garda interviews, to sexual assault treatment units and referral to other services. </p><p>While services that provide support of victims of domestic and sexual violence receive funding under the Victims of Crime fund, it is important to state that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency under the aegis of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) and are the primary funders of organisations that deliver frontline services. Tusla is currently undertaking a review of its services. </p><p>In addition, some services for victims of sexual violence, such as Sexual Assault Treatment Units and counselling services fall under the remit of, and are funded by, the Department of Health. </p><p>A list of the organisations in receipt of funding from my Department made available to support victims of crime is set out below.</p><p>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department is currently implementing a program of reform in our criminal justice system to better support vulnerable victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey</i>- our detailed and ambitious plan to implement the recommendations of the O'Malley Review. To date, a number of key actions have been delivered including:</p><p>- Legislating for the introduction of preliminary trial hearings;</p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU);</p><p>- The first cohort of staff at new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles in April;</p><p>- Work to advance the training for all personnel who come into contact with vulnerable victims is underway;</p><p>- Funding for NGOs providing court accompaniment and related information and support services has been increased;</p><p>- A review of grants for organisations supporting victims has been undertaken to identify gaps in service provision;</p><p>- An improved Victims Charter website which provides a comprehensive repository of information for victims has been created;</p><p>- The University of Limerick has been commissioned by my Department to develop the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries and they will soon be engaging with stakeholders to develop this.</p><p>In addition, my Department has undertaken a review of the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services in order to identify where gaps may exist and how to bridge them. Specific geographical areas and categories of victims that are not adequately covered by NGO supports have been identified and my Department is engaging with relevant NGO partners to agree revised funding to ensure that we meet the gaps identified. This piece of work will be completed shortly.</p><p>This work is in addition to the audit of how domestic, sexual and gender-based violence policy and services are organised which was published by my Department in July.  The recommendations of this audit, as well as the Tusla Review and the Supporting a Victim's Journey mapping exercise will play an important role in the development across Government of the Third National Strategy on DSGBV.

Such reports constitute a very important element of the process. </p>  <p>  What exactly good character entails evolves over time, not least to take account of the enactment of new laws. However, in essence it speaks to the need for the applicant to have demonstrated a history of compliance to the laws of the land. The naturalisation application form specifically requires the applicant to list offences, but also provides an opportunity to provide additional details regarding any such offence(s). The mere fact that a person has committed an offence does not automatically result in their refusal. The individual facts of the case are assessed by the case worker and their line management. </p>  <p>  All applicants for a certificate of naturalisation aged 16 years and older are subject to a criminal records check carried out by the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided the following update.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service works closely with County Registrars to support their timely processing of applications. It is also important to recognise the importance of probate being completed in a manner which provides legal certainty for the future.  I am also informed that there would seem to be evidence of difficulties arising where houses are being put on the market without a Grant of Probate having been issued, or in some cases even applied for. This presents additional obstacles to the completion of the transfer of any properties concerned. </p>  <p>  The scheduling of personal application interviews must be conducted in line with public health guidelines. The Courts Service advises that personal applications had to be curtailed in both the Dublin Probate office and District Probate Registries to ensure the safety of both the applicant and staff. However, interviews for personal applications resumed in May. </p>  <p>  Applications by solicitors continued to be processed throughout the period of the pandemic restrictions in both the Dublin Probate Office and the District Probate Registries. The waiting time for solicitor applications at present in the Probate Office, Dublin, is eight to ten weeks assuming that the papers received are correct. Applications where queries had to be raised on foot of the papers first lodged are taking eight weeks from the date they are re-submitted. There are variations in waiting times across all of the other District Probate Registries. </p>  <p>  The staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing any backlogs while the Courts Service is committed to continuing to resource this area of work to minimise waiting times as far as possible. This is one of a range of measures being taken by the Courts Service as part of its ongoing recovery from the pandemic.  The e-probate initiative remains a key objective of the Courts Service Modernisation Programme and reflects the Government&rsquo;s support for the digitisation of the wider justice system.</p></reply>

The capital expenditure ranges across a number of areas such as ICT, Transport investment and capital building and refurbishment works. </p><p>While much of this investment programme is ongoing, it will also encompass new projects over the period of the National Development Plan (NDP) which are at various stages of selection and preparation. </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that three large infrastructural projects provided for in the NDP are due for completion next year, with further information about these projects provided below:</p><p><b>1) Construction of a new forensic science laboratory</b></p><p>-This project will provide Forensic Science Ireland (FSI) with a new modern forensic laboratory in Backweston in Co. Kildare.</p><p>-  The procurement process for a modern laboratory incorporating up to date standards commenced in mid-2019 and concluded in March 2020.  </p><p>-Construction commenced in March 2020 and this project is due for completion in Q3 2022.</p><p><b>2) Redevelopment of Limerick Prison</b></p><p>-This is a project to redevelop and modernise Limerick Prison to include new male accommodation block, female accommodation units together with related rehabilitation and support facilities.</p><p>-The Construction Contract was awarded in February 2019 and the project has been progressed well since then except for the issues arising from COVID-19 lockdowns.  </p><p>-Estimated completion is now Q2 2022 with commissioning of various security/control systems to follow. The estimated delivery date is within Q2/Q3 2022. </p><p><b>3) Construction of a new Garda Control and Operations Centre </b></p><p>-  This is a large capital development for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Military Road Dublin 8 (replacement for the Harcourt Square facilities).</p><p>-Construction commenced in March 2020 and estimated completion is in Q2/Q3 2022. </p><p>In addition to these projects, the capital investment will also allow for increased Investment in modernisation and reform programmes across the Justice sector including increased ICT expenditure in digital services, modernising service delivery, improving efficiency, reducing paper and providing data informed insights into policy development. </p><p>It will also provide for continuing investment in building and refurbishment projects across the Justice sector in new and refurbished Garda stations, court buildings and prisons.  As the Deputy may be aware, construction of a purpose-built Family Law Court complex at Hammond Lane has now been set in train and this project will be delivered by way of PPP and as part of a Justice PPP bundle that will also see the delivery of 2 new Garda stations in Clonmel and Macroom. Allowing for procurement, which would be undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency, planning, and other activities, it is estimated that construction for this project will commence in mid-2023 with completion in late 2025/early 2026.</p><p>Provision is made too for continuing investment in the Garda Transport Fleet including the deployment of electrical vehicles where appropriate to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Courts Service Modernisation Programme is a ten-year initiative extending to 2030 and comprises four delivery phases. The first phase, &ldquo;Mobilise&rdquo;, which focused on setting up the requisite governance mechanisms, initial core-team assembly and awareness building, is now complete and the second phase, &ldquo;Transition&rdquo;, which spans 2021 and 2022, is underway.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the Garda Station Rationalisation Programmes of 2012 and 2013, one hundred and thirty nine (139) Garda Stations were closed nationwide.  This included Kilmihil Garda Station, Co. Clare which was closed in 2013 but was subsequently reopened in 2015 and Lisseycasey Garda Station, Co Clare which was closed in its place.</p><p>Wexford and Kevin Street Garda Stations were also closed, however, they were replaced with new stations.  </p><p>The Programme for Government 2016 contained a commitment to reopen six Garda Stations on a pilot basis.As part of this programme, the Garda authorities idenified Rush Garda Station, Co. Dublin; Stepaside Garda Station, Co. Dublin; Bawnboy Garda Station, Co. Cavan; Donard Garda Station, Co. Wicklow; Leighlinbridge Garda Station, Co. Carlow; and Ballinspittle Garda Station, Co. Cork as the six stations to be reopened.</p><p>To date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with the OPW has successfully completed the refurbishment of four of the six Garda Stations to be reopened i.e. Donard Garda Station, Co. Wicklow; Ballinspittle Garda Station, Co. Cork; Stepaside Garda Station, Co. Dublin; and Rush Garda Station, Co. Dublin. There are two Garda Stations remaining which will require refurbishment in order to enable them to reopen; Bawnboy, Co. Cavan and Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow. </p><p>The table below provides a breakdown of the stations closed by county as a result of the Garda Station Rationalisation Programmes. As noted above, two further stations were closed in the intervening years and replaced with new stations (Kevin St and Wexford). There have been no additional closures. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>2012</th>       <th>2013</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>101</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I understand that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which is within the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, provides a modern and robust framework for dealing with issues relating to animal welfare. I further understand that Local Authorities are responsible under the Act for inspection of the breeding facilities referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  As stated, the main legislative provisions regarding the regulation of these establishments fall under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 (as amended). The Act makes a number of provisions regarding enforcement under Part 8 and Part 9, which provide that the relevant Local Authority or an authorised officer appointed by the Minister for Agriculture in writing is responsible for enforcement of the Act.</p>  <p>  Section 37 of the Act does not automatically confer the powers of an authorised officer on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I have been advised by the Garda authorities that investigations under the Act, therefore, do not fall under An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's remit. Consequently no investigations of the nature specified by the Deputy have been undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time and the examination of an application at the various stages of the process may require additional engagement with applicants and thereby extend the processing time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process.

It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and will radically improve services and supports for victims. The strategy is on track to be developed by my Department in consultation with all relevant Departments and stakeholders with a view to it coming to Government for approval before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has partnered with Safe Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council (NWCI) to provide expert support in developing the new strategy. Among other actions, this includes expert advice on moving to an outcome-focussed framework, the development of a prevention focused strategy, and support for wider public involvement in the consultation phase.  </p>  <p>  The process is being supported by external research consultants who are working on a number of different elements including a review of the second national strategy, identifying the major issues to be addressed and coordinating public input into the new strategy. The public input to date has included -</p>  <p>  - Five geographically focused workshops and 12 thematic workshops (addressing intersectionality and thematic sessions) attended by more than 100 individuals, and</p>  <p>  - An online survey which attracted 109 responses, of which 87 were eligible.  77% of respondents were either victims/survivors of DSGBV or family and/or friends of victims/survivors.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the feedback at these events is currently being examined. </p>  <p>  Interviews with senior decision makers in relevant Departments and agencies have also been undertaken with a view to exploring potential co-design action areas for implementation. </p>  <p>  In line with the cross-Government approach being taken in developing this strategy, Minister Humphreys and I recently wrote to all Ministers asking how they can contribute to the strategy. We have also asked the same of all of the relevant agencies in the justice sector, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to have a draft strategy ready for a further round of public consultation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The then Minister of State received many representations from a range of stakeholders at the time and these were extensively discussed and publicised.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Act modernises the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and will help the better promotion of local gaming and lottery activity held primarily for charitable and philanthropic purposes, and which are an important source of funding to sporting clubs and community organisations across the country.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Act amends the 1956 Act to provide for lotteries promoted under licence for charitable and philanthropic causes only (e.g. sports clubs, community groups, etc.). A licence, once issued by the District Court, remains valid for 12 months and the maximum prize remains at not more than &euro;360,000, if a lottery is held as a once off event in a year. This could apply to situations where sports clubs might raffle high value items, for example, properties. The maximum prize of &euro;360,000 was introduced to give legal certainty to the offering of one single prize.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Act is an interim reform measure pending the comprehensive reform of gambling. </p>  <p>  Work on the General Scheme of the Gambling Bill is at an advanced stage. The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme shortly. There is a clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023.</p>  <p>  While it is possible to amend the threshold by statutory instrument, given the imminence of that legislation, any changes would best be reflected there, as part of the wider reform process.</p>  <p>  The Bill will importantly undergo pre-legislative scrutiny with an opportunity for further stakeholder engagement and input as part of that process. </p></reply>

While Judge White retired from judicial office on 1 October 2021, he has engaged with the work of the Commission since his appointment on 1 July 2021.</p>  <p>  The work of the Commission is at an investigative phase.

The Commission&rsquo;s legal team continues to contact relevant parties and interview witnesses. The Commission has received and reviewed a large volume of disclosure. It has also sought, on an ongoing basis, submissions from interested parties (having regard to its terms of reference) in relation to its ongoing work, including in relation to the scope for and conduct of physical hearings under the public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  Minister Naughton met with the victims and their legal representation in June. Both Minister Naughton and I fully appreciate how important it is that this work progresses. I would continue to urge all victims and survivors to engage with the Commission. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, all Commissions of Investigation are completely independent in their work. As Minister, I cannot intervene in the process, nor direct the Commission in any way.

A submission on the review was received by the then Minister for Justice and Equality from  the Department's Secretary General on 14 May 2018. This submission was subsequently approved by the Minister on 15 May 2019.  It should be noted that the review in question did not ultimately proceed. </p>  <p>  It was intended that the O&rsquo;Farrell family would be sent a copy of the terms of reference for the review, as well as a copy of the Courts Service report which prompted its establishment, following approval of the submission. I acknowledge that there was a significant delay in providing this material to the family. This was not due to any reluctance to share the information, but was rather due to an unacceptable but unintentional and accidental oversight. This oversight only came to light in the course of responding to a Freedom of Information request submitted by the family, and the material was provided to them on 24 February 2020. My Department has expressed its sincere apologies to the O&rsquo;Farrell family for this delay, and I apologise again to them.</p>  <p>  My Department brought the matter referred to in the Courts Service report to the attention of Judge Haughton, who is conducting an independent scoping exercise into matters relating to the death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell.  Judge Haughton agreed to consider the matter as part of his scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Judge is completely independent in conducting this scoping exercise. It is not open to me as Minister to comment on any aspect of the Judge's work or the process of compiling the final report. My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. </p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton recently wrote to my Department seeking comments on one specific section of the draft report. In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on this matter, a response from the Department on the specific section was supplied to Judge Haughton.  Judge Haughton has subsequently been in contact with the Department in the past week to seek feedback on three further sections of his draft report. </p>  <p>  The Department further understands that Judge Haughton has been in touch with the O'Farrell family regarding this matter. Following receipt of responses from all relevant parties, it is understood that Judge Haughton will be in a position to finalise his report. My Department will continue to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge, and I look forward to receiving his final report in due course.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of the final report, the advice of the Attorney General will be sought on publication and any other issues arising.</p></reply>

As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme is to prevent young people between the ages of 12 and 18 years of age from entering into the criminal justice system. Diverting young people from committing further offences is another intended outcome of the Programme. For certain serious crimes, as provided in Section 129(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, young people aged 10 and 11 will be considered for inclusion in the Programme. </p>  <p>  The Garda Youth Diversion Bureau (GYDB) has responsibility for overseeing and developing the Diversion Programme nationally, which was put on a statutory basis under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001. The Bureau is headed by a Chief Superintendent.  </p>  <p>  The remit of the GYDB includes the administration, coordination and development of the Diversion Programme nationally. It holds an oversight position on all aspects of youth referrals and the Programme supports Garda districts and divisions in ensuring effective governance and the timely processing of referrals. </p>  <p>  It also supports a network of Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) Sergeants and JLO Garda&iacute; distributed across every Garda division countrywide. There is an appointed Director of the Diversion Programme at Superintendent rank. The Director&rsquo;s role is provided for under section 20(1) of the Children Act 2001 and is a statutory position. </p>  <p>  When a young person comes to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of their alleged criminal or anti-social behaviour, they are required, under section 18 of the Children Act 2001, to be first considered for the Diversion Programme. In order to be considered for inclusion in the Diversion Programme, the young person must be under 18 years of age, accept responsibility for the offending behaviour, agree to be cautioned and, where appropriate, agree to the terms of supervision. </p>  <p>  The Director&rsquo;s decision on whether or not to admit a young person to the Diversion Programme is based on a number of factors, such as the nature of the offence, the impact of the offence on the community, the views of the victim, and the offending history of the young person. </p>  <p>  If a child is deemed suitable for inclusion in the Diversion Programme, a JLO will be assigned to the child and they will administer a caution to the child. A caution may include a period of supervision where the JLO will continuously monitor the child&rsquo;s progress in line with the plan they have agreed upon to reduce the likelihood of the child re-offending. </p>  <p>  In addition, where other needs are identified, the young person will be referred to a Garda Youth Diversion Project (if one is available in their area) or other clubs or projects in their community. If a child is deemed unsuitable for admission to the Diversion Programme, the Director will issue a signed certificate deeming them unsuitable for this offence. </p>  <p>  Due to the serious nature of the offences queried by the Deputy, and that an alleged offender referred to the Diversion Programme is a minor, I have been advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there is a significant data protection risk involved in releasing the information requested by the Deputy. The release of this information could potentially identify offenders, and importantly, victims of these offences who are afforded anonymity. As the Deputy will appreciate it is not, therefore, possible to provide the information requested. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-12a.1345.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101200081#WRX05400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 and 464 together.</p><p>I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, the combined impact of the 2019 Jones judgment and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the processing timeline for standard applications increasing. </p><p>Aside from these specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with my Department. </p><p>In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>For applicants that were in the final stages of processing, in January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, almost 6,200 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year and a further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Citizenship Division of my Department has prioritised bringing the oldest applications on hand to conclusion and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates since the introduction of the temporary process. </p><p>Since 13 September, citizenship staff have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p><p>The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022.  </p><p>The table below provides the amount received in application fees for Irish citizenship by naturalisation annually since 1 January 2015. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total Application Fees received</th>       <th>Total Certificate fees received</th>       <th>Total Fees</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;2,046,799</td>       <td>9,422,250</td>       <td>&euro;11,469,049</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;2,270,620</td>       <td>7,700,550</td>       <td>&euro;9,971,170</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;2,065,700</td>       <td>6,744,800</td>       <td>&euro;8,810,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;2,048,725</td>       <td>6,765,104</td>       <td>&euro;8,813,829</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;2,316,825</td>       <td>4,754,750</td>       <td>&euro;7,071,575</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;1,241,625</td>       <td>5,577,450</td>       <td>&euro;6,819,075</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021*</td>       <td>&euro;1,350,125</td>       <td>4,840,800</td>       <td>&euro;6,190,925</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* The figures for 2021 are approximate to 07/10/2021. </p><p>In relation to the way these amounts are spent annually, money received goes into central funds so it is not possible to trace a pathway from receipt to expenditure. </p><p>The fees charged in respect of applications for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 and have not increased in the last ten years. The fee is charged in two parts. The current application fee is &euro;175, payable when an application for naturalisation is lodged, in addition to which is a certificate fee, payable when a certificate of naturalisation issues. The standard certificate fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons, there is no certificate fee. </p><p>I am informed that the introduction of the application fee had an immediate positive effect on the quality and completeness of applications, which is ultimately to the benefit of applicants. All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, are kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p><p>The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process. The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies were introduced ten years ago. These have been universally well-received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and a celebratory occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the grant of Irish citizenship. It is my intention that they will resume once it is safe to do so.</p></reply>

The gap between the supply and demand of organs available for transplantation is continually growing due to medical advances and reduced traumatic deaths.  Covid-19 has significantly curtailed transplant activity during 2020 and 2021.  Donations and transplants were impacted by the demands placed on intensive care units, the at-risk status of transplant patients, and the need to redeploy key donation staff to support Covid-19 hospital care in our hospitals.</p>  <p>  Continued investment is required to continue to develop organ donation and transplant services and infrastructure and reduce organ transplant waiting lists.  An additional &euro;1.25m has been provided for organ donation and transplant services since 2020.  Additional funding of &euro;0.5m was provided in 2020, including &euro;0.214m for the purchase of necessary equipment to improve the donation process. A further &euro;0.750m in additional funding was provided in 2021 to further develop organ donation and transplant services.</p>  <p>  The objective of this additional investment is improve organ donation rates, facilitate the move to increase deceased cardiac donations and allow for the expansion of the criteria for acceptable donor donations.  This investment is particularly important to meet the expected additional demands on transplant services following the introduction of the Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination and Public Display) legislation, including the introduction of and opt-out system of organ donation. </p>  <p>The drafting of the Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination and Public Display) Bill is a priority for the Government. My Department is progressing work on the drafting of the Bill in collaboration with the Office of Parliamentary Council with a view to ensuring that Government approval is secured to publish the Bill before the end of 2021.

Over the coming months the Department will be reorganised to meet health system priorities and this will be considered as part of that process. </p>  <p>  In late 2020, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. So, from 01 September 2020, the NRDO became the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO is overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer, where the National Rare Disease Plan is firmly embedded.</p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, took place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  Continuing this practice, earlier this year (2021) I met with the HSE, the NRDO and The Rare Disease Taskforce and a very fruitful discussion was held regarding priority areas for the future in order to build on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of key themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed.</p></reply>

The laboratory is being developed by the HSE and the CWIUH and is designed to be a national centre of excellence for cervical screening. The HSE are also working on recruiting key staff to work in the laboratory now, and in the future.</p>  <p>  The opening of the new NCSL at the CWIUH will build capacity and resilience into the public element of the laboratory services required for the national cervical screening programme in Ireland. The NCSL, acting as the principal provider of laboratory screening services, will enable the National Screening Service to reduce its dependency on third party providers to meet the needs of CervicalCheck. The NCSL will also serve as the national base for training, education and research purposes as relevant to the national cervical screening programme.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific query regarding the number of samples sent abroad - as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy. </p><p>The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s). </p><p>Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for the Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the next few months to finalise this complex legislation. </p><p>Responsibility for maternity leave comes under the remit of the Minister of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and that Department has informed my officials that legislative changes in respect of all forms of family leave must be developed in the context of the legal situation concerning parentage, including in relation to surrogacy. My officials have also been informed that some forms of family leave may currently be available to commissioning parents, including parental leave and parent&rsquo;s leave. However, any further queries relating to maternity leave should be directed to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p><p>The question of whether provision should be made for the retrospective assignment of parentage in respect of children already born through surrogacy arrangements raises complex legal issues which will require detailed examination. </p><p>As Minister for Health, I have no role in the matter of the level of legal costs which may be incurred in relation to the undertaking of an individual surrogacy agreement or any court applications arising from such an arrangement. I am of the view that matters of such importance as the determination of the parentage of a child born through surrogacy should be decided by an appropriate court. </p><p>Issues which arise from the undertaking of surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions raise important questions in respect of rights and ethics, and concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments. This Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of this policy area, including at Ministerial level.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, despite the impact on capacity and activity, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland performed 322 spinal surgeries in 2020 compared with 382 in 2019 and 221 by the end of August in 2021.</p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group. Many elective cases were postponed. Without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.  </p>  <p>  Children's Health Ireland has informed by Department that most systems are back up and running, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street last month, which should enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme. In addition, currently there are additional out-patient clinics and additional theatre sessions being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients. It is envisioned that this should improve access to theatre on Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland base sites for more complex patients awaiting surgery.</p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is continuing to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.  </p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continues to work with the HSE to explore new and innovative ways of working and develop initiatives to support additional orthopaedic and scoliosis activity.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This is being used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE and the NTPF to develop plans to tackle the rise in waiting lists.  The Acute Waiting List Action Plan, which is a short-term plan to address loss of activity arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and ransomware attack was published last week. In addition a longer-term Multi Annual Waiting List Plan is being developed with the objective to bring waiting times in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.</p></reply>

It was chaired by the High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases.</p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the Covid pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established.</p>  <p>  On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board, HRB, carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation, and work to advance policy development in this regard is under way in the Department.</p></reply>

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.</p><p>The issue of menopause has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. Minister Donnelly published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise on September 14th which can be found here:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ebe3e-significant-milestone-as-minister-donnelly-publishes-a-report-of-womens-voices-on-womens-health-following-a-radical-listening-exercise-this-year/</p><p>Minister Donnelly also recently announced his commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland on the 10th of September. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p><p>The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. Further details on this announcement can be found here:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/bf7d4-minister-for-health-announces-a-new-approach-to-menopause-care-for-women-in-ireland/</p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:‎</p> <blockquote> 	GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; a recent ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology Course which includes menopause as a topic. The Minister has outlined his support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This is currently being progressed and will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in General Practice.‎‎‎‎ &bullet; A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause; and<br /><br />The Healthy Workplace Framework is due to be published in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. This has particular reference to increased awareness of menopause within the workplace. </blockquote>  <p>In addition to the activity outlined above, menopause will continue to be a priority for the Women's Health Taskforce for 2021 and 2022. The Government is committed to improving the health experience of women through the menopause.</p></reply>

This is why our Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains strong measures to limit the exposure of our children to alcohol marketing.</p>  <p>  Section 15 and 16 of the Act will come into force on 12 November. These provisions restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship promoting alcohol products, and include a ban on alcohol advertising and sponsorship at events aimed particularly at children or at which the majority of participants or competitors are children. These measures will help to ensure that children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol products and alcohol advertising.</p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Act deals with the content of advertisements for alcohol products. This section cannot be commenced until regulations under it have been made. Draft regulations under section 13 are currently being developed by my Department; upon finalisation they must be submitted to the European Commission for assessment as to whether they are in alignment with Single Market principles.</p>  <p>  Section 19 restricts the hours permitted for advertising alcohol products on television and radio. Further consultation with the Broadcasting Authority and the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment and the HSE is necessary before the section can be commenced. </p></reply>

Furthermore, new products being licenced can fall well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.</p><p>While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan drugs, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs and rare diseases, and this can be observed in the profile of pricing/reimbursement approvals in recent years.</p><p>The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in Budget 2021 has enabled the HSE to approve 43 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines to date this year, as of 7 October. Approximately 15 of these approvals are for the treatment of rare diseases.</p><p>The HSE have provided the following summary in relation to orphan drugs recommendations from July 2016 to May 2021:</p><p>- 34% (46/134) of drugs had orphan designation at the time of Drugs Group review.</p><p>- 78% (36/46) of these orphan-designated drugs received a positive Drugs Group recommendation.</p><p>Therefore, such products continue to be approved for reimbursement when applications are accompanied by robust clinical evidence that an unmet need would be addressed, in accordance with the 2013 Act.</p><p>Any funding allocation for new medicines in 2022 will be considered in the context of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

All expectant mothers who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to avail of services under the scheme. Women who choose to avail of these services are under the care of both a general practitioner of their choice and a hospital obstetrician. Care can be obtained from any general practitioner who has a contract for the provision of services under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides for a number of scheduled visits for which GPs are reimbursed. Care in respect of illnesses which are co-incidental with but not related to pregnancy do not form part of the scheme. Where additional visits are required by patients suffering from major conditions e.g. diabetes, hypertension, a fee of &euro;27.67 per visit, subject to a maximum of 5 visits, will be paid.</p>  <p>  From 1st July 2019, the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme was centralised to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service for online claiming through the GP Application Suite. The new functionality enables GPs to register and submit claims online for expeditious processing. A manual process for claiming is also provided. Details on how to submit claims are outlined in the document entitled &ldquo;HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service Information and Administrative Arrangements for General Practitioners &ndash; V1.0&rdquo; which is available on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Terms of Reference for this Independent Review included consideration of the Pandemic Placement Grant for the academic year 2020/21  as specified in Professor Collins&rsquo; Report.</p>  <p>  The independent review was conducted by Mr Sean McHugh and submitted to me in August 2021. I am currently reviewing Mr McHugh's Report and recommendations, along with my officials. I hope to outline my plans in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  The existing allowances, set out in the 2004 Circular (DOHC Circular 09/2004) were available concurrently to the Pandemic Placement Grant. This Circular provides for student nurses and midwives, attending supernumerary clinical placements, to receive a weekly accommodation allowance, currently of up to &euro;50.79 per week should their placement be away from their normal place of residence. It also entitles students to have travel costs (to supernumerary clinical placements) refunded on the basis of receipts being provided. Payment of these allowances has been continuing during the pandemic and remain available for this academic year</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.</p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period were agreed, with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).</p>  <p>  In late 2020, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. So, from 01 September 2020, the NRDO became the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO is overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer, where the National Rare Disease Plan is firmly embedded.</p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, took place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  Continuing this practice, earlier this year (2021) I met with the HSE, The NRDO and The Rare Disease Taskforce and a very fruitful discussion was held regarding priority areas for the future in order to build on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of key themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed.</p></reply>

This will be a key building block for the government&rsquo;s plans for the delivery of health services and supports into the future.  A key finding of the review is that an average of 90 new residential places will be needed every year from 2020 to 2032 to cater for changes in the size and age structure of the disability population.   </p>  <p>  It is one of the many cross governmental plans needed to support people with a disability living their lives to the fullest and in the way they want to. It&rsquo;s important we continue all the good work already underway to reframe our disability services around individuals&rsquo; hopes and needs, delivering genuinely person-centred services. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out an ambitious agenda for the provision of disability services. In Budget 2021, the Government allocated over &euro;2.2 billion for specialist disability services, including &euro;100m in additional funding to enhance services and supports, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area.  An additional 102 new residential places are being provided for in 2021 based on priority need.  </p>  <p>  The provision of the additional residential places is one of many measures that Government supports for people with disabilities.  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2022, and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, is being considered as part of the national budgetary process and HSE National Service Planning.</p></reply>

Approximately 1,200 contracted dentists provide oral healthcare to medical card holders under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS). From March 2020 until mid-August 2021, approximately 250 dentists left the Scheme. The HSE advise that dentists have been leaving the Scheme for a range of reasons and that dentists are also applying to join the Scheme. The HSE will assist anyone experiencing problems accessing a service.</p>  <p>  The approach to future oral health service provision will be aligned with Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy (2019). The aim of the policy is to develop a model of care that will enable preventative approaches to be prioritised, improve access, and support interventions appropriate to current and future oral health needs.</p>  <p>  The current DTSS is based on outdated approaches from the 1990s and is no longer suitable. I am committed to ensuring the sustainability of the DTSS, but recognise that it needs to be aligned  with the best international evidence and practice, as outlined in the new Policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the roll-out of the National Oral Health Policy to be delayed, and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. Officials in my Department and from the HSE are currently engaging with the Irish Dental Association on matters relating to the provision of services under the DTSS.</p></reply>

The existing scheme, the Reconstitution Ash Dieback Scheme closed to new applications from 12<sup>th</sup>April 2018.  </p><p>At the same time, the Department began a review of the national response to Ash Dieback Disease as it was increasingly evident from experience and the latest scientific advice that eradication of Ash Dieback disease was no longer feasible.  </p><p>Pending completion of the review, the Department moved away from a mandatory sanitation requirement approach while continuing annual premium payments to affected forest owners.  While the main scheme was closed to new applications, Circular 6 of 2018 advised that any applications received after the date of the circular would be brought forward to the new scheme.  The Woodland Improvement Scheme (WIS) also remained available to plantation owners.</p><p>The focus of the review was on the policy approach and associated support schemes, considering the move away from Ash Dieback eradication and bringing ash plantation management into focus. The review included further consideration of damage level evaluation together with inclusion of a broader range of silvicultural and management options. This new approach was circulated for stakeholder consultation in December 2019 and a total of 18 submissions were received in reply.</p><p>All submissions were carefully considered, and meetings held with stakeholders to finalise a revised scheme document.  The Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash Dieback) was announced on the 10th June 2020 and applications could be submitted from the 22nd June 2020.</p><p>The objectives of the scheme are to encourage the active management of ash plantations, to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning and, where appropriate in young plantations and in cases of high disease infection, to support the removal of the affected ash crop and replacement with alternative species.  </p><p>The Scheme also aims to build resilience and diversity into plantations and possibly identify tolerant or resistant individuals.  The scheme provides a suite of options that will give owners the opportunity to recover the maximum economic value possible from their affected ash plantations. </p><p>Last June, the Department carried out an assessment of the response to the Scheme. One question that had arisen is the availability of management options for plantations greater than 25 years of age.  </p><p>After careful consideration I revised these management options and would like to note, all ash plantations which exceed 7m top height with a medium level of stem infection are now eligible for under-planting and with high level stem infection are now eligible for reconstitution.  This change brings sites over 25 year of age into the Scheme.</p><p>To date (1<sup>st</sup>October), the Department has received 386 applications for 1,557.85ha, of which decisions have issued on 125 apps for 431.57ha. </p></reply>

These objectives will be aided by the EU Common Agricultural and Common Fisheries Policies operating after 2020 which are expected to focus on these sectors in a way that delivers enhanced economic, environmental and social  sustainability, with a particular emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.</p></reply>

This provides a framework within which private sector businesses can explore business opportunities in China. The extent and scope of any trade is a matter for private enterprise, subject to compliance with animal health and animal welfare standards and the conditions of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  Any live animals transported from Ireland are governed under the requirements of EU legislation. The vast majority of animals exported from Ireland travel to the EU, which is governed by the same animal welfare legislation as Ireland. A relatively small percentage are exported to non-EU countries - the transport of these animals are subject to the same to EU legislation. </p>  <p>  The Department, in cooperation with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. The OIE is the global standard setting body relating to animal health and animal welfare. It is through this forum that we influence standards in other non-EU countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a member of the OIE European Platform Steering Committee on Animal Welfare since its creation in 2013 and has offered technical inputs for the development of the OIE Platform action plans. To support these activities, Ireland has also provided financial supports in recent years. </p>  <p>  All live export shipments from Ireland are conducted in full compliance with legislative requirements. All proposed journeys must be notified to the Regional Veterinary Office in advance, and veterinary certification will only be provided where the journey complies with all animal transport and animal welfare regulations. This includes a requirement to notify the Regional Veterinary Office of the outcome of each journey once completed, and the condition of the animals on arrival. The export and the transport of animals from Ireland is continuously monitored.</p>  <p>  Live exports play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this commercial trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p></reply>

Every tree felling licence carries an obligation to replant the felled area.  </p>  <p>  A landowner wishing to convert afforested land (regardless of whether the trees were planted under a Forestry Scheme), may propose an alternative area of the same size.  This alternative area must receive approval to plant, without grant aid, prior to the granting of any tree felling licence.</p>  <p>  Forestry is a permanent land use change, and therefore there are no grants to convert afforested land into another agricultural use.  The realisation of the timber asset once harvested is considered more than adequate to cover the cost of replanting.  </p>  <p>  When a site is felled, it will be closely monitored to ensure it is replanted.  The Forestry Act 2014 sets out the legislation governing the felling of trees, the licences required, offences and penalties for breaches of the legislation. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy to prevent deforestation, which is the permanent removal of forests.  Reforestation after felling is essential to prevent deforestation, which would otherwise counteract the social, environmental and economic benefits of Ireland's afforestation programme and devalue the associated public expenditure on afforestation.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Felling and Reforestation Policy&rdquo; document aims to provide a consolidated source of information on the legal and regulatory framework relating to tree felling.  </p></reply>

EU Directives declare that there can be legitimate reasons for awarding contracts non-competitively, such as extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events or if there is a single supplier to perform the contract.  Therefore, a non-competitive procurement is not necessarily non-compliant with procurement rules.</p><p>Circular 40/02 issued by the Department of Finance requires my Department to report all contracts above &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) awarded without a competitive process to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) by 31 March of the following year. </p><p>In 2020, 81 contracts with a value of &euro;11,774,607.18 were awarded without a competitive process and declared on the Circular 40/02 return as expenditure against those contracts exceeded the reporting threshold of &euro;25,000. </p><p>Of this, contracts valued at &euro;8,327,906.39 were undertaken without a competitive process but are considered compliant, as the justification for awarding these contracts without a competitive process falls within the exceptions to open/competitive procurement permitted in national and EU legislation. </p><p>The remaining procurements with a value of &euro;3,446,700.79 were also undertaken without a competitive process but not considered compliant as the contracts were not subject to an independent review prior to the award of the contract.  Details of the 2020 40/02 return are below.</p><p>My Department is committed to reducing the level of non-compliant procurement undertaken.  The Central Procurement Unit, supports Divisions undertaking procurements through the dissemination of key policy information, advice and support in the preparation of tenders and other procurement related matters.  Through direct engagement across the Department, the Unit has sought to ensure best practice at an operational level so that effective value for money is achieved in a compliant manner.  Since 2017, the Department has reduced the level of non-competitive procurement significantly.</p><p>Information on any instances of non-compliant procurement that arise in 2021 will be available in my Department's 2021 Appropriation Account which will be published by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2022.</p><p>Value of contracts appearing on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's 2020 Circular 40/02 return by category  <table>    <tr>       <th>Subject of Contract / Purchase</th>       <th>Ex VAT Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ICT Software/ Licences</td>       <td>&euro;1,477,575.41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laboratory Supplies </td>       <td>&euro;2,158,235.57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lab Equipment &ndash; Purchases, Maintenance, Support </td>       <td>&euro;335,050.75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IT Hardware/Maintenance</td>       <td>&euro;175,972.38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Handheld Scanners</td>       <td>&euro;27,614.78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laboratory Testing</td>       <td>&euro;68,524.47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Haulage</td>       <td>&euro;54,786.20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rendering and Biological   Waste Disposal</td>       <td>&euro;5,053,465.41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Disposal of Carcass Waste</td>       <td>&euro;26,442.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Relief Services</td>       <td>&euro;38,604.26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Franking and Mailroom   Services</td>       <td>&euro;97,645.78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Security Printing</td>       <td>&euro;55,722.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>File Storage</td>       <td>&euro;377,616.93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Facilities Management</td>       <td>&euro;189,831.74</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Office Supplies</td>       <td>&euro;104,178.93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Supplies</td>       <td>&euro;26,812.04</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Works: Consultancy</td>       <td>&euro;31,564.70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Forestry Consultancy</td>       <td>&euro;70,298.60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Works: Consultancy</td>       <td>&euro;76,633.17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Works: Marine Contractor</td>       <td>&euro;303,011.92</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Consultancy Services   (Ecologist)</td>       <td>&euro;53,154.75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Beef Carcase Classification</td>       <td>&euro;25,833.20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Certification Services</td>       <td>&euro;33,733.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wastewater Treatment</td>       <td>&euro;34,092.24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Veterinary Services</td>       <td>&euro;26,942.28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Telephony Services</td>       <td>&euro;685,672.79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Strategic Assessment   (Agri-Food 2030 Strategy)</td>       <td>&euro;28,141.09</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Macerator Rental</td>       <td>&euro;49,258.58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Forestry Mapping Hardware   &amp;amp; Software</td>       <td>&euro;44,952.21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IT Contractors</td>       <td>&euro;43,240.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall as a result of disturbance to the market. </p><p>One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021, as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019. </p><p>I engaged with the  EU Commission to seek flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction. I succeed in introducing an option on agfood.ie on 19th March 2021 to choose an alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021.  In that period, just over 16,000 opted for the later reduction period. </p><p>When the original reduction period ended on 30th June 2021, it was identified that approximately 5,300 of the approximately 16,000 BEAM participants who had opted to defer had in fact met all their BEAM commitments including the 5% bovine nitrates reduction. The Department therefore removed them from the later reduction period.</p><p>This leaves approximately 10,700 BEAM participants in the later reduction period. These participants will continue to receive a monthly letter from my Department (as all participants have done since February 2021) outlining the amount of nitrates they have already used (accumulated), the amount of nitrates they have left to ensure they meet the 5% reduction and a projection based on the livestock numbers on their holding of their final nitrates position at the end of the reduction period. </p><p>The most recent analysis by theDepartment suggests;</p><p>a. Approximately <b>1,700 participants are on track</b>to meet the BEAM 5% bovine nitrates reduction requirement,</p><p>b. A further <b>300 </b>are on course to deliver a nitrates reduction of between 4% and 5%, Part of the payment will be recouped from them.</p><p>c. Approximately <b>8,600 </b>are currently predicted to miss the minimum 4% reduction and are therefore facing full recoupment of their BEAM payment.</p><p>d. Within that 8,600, in approximately <b>7,400</b>of the herds, the bovine nitrates have <b><i>increased</i></b>over the reduction period compared to the reference period,</p><p>e. Within the number of 7,400 herds, approx. <b>1,110 </b>have already registered nitrates in excess of their target total.  </p><p>The average payment for those BEAM participants who opted to defer is just less than &euro;2,500. </p><p>The Department will continue, as it has been doing, to provide relevant information and updates to participants, but I would encourage all participants to take timely action to ensure they meet the commitments they signed up to in the Terms and Conditions of the scheme back in 2019.</p></reply>

Donegal. In addition, the Department provides funding to Teagasc who carry out a very successful potato breeding programme. </p>  <p>  As a further support my Department has a nationwide seed certification team in place to ensure the production of high-grade seed with the capability to deliver on additional acreage and laboratory capacity, if required. The Certification Scheme includes soil and tuber sampling and testing for pest and disease control. This high-quality disease-free seed is made available to the industry for further multiplication and supply to commercial growers and for export.</p>  <p>  The Department also participates in the Potato Development Group, which has representation from Bord Bia, Teagasc and the IFA and is actively investigating future markets for Irish potatoes.</p>  <p>  Following the end of the Brexit transition period on 1st January 2021 and the departure of the UK from the EU, Ireland is the only EU Member State designated a high health status under EU legislation for the growing of seed potatoes. Also, with the UK&rsquo;s new status as a &lsquo;Third Country&rsquo; the import of seed potatoes is currently prohibited.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges, I am firmly of the view that there is significant potential to increase the production and supply of Irish grown seed potatoes. I am committed to further developing this sector.</p>  <p>  This potential can only be achieved through close collaboration and full buy-in within the sector. I consider an industry led approach, supported by DAFM, will be the most viable sustainable approach.   </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s Eco-Scheme is proposed to have five actions; participating farmers will complete two actions in any given year. One of these actions is proposed to plant a number of tress per hectare.  The Eco-Scheme will aim to engage as many farmers as possible and as such this tree planting action will encourage farmers to plant significant numbers of trees given the land area that will hopefully be entered into the scheme.</p>  <p>  AECM will be a multi-annual scheme where farmers will have the option to plant trees and/or hedges.  Farmers will have the option to select actions based around planting trees in rows, groups or parkland.  In addition, farmers are also proposed to be offered actions relating to planting trees in riparian buffer strips as well as potentially planting tree belts adjacent to farmyards with a view to capturing ammonia.</p>  <p>  To facilitate greater integration of small areas of woodland planting on farms under CAP, the  Department is also exploring the potential to amend the Forestry Act.</p>  <p>  These will complement the Department's Forestry programme which will continue to be funded nationally. </p></reply>

To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021.</p><p>It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, chaired by my Department, published its first Interim Report in July and the Project Manager has published the Project Charter which details project management oversight.</p><p>As part of Project Woodland, we are about the select a preferred bidder with legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.</p><p>The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.</p><p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25<sup>th </sup>June by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues. However, in September licences exceeded expected levels with a total of 585 licences issued. This means that September will be the highest month this year for new licences. We anticipate that we will maintain expected levels of output to the end of the year.</p><p>Along Minister of State Hackett, we recognise that the delivery of afforestation licences needs to improve.  We are now putting in place a dedicated team of 10 ecologists who will deal solely with these licences for the foreseeable future.  This will increase output over the coming weeks.  Productivity will depend on the quality of the information provided (that is, NISs, ecology reports, prescreening reports, and habitat maps) provided. </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p><p>The Department publishes a range of forestry licence statistics on the Forestry pages of its website at gov.ie.

They provide a safe, comfortable and inclusive environment where people of all ages can share skills and work on meaningful projects and connect with their communities. </p><p>My Department is providing a range of supports which both Men's and Women&rsquo;s Sheds can avail of, depending on the works being completed.</p><p>In 2018<b></b>the <b>Community Enhancement Programme (CEP)</b>provided capital funding for community groups which included &euro;0.5m that was ring-fenced for Men's Sheds and again in 2019, &euro;0.5m was ring-fenced under the programme for both Men's &amp;amp; Women's Sheds.  Typical uses for this capital funding was the purchase of equipment, and small repairs or renovations. </p><p>In 2020, the <b>CEP</b>received total funding of &euro;7.2m, including &euro;5m under the Government's July stimulus package for repairs or upgrades to community centres and community buildings.  Many shed groups received capital funding under this programme including for example 11 shed groups in Co. Clare.  </p><p>In May this year, I launched the <b>2021 Community Enhancement Programme</b>with funding of &euro;4.5m.  This programme provides small capital grants to community groups to enhance their facilities and towards the reopening of facilities.  Men's &amp;amp; Women's sheds along with other community groups could apply to this funding programme.  My Department is collating this data at present but I understand a number of Shed groups have been approved funding from the 2021 CEP.</p><p>The <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) </b>has provided supports to over 200 Men&rsquo;s Sheds since 2018, with small grants totaling over &euro;98,000 awarded to 116 Men&rsquo;s Sheds.This support, usually in the form of training and capacity building, will continue to be available throughout the current iteration of SICAP which runs until 2023.  </p><p>The <b>Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO)</b>provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, community and voluntary organisations.  The current scheme runs from 1st July 2019 to 30th June 2022. The <b>Irish Men&rsquo;s Sheds Association</b>was allocated <b>&euro;270,000</b>over the three year period of the scheme. </p><p>My Department also funded the national organisation, the <b>Irish Men&rsquo;s Sheds Association</b>under the <b>Stability Fund</b>in 2020, with <b>&euro;70,424</b>in current funding to support the organisation to continue to deliver services despite the challenges brought by COVID-19. </p><p>In order to provide all the detail regarding grants to individual sheds, my Department is currently collating the information and will arrange for it to be forwarded directly to the Deputy when that process is complete.</p></reply>
