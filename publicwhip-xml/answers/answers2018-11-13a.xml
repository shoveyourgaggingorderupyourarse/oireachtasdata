The changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or individuals who needed increased levels of care.  The new HomeCaring periods recognised under the system are expected to significantly assist many people as it is not restricted to post 1994 periods of care, unlike the existing Homemakers scheme. </p><p>The changes apply to those who reached pension age on or after 1<sup>st</sup>September 2012 who were awarded less than maximum rate, on post Budget 2012 rate bands.  </p><p>Currently there are approximately 79,000 pensioners in this category and my Department is now in the process of issuing Information Letters to each of them.</p><p>Work on examination of the social insurance records of the pensioners concerned commenced in September.  As social insurance records are unique to individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  To date, over sixty temporary staff members have been recruited to work on this phase.  Further recruitment will take place in January  2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way and it is anticipated that the first review outcomes will be notified to pensioners during Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>Payment of increases, where awarded, will be made immediately after an individual's review is completed.  If a pensioner does not qualify for an increased rate, they will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment, made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that they require that level of care.  </p>  <p>  The target processing time for the scheme is to finalise 70% of new claims within 12 weeks.  Currently the average time taken to process new applications is 17 weeks. </p>  <p>  The principal reason for the length of time taken to process a Carer's Allowance claim is the growth in recent years in the number of applications received; these increased by 31% between 2015 and 2017.  </p>  <p>  It is also the case that social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  </p>  <p>  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to Carer's Allowance, evidence must be provided in respect of the carer&rsquo;s habitual residence in the State, the level of care they provide, their means and also that the person being cared for has such a disability that they require full-time care and attention.  It is sometimes the case that the documentary evidence provided at initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient and this can contribute to the time taken to process applications. </p>  <p>  The Department recently launched a re-designed Carer's Allowance application form which includes a new Care Report section which has been arrived at through consultation between officials and medical assessors of my Department and representatives and members of Family Carers Ireland.  This new form allows carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  </p>  <p>  Also, additional staff have also recently been reassigned to the Carer's Allowance area to work on claims processing and this should lead to a reduction in both processing times and in the time taken to implement Appeals Officers' decisions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This transfer had a number of objectives including: </p><p>Moving the illness benefit payments off an old IT platform which is approaching end of life to a newer IT platform which is already managing most of my Department&rsquo;s other payments. </p><p>Realising cost savings by eliminating the need for labour intensive data entry and enabling the re-use of existing data already on the Business Objects platform. </p><p>Facilitating, in due course, the move from submission of paper medical certificates by people to one whereby an e-certificate is transmitted electronically from the GP to my Department. </p><p>Facilitating, also in due course, the move away from certification each week by a GP to a system where a single certificate is provided to cover the entire illness period. </p><p>The system change has worked effectively for about 80% of people who claim illness benefit but a number of significant difficulties arose which affected payments. </p><p><b>The Split-Payment Issue </b></p><p>The redesign of the medical certificate enabled the forms to be scanned rather than manually entered into the system.  However, approximately 50% of GP practices initially continued to submit &lsquo;old&rsquo; form medical certificates.  This led to long delays in claim processing on the new system in early August. </p><p>These delays were overcome by my Department implementing an &lsquo;automatic certification&rsquo; process to ensure that people, including those whose GPs were not submitting the correct certificates, got paid.  </p><p>While this process did ensure that people received their payments it did result in approximately 15% of recipients receiving a split payment in the period from September to November.  People who received split payments were not underpaid as a consequence of this approach; the total amount paid was in accordance with their entitlement. </p><p>During this time, my Department also deployed additional staff to process old form certificates received from GP practices.  This allowed us to cease the auto-certification process in mid-October and the issue of split payments has since been largely resolved.  Approximately 75% of medical certificates now being received are in the correct format.  The remaining forms are being processed manually on the day they are received. </p><p><b>Payment Gaps/Missed Payments </b></p><p>The removal of the auto-certification process has belatedly exposed some underlying deficiencies in the design and operation of the new illness benefit system. </p><p>The main issue identified relates to the transition from a payment-in-arrears approach to a current-week payment approach, i.e. from a system whereby people are paid their entitlement the week after a period of certification, to one where they are paid during the week of certification.  This leaves very little tolerance for late receipt of certificates once a claim is in payment.  This is causing significant uncertainty for people. </p><p>The new system also has very tightly defined rules which must be satisfied before a claim and a certificate can be accepted and processed.  Although these rules are valid in principle, they are leading to payments being delayed for reasons that would not have been applied under the legacy system. </p><p><b>Measures Taken to Address The Payment Issues </b></p><p>My Department is taking three main steps to resolve the issues just described. </p><p>First we have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to enquiries arising from the tight application of scheme rules by the new system. </p><p>Second, we have developed some new IT routines or &lsquo;workarounds&rsquo; that in effect build in a seven day buffer to address the payment gap issue and automate the processing of tasks to ensure a faster flow-through to payments. </p><p>Third we are reviewing the design rules in the system, including the payment in the current week rule, and will modify the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates. </p><p>In addition, my Department continues to engage with the medical profession regarding the implementation of e-certification and single / closed certification.  These measures will, in time, lead to better service for people. </p><p>My Department has also allocated additional managers to take responsibility for the programme of work just set out.  This management team includes a full time assistant secretary and additional staff at Principal, Assistant Principal and Higher Executive Officer level. </p><p>As a consequence of the measures just described, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order should now receive their payment entitlement.  Payment volumes were restored to normal levels last week and are being monitored on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at this level.  Any further issues that may arise will be quickly identified and any further remedial action that may be required will be taken. </p><p>In stating this it is important to note there are always cases, and were always such cases under the old system, where people&rsquo;s payments are legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons.  These types of issues will always remain and would normally be dealt with via our helpline number. </p><p><b>Other Issues/Measures </b></p><p>In addition to these system issues, my Department acknowledges that it did not communicate effectively with people in advance of the new system coming into effect, nor in the immediate post implementation period.  While my Secretary General did write to all people in receipt of illness benefit some weeks ago to apologise for the difficulties and to advise of other supports available this communication was, I accept, too little, too late and was of limited comfort to those people affected. </p><p>Our experience with the illness benefit transfer has been a salutary reminder that the longer term impact of short-term remedial actions, taken with the best intentions when unanticipated issues arise or failures occur, must be carefully thought through before implementation. </p><p>In order to ensure that lessons are identified and learned from this experience, my Secretary General has commissioned an independent review of this project to be undertaken by a retired Revenue Commissioner.  It is expected that it will be delivered by the end of the year and its findings will inform our approach to future system and process changes. </p><p><b>Conclusion </b></p><p>As I have already said my Department sincerely regrets and is deeply embarrassed by the difficulties recently encountered by people in receipt of illness benefit. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-13a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300065#WRB02100"><p>The Christmas Bonus is paid to long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and long term unemployed people, who rely either wholly or mainly on their social welfare payments for financial support.  The payment will benefit more than 1.2 million social welfare recipients this year.  The Working Family Payment (WFP) is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees with children.  The Working Family Payment is therefore a supplementary payment rather than a main source of income.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  According to Eurostat Data, the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland is less than half the EU average and this is, in large part, due to in-work supports such as the WFP and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  An integral part of the WFP scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the WFP scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  The average weekly payment across all families is currently in the region of &euro;135 per week.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 54,000 families with almost 122,000 children in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP for 2018 is approximately &euro;431 million, following the increase in the thresholds provided for in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  WFP recipients have not been eligible for the bonus in the past and any changes to the qualifying criteria for the Christmas Bonus would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

Responsibility for this legislation lies with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with that Act, a foreign divorce will be recognised in this State, if one of the parties to the divorce was domiciled in the country granting the divorce when those divorce proceedings were initiated.  If neither party was domiciled in the country granting the divorce when the proceedings were initiated, the foreign divorce cannot be recognised here.  </p>  <p>  Where the foreign divorce is not recognised, any subsequent marriage cannot be recognised.  In such a case a person cannot be deemed, under Irish State Law, to be the legal widow(er) of the deceased.  Consequently, where the subsequent marriage cannot be recognised, there is no entitlement to widow(er)&rsquo;s contributory pension.  In this regard, the Registrar General is the statutory officer responsible for the system of marriage registration in the State. </p>  <p>  In determining domicile for social welfare purposes, an applicant is afforded the opportunity to make available to my Department any evidence that either party to the divorce was domiciled in the state granting the divorce at the time the divorce proceedings were initiated.   </p>  <p>  Under the Family Law Act 1995 a person can apply to the Family Law Court to have a declaration made as to whether a divorce obtained in another country is recognised in this State.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Both Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance claim processing times are within their respective targets.  In October 2018 the average time taken to process new Disability Allowance applications was 11 weeks and the average time taken to process new Domiciliary Care Allowance applications was 10 weeks. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance claim processing is currently outside the scheme target, which is that 70% of claims should be processed within 12 weeks.  In October 2018, the average time taken to process new Carer's Allowance applications is 17 weeks. </p>  <p>  In general, social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to Carer's Allowance, evidence must be provided in respect of the carer&rsquo;s habitual residence in the State, the level of care they provide, their means and also that the person being cared for has such a disability that they require full-time care and attention.  It is sometimes the case that the documentary evidence provided at initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient and this can contribute to the time taken to process applications. </p>  <p>  The Department recently launched a re-designed Carer's Allowance application form which includes a new Care Report section which has been arrived at through consultation between officials and medical assessors of my Department and representatives and members of Family Carers Ireland.  This new form allows carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  </p>  <p>  Also, additional staff have also recently been reassigned to the Carer's Allowance area to work on claims processing and this should lead to a reduction in processing times in that area.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Two cases were deemed by the inspector to be correctly classed as self-employed and formal decisions did not issue.  Nine cases are still under investigation.  One individual did not wish to pursue the case.  </p><p>Given the relatively low number of formal requests for determinations, there may be some reluctance by individuals to seek a Scope determination due to concerns over how an employer will react.  This suggests that the most appropriate way to address the issue will be through inspection and that anti-victimisation measures may be required to provide assurance to workers that they cannot be victimised if they raise legitimate concerns regarding their employment status.</p><p>Although the response was low the response to the campaign will inform the inspection work of DEASP, Revenue and WRC, including in sectors other than construction.  The Department has intensified its employer inspection activity since the campaign.  A separate series of investigations took place in the west of the country focussed on the construction sector.  Two further projects with a particular emphasis on identifying false self employment are currently planned for the Dublin North and Mid West Divisions.</p><p>In considering whether new measures may be required to tackle an issue such as false self-employment account needs to be taken of the available data and evidence as to the prevalence and impact of the issue.  It should also be considered if there are existing measures already available in legislation which can be applied to address the issue.</p><p>There are already significant legislative powers to investigate and sanction employers and employees who falsely declare their social insurance status as self-employed rather than employed.</p><p>On balance the Department's view is that, with the possible exception of anti-victimisation protections, there are already sufficient legislative provisions and powers to enable the State (and in particular the Department) to identify, investigate and enforce, including through criminal prosecutions where necessary, the false declaration of employment as self-employment.  </p><p>Turning to the related matter of employment rights, there was a commitment in the Programme for Government to address the perceived increase in the casualisation of work and strengthen the regulation of precarious employment.  The Employment Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2017, currently going through the Oireachtas, addresses a number of workers&rsquo; rights issues, including:</p><p>- prohibiting zero hour contracts in most circumstances;</p><p>- the requirement that the terms of employments be produced by the employer within five days;</p><p>- new minimum payment for employees called in to work but sent home again without work;</p><p>- a new right for employees whose contract of employment does not reflect the reality of the hours they habitually work to be placed in a band of hours that better reflects the hours they have worked over a reference period;</p><p>- strong anti-penalisation provisions.</p><p>With reference to compliance with sectoral or industry employment orders (REAs), these orders are an integral part of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery and are made under industrial relations legislation.  Compliance with such orders comes within the statutory functions of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  Both the WRC and industrial relations legislation and policy are a matter for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p><p>Bogus self-employment is consistently brought up by Deputies as a prevalent issue.  If any Deputy is aware of any such cases, I strongly urge them to bring these to my attention so that my Department can investigate.</p></reply>

This issue was, in fact, one of the matters the consultation sought opinions on, and those opinions will inform the final design of that scheme.</p>  <p>  The consultation process on the proposed reforms which dates back to October 2007 was extensive and included the then Government publishing the Green Paper on Pensions, conducting regional seminars, a national conference, and consultation meetings with sectoral interests as well as the written submissions.</p>  <p>  The Framework model arising from that did propose a 30 year requirement for a maximum rate pension under a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) from 2020, but it also had less generous HomeCaring provisions, which would have seen that reform significantly disadvantage many women who had spent time outside the labour market raising their children.  I believe that this would be unfair, given legacy issues around the marriage bar and the availability of childcare.</p>  <p>  I launched the public consultation on the design of the TCA on the 28th of May to which stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  Members of the media were also there and the consultation was featured extensively on broadcast and written media.</p>  <p>  All Oireachtas members were also invited to a briefing in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and we received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents upon a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government in due course, and the scheme will be introduced through the standard democratic process, and the policy choices will, I believe, be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.    I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The recent ESRI report &ldquo;<i>The Gender Impact of Irish Budgetary Policy&rdquo; </i>is a valuable contribution which will further inform this process.</p><p>In terms of the findings, the report is based on two research assumptions: one where couples&rsquo; incomes are shared and the other where their income is treated separately.  It is under the latter assumption that women who are not in paid work were found to have lost more than men who were not in paid work.  The report states that this was mainly due to changes in the child benefit payment during the recession and the initial post-recession period.  However, the report noted that this assumption (that couples do not share income) is somewhat extreme as it is more likely that couples do share a large proportion of their income.</p><p>The report also noted that there were no differences in terms of gains or losses to disposable income for single men and women or men and women in couples without children.  Men and women in couples with children were also found to experience the same gains and losses, assuming that they shared their income.</p><p>The report notes that the main causes of the different gender impacts of budgetary policy are based on the economic activity of the individual and the presence of children.  Therefore, the gender differences over the period in question were more likely to have arisen due to the fact that women are more likely than men to be lone parents, to be economically inactive and to benefit more from child-related supports.</p><p>In recent years, with the improvement in the fiscal situation, the Government has been in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  This includes a package of measures to support lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education and helping to reduce their childcare costs. </p><p>Most recently Budget 2019 included measures specifically targeting families, including lone parent families.  These included a &euro;5 weekly increase to working age payments, including the One Parent Family payment and the Jobseekers Transition payment; increases to the qualified child allowance of &euro;2.20 per week for children under 12 years of age and &euro;5 per week for children over 12; additional increases to the earnings disregard for the One Parent Family payment and the Jobseekers transition payment (to &euro;150 per week); an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for both primary and secondary school children and an increase in the Christmas Bonus to 100%.</p><p>My Department is currently preparing the annual Social Impact Assessment on the range of tax and welfare measures included in Budget 2019.  It is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of policies on household incomes, families, poverty and access to employment.  This year, it will also include gender analysis. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Although the system change has worked effectively for over 80% of IB customers, significant difficulties arose following implementation for a number of customers. </p>  <p>  My Department is taking three main steps to resolve the issues impacting on payments.  First, we have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to the customer enquiries.  Second, we have developed some new IT routines or &lsquo;workarounds&rsquo; that address the payment gap issues and to ensure a faster flow-through to payments.  Third, we are reviewing the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of the steps just described people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order should now receive their payment entitlement.  I can advise that payment volumes were restored to normal levels over the past two weeks and my officials are monitoring them on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at this level.  Any further issues that may arise will be dealt with as they are identified.  In addition to these system issues, the Department acknowledges that it did not communicate effectively with customers.  </p>  <p>  In stating this it is important to note that there are always cases, and were always such cases under the old system, where people's payments are legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons.  These type of issues will always remain and are normally dealt with via our helpline number.  Given high call volumes in recent weeks this service was not sufficient to deal with the queries arising but with the additional resources now deployed the helpline service has improved and is continuing to improve.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that we learn from the lessons of this experience, I have arranged for an independent review into how the changes to IB were planned, implemented and &ndash; importantly &ndash; communicated to customers.  I expect this work to be completed by the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to sincerely apologise again for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments over the last few weeks. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

These payments are not taxable, are not subject to PRSI deductions, and are not taken into account for the purposes of means tests administered by my Department, and there are no plans to change this.  As a consequence, a Foster Parent with no other income may have no PRSI contributions paid during the period they were fostering.  Foster Parents who are working or self-employed pay PRSI contributions in respect of that work and qualify for social welfare entitlements on that basis.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded in the calculation of the yearly average of the pensioner.  This will generally have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, and may result in a higher rate of pension, depending on their circumstances. </p>  <p>  Under the interim Total Contribution Approach (TCA) for those pensioners affected by the rate band changes in 2012, HomeCaring periods will be available to those who looked after children up to 12 years of age or older where fulltime care and attention was required (to a maximum of 20 years for all credits and homecaring periods).  There is no post-1994 restriction on the years during which this caring period will have taken place. </p>  <p>  Claims continue to be subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied, including the requirement that 520 contributions be paid.</p>  <p>  Foster parents are entitled to the benefits of the existing homemakers scheme and it is planned this would continue for the new HomeCaring periods under TCA, on the same basis as other homemakers and carers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.  If the foster parent is not in receipt of Child Benefit they can still qualify for the home-makers scheme or HomeCaring periods if the caring periods are confirmed by TUSLA (these are cases where caring is for a short period of time).</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the current system and the interim TCA system which will be implemented shortly both provide for times spent caring to be taken into consideration in the calculation of pensions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or individuals who needed increased levels of care.  </p><p>The changes apply to those who reached pension age on or after 1<sup>st</sup>September 2012  who were awarded less than maximum rate, on post Budget 2012 rate bands.

As social insurance records are unique to individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  To date, over sixty temporary staff members have been recruited to work on this phase.  Further recruitment will take place in January  2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way and it is anticipated that the first review outcomes will be notified to pensioners during Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>Payment of increases, where awarded, will be made immediately after an individual's review is completed.  Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person's 66th birthday if later, and arrears paid.  If a pensioner does not qualify for an increased rate, they will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

The focus of CE is on developing technical and personal skills to enable a person to return to the open labour market.  Persons engaged are provided with work and training placements of 19&frac12; hours duration per week with a not-for-profit community sponsor delivering local services.</p><p>The CE programme is monitored on an on-going basis to ensure that the schemes are meeting the needs of communities and  jobseekers. The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for CE, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  </p><p>My Department undertook nationwide consultation workshops with key CE scheme sponsors and supervisors during May and early June 2017.  As part of these consultations, potential changes to the eligibility criteria were discussed and a number of changes were implemented thereafter. </p><p>The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to re-qualify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded. There is an overall limit of 6 years participation from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  Since 1st June, I am also facilitating persons to take up a placement on CE or T&uacute;s while also attending their JobPath provider. </p><p>The annual budget provided to CE schemes includes an amount to cover consumable services and materials, including insurance, necessary for the effective operation of the project. As part of Budget 2019, I increased the materials budget by &euro;2m. </p><p>The payment rates for participants on community employment (CE) are related to their underlying value of their social protection payment plus &euro;22.50 per week, with a minimum payment to each participant of &euro;220.50. In Budget 2019, I increased this minimum rate payment by a further &euro;5 increase in line with other payments in my Department.  In addition, a participant may be eligible, where appropriate, for payments in respect of any qualified dependant adult and children.  </p><p>I would like to reiterate that the Government strongly supports the work being done through these schemes and I have seen first-hand myself, over recent months, the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It was an ambitious target, particularly during a time of economic recession, but one to which the Government has remained committed.  The most recent poverty data from the CSO Survey on Income &amp;amp; Living Conditions (SILC) 2016 show that the consistent poverty rate had reduced to 8.3% from a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  </p>  <p>  However, the impact of the economic recovery was not fully reflected in this result, which captured income data for the period 2015-2016.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  When combined with measures introduced in recent Budgets, it is expected this will result in further improvements in the consistent poverty rate when the 2017 SILC data are released later this year.  </p>  <p>  The child-specific poverty target component of the NSTPR was to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The number of children in consistent poverty rose significantly from the 2011 baseline figure of 107,000 to a high of 152,000 in 2014.  By 2016, there were 132,000 children in consistent poverty requiring a reduction of more than 95,000 children in order to meet the 2020 target.</p>  <p>  It is important to give some perspective and a sense of the size of the challenge Ireland faces in trying to achieve the child poverty target.  In this context, it should be noted that at the height of the economic boom in 2008, when the consistent poverty rate for children was its lowest, there were 68,000 children in consistent poverty.  So, in order to meet the target, Ireland will have to be more than twice as effective as our best ever performance to date.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, social transfers continue to play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best performing EU States for reducing poverty through social transfers.  In 2016, social transfers more than halved the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children, from 40.3 per cent to 19.3 per cent.  </p>  <p>  In recent years with the improvement in the fiscal situation, the Government has been in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases which support families.  Budget 2019 has continued this trend with measures including a &euro;5 weekly increase to working age payments; increases to the qualified child allowance of &euro;2.20 per week for children under 12 years of age and &euro;5 per week for children over 12; additional increases to the earnings disregard for the One Parent Family payment and the Jobseekers transition payment (to &euro;150 per week); an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for both primary and secondary school children and an increase in the Christmas Bonus to 100%. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants.</p>  <p>  There are currently 1,345 Supervisors/Assistant Supervisors employed with CE sponsor organisations.  While my Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors, it does not - and has not - provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions. </p>  <p>  Employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer.  There is a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payments of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise just one small group within the wider community and voluntary sector.  Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Like its predecessor, the plan will  have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that aims to improve outcomes for  the vulnerable and marginalised in our society, while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives.  The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job.</p>  <p>  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty, which in 2016 was 8.3%.  This will be achieved through a three pronged approach: supporting incomes through as high as possible a level of employment, and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting the relevant welfare payments at appropriate levels; and finally improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing, community supports in order to minimise deprivation for all groups and, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes.  </p>  <p>  Following consultation on its development earlier this year and engagement with other Departments on appropriate actions for inclusion, work on the new strategy is at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In addition to the grave challenge posed by insecurity in the Anglophone North West and South West regions, Cameroon is also highly affected by the operations of the Boko Haram.  A further complication is the large number of refugees from the crisis in the Central African Republic who are taking refuge in the east of Cameroon.  </p>  <p>  I met the Cameroon Minister for Education in February, when we discussed the situation in his country. The escalation of violence in its South West and North West regions is the most pressing threat to political stability in Cameroon.</p>  <p>  The current unrest in the South West and North West regions began in November 2016 when English-speaking teachers and lawyers demonstrated against the dominant use of the French language. Separatists demanded the English-speaking North West and South West secede from the rest of the country. At least 400 civilians, 170 members of the armed forces, and an unknown number of separatists have died in violence associated with the secession crisis. According to UN OCHA, approximately 437,500 people have been displaced, with 26,000 people having sought refuge in Nigeria  .</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have an Embassy in Cameroon, our Embassy in Nigeria continues to monitor the situation closely as many refugees from Cameroon are crossing the border into Nigeria.  Our Ambassador in Nigeria recently met with Cameroonian refugees based in Calabar, Nigeria. Following this meeting, concerns raised by the refugees were brought to the attention of the Country Representative of UNHCR in Abuja. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaged in monitoring in the evolving humanitarian situation and its regional impact, via the UN Resident Coordinator, UNOCHA, the EU delegation in Yaound&eacute;, and in contacts with regional bodies. </p>  <p>  In this context, I recall the EEAS statement of 28 September on the situation in Cameroon, which called for constructive and inclusive dialogue for a sustainable solution.  It remains the responsibility of the Government of Cameroon to create a secure environment in which all citizens are protected from violence, and where international human rights standards, including protection for minority groups, are upheld. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the humanitarian efforts of United Nations and civil society bodies providing aid to those affected by the conflict.  Irish Aid rapid responders have been deployed to Cameroon and to Nigeria to assist the United Nations to respond to the needs of displaced persons and refugees. In addition, Ireland is directly providing non-food item kits for 5,000 displaced households in Cameroon. </p>  <p>  Ireland participated in the May 2018 review of the human rights situation in Cameroon by the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism.</p></reply>

High Representative Federica Mogherini has issued a statement on behalf of the European Union insisting on the need for &lsquo;continued thorough, credible and transparent investigation, shedding proper clarity on the circumstances of the killing and ensuring full accountability of all those responsible for it&rsquo;. Having called for investigation we must wait and give consideration to findings based on verifiable evidence before considering next steps. Our approach will be in tandem with our EU partners and will depend on the next steps taken by Saudi authorities.</p>  <p>  As previously mentioned in the D&aacute;il, I met with the Saudi Ambassador, H.E. Mr Nail bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, on 18 October and stressed the widespread shock caused by the case and the necessity for credible and open investigation. It is imperative that an investigation gets to the facts of the case and ensures that those responsible for the killing are held accountable. Senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to the Ambassador in recent weeks.  </p>  <p>  Freedom of expression is a fundamental right under international human rights law. Journalists play a vital role in holding governments to account. Ireland has consistently raised issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia, at bilateral, EU and international level. At the UN Human Rights Council in September, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on &lsquo;Safety of Journalists&rsquo;, condemning all violence against journalists and urging all states to ensure accountability for such attacks.</p>  <p>  Ireland specifically raised the Khashoggi case at the UN Human Rights Council on 5 November in our intervention during the Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s human rights record. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise concerns about human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever appropriate opportunities arise. </p></reply>

I not underestimate however the significant difficulties involved in securing the passage of this Bill; requiring as it does a two thirds majority in the House and sixty votes in the Senate.  </p><p>The Government - including through the Embassy and the work of Deputy John Deasy - will continue to engage proactively with the US Administration and elected representatives, both Democratic and Republican, on Irish immigration issues and specifically on this Bill.</p><p>Government efforts to assist the undocumented Irish in the US will also continue, as they have under previous Administrations. Through our many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government continues to explore a number of different options.  This remains a very challenging issue, however, as immigration reform has been a sensitive and divisive issue within the US political system for decades. </p><p>On the welfare of the undocumented Irish, the Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, work closely with Irish Immigration Centres, who support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States, including those who are undocumented.  These Centres all receive annual funding from the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme to support their important work. </p><p>The Taoiseach and I, together with our Government colleagues, Special Envoy Deputy Deasy, and our Embassy in Washington, D.C., will continue to give full priority to these issues.</p></reply>

The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU. The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU.  </p>  <p>  At the fifth Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels in November 2017 a revised Eastern Partnership multilateral architecture was adopted to contribute to the goals of the partnership, particularly by supporting the implementation of the &ldquo;20 Deliverables for 2020" which sets the future priorities for the initiative. This roadmap identifies a range of short and long-term milestones aimed at developing a stronger economy, governance, connectivity and society to make tangible and pragmatic improvements to the lives of citizens in partner countries.  A Ministerial meeting last month, which I attend, provided an opportunity for progress to be reviewed and for re-commitment to the objectives of the partnership.</p>  <p>  The EU remains committed to its political association and economic integration with Georgia and the successful implementation of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, which entered into force in July 2016. </p>  <p>  The EU has praised Georgia's reform efforts while underlining the need to ensure the sustainability of the changes which have already taken place including on democratic development and fundamental freedoms, on constitutional and parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption reforms.</p>  <p>  Georgia&rsquo;s new peace initiative, which the EU has fully supported, &lsquo;A Step to a Better Future&rsquo; is aimed at improving the humanitarian and socio-economic conditions of people residing in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, and at fostering people-to-people contacts, confidence building and reconciliation among the divided communities. </p>  <p>  In addition, the appointment last year of a new EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, as well as the EU Monitoring Mission, in which Ireland has representatives, are visible and substantial signs of the Union's commitment to helping Georgia address its security challenges.</p></reply>

It provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the EU for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. Member States contribute civilian and military personnel and assets to these peace support missions: Ireland currently deploys up to 19 civilians in missions in Georgia, Kosovo, Libya, Mali, Niger, Palestine and Ukraine and a further 30 personnel to military missions and operations in Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Mediterranean.  Ireland is a strong supporter of CSDP and of recent initiatives which improve the capacity of the Union to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN. Ireland does not believe that these contributions and initiatives are or should be characterised as &ldquo;militarisation&rdquo; of the EU.</p><p>The Paris Peace Forum, which concludes today, is an event hosted by President Macron. It is not an EU-hosted or managed event.  The Forum is discussing key issues such as climate change, human rights, debt and inequality, civil; society space, reform of the UN Security Council and migration. Its stated purpose is to make clear that tackling global challenges requires international cooperation and to advocate for multilateralism. As a strong supporter of both multilateralism and international cooperation, Ireland is attending the Forum and is represented by its Ambassador to France. </p></reply>

They do so where both a specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the TCA is satisfied, namely, the expenses to be covered by the flat rate amount are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.</p><p>The flat rate expense is agreed following engagement between Revenue and the relevant representative body for the particular group of employees who incur the same expense. This regime developed incrementally over the last 40 to 50 years, and currently incorporates some 53 employment categories covering broadly 134 individual flat rate expenses. A primary advantage of this regime is that it provides an efficient and transparent mechanism for a significant number of PAYE workers (over 536,000 in 2018), who incur a similar expense in the course of their employment duties, to obtain tax relief in respect of the expense without having to submit annual claims to Revenue. It also gives rise to efficiencies for Revenue by reducing the administrative cost of processing large volumes of identical claims for similar groups of employees.</p><p>Given the historic nature of some of the flat rate expenses and having regard to changes in employment circumstances, regulations and work practices across employments, Revenue commenced a comprehensive review of flat rate expenses this year. The purpose of the review, which is in line with best practice and good corporate governance, is to ensure the expenses agreed are still justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices and are in accordance with the legislative requirement for deduction as set out in section 114 of the TCA.  Arising from the review, there may be an adjustment to the quantum of particular flat rate expenses.  The flat rate amount may be increased or decreased or it may be withdrawn by Revenue where the continuation is no longer justified. </p><p>The flat rate expense categories initially selected by Revenue for review in 2018 were based on a combination of two factors, the quantum in terms of number of claimants and the value.  Revenue advised that they will continue their work in this area during 2019, and any revision to a flat rate expense will be communicated to the relevant representative body involved in the review process. It will also be communicated by Revenue by way of update to the relevant Tax and Duty Manual, which is available on the Revenue website.  </p><p>The flat rate expense for shop assistants was included in the current review. Revenue have advised that this flat rate expense is now to be withdrawn as they are satisfied that the legislative basis underpinning tax relief for expenses does not justify its continuation.  For 2018 there were 75,822 recipients of this particular flat rate expense of &euro;121, which gives rise to a total gross value of &euro;9.1 million.  </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the flat rate expense categories listed in the table below will be withdrawn with effect from 1 January 2019. It is not possible for Revenue to accurately quantify the tax saving/cost associated with this withdrawal as it depends on the particular circumstances of the individual recipients.<table><tr><th>Flat Rate Expense Category</th><th>Flat Rate Expense   Amount</th><th>Number of   recipients in 2018</th><th>Total gross value   of Flat Rate Expenses -  2018</th></tr><tr><td>Agricultural Advisers</td><td>&euro;671</td><td>122</td><td>&euro;81,862</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiac Technician </td><td>&euro;107/&euro;212</td><td>881</td><td>&euro;177,535</td></tr><tr><td>Journalist in employment</td><td>&euro;381/ &euro;153</td><td>8,134</td><td>&euro;2,255,910</td></tr><tr><td>Professional Valuer in the Valuation Office</td><td>&euro;680</td><td>42</td><td>&euro;28,560</td></tr><tr><td>Freelance Actors in employment</td><td>&euro;750</td><td>682</td><td>&euro;511,500</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Assistant</td><td>&euro;121</td><td>75,822</td><td>&euro;9,174,656 </td></tr></table></p><p>Revenue have advised that, outside of the flat rate expenses regime, all employees retain their right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.</p></reply>

The findings of the Report are that there was not a compelling business case to justify the provision of approximately &euro;170 million of Exchequer funding to establish a new system of local public banking, based on the model considered. </p><p>However, the Government is committed to examining how the concept and objectives of local public /community banking may be furthered in Ireland. This will be through an independent evaluation and stakeholder forum. My Department will carry out a tender process for an external agency to carry out the independent evaluation and stakeholder forum and the terms of reference have been finalised, with input from stakeholders. I anticipate that the completed tender documents will be with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in the near future and expect that the tender process will be complete by January 2019. </p><p>Irish Rural Link, along with the Savings Bank Foundation for International Cooperation, the international development wing of the Sparkassen Group, put forward a proposal and strategic plan for a potential model of local public banking for Ireland, based on the German model that was considered in the Report. This I would ask the Deputy to draw his constituent&rsquo;s attention to Irish Rural Link&rsquo;s response to the Report on Local Public Banking, which is available on Irish Rural Link&rsquo;s website: </p><p><i> </i></p><p>This response states that &ldquo;&hellip; it is not proposed that the mortgage market would be a priority of the local public bank...&rdquo; and that &ldquo;&hellip; providing lower rate mortgages is a goal but not a priority of the model&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Regarding the tracker mortgage examination, as the Deputy is aware the Central Bank is working to ensure that the tracker mortgage examination is completed as soon as possible. The Bank is producing regular updates of progress on its website, the most recent being published on the 25 April 2018: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Since then, the Governor of the Central Bank provided some updated information at his recent appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. The Governor indicated that at end-August, 38,400 customers have now been identified in the tracker examination and that some 93% of affected customers have received offers of redress and compensation. Also it was indicated that four of five main lenders are close to completing their redress and compensation phases and that the Central Bank is exerting pressure on the remaining lender to finish its process. The Central Bank has also advised that it is currently pursuing enforcement investigations against all of the main lenders. </p><p>The Government has made it clear that they will continue to support the Central Bank&rsquo;s work to conclude the Tracker Mortgage Examination as quickly as possible, and to see all impacted customers provided with redress and compensation.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1% on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.    </p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. </p>  <p>  My Department very recently received a proposal from the sector advocating for a change to a gross profit tax model. This is something I am willing to consider in the context of Budget 2020, notwithstanding concerns brought to my attention about the compatibility of this proposal with EU rules and the greater capacity within the model to reduce overall betting duty receipts. </p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p></reply>

It was a notified aid up to October 2015, after which it came within the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER).  A number of changes to EII were necessary to ensure that it is consistent with GBER.  </p>  <p>  Revenue advises me that the changes to EII mean that there is increased degree of complexity in determining whether or, not a company qualifies for relief and that this in turn means that each application takes longer to review.  Applications received by Revenue are not always complete, with necessary documentation often not provided.  In this instance, further information must be sought before a decision can be made.  Of the cases currently being worked by Revenue's EII Branch, 82% have required follow up correspondence.  While some of those are requests for clarifications, the majority relate to incomplete applications.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the EII branch has prioritised the review of all EII 1 Applications received with a view to finalising as many cases as possible before the Return Filing Deadline and that every effort will be made by the it to ensure that as many cases as possible are processed before the Return Filing Deadline. </p>  <p>  Revenue also point out that an EII Application can be made once the investment has taken place.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that, in Finance Bill 2018, in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EII, including addressing the issue of administrative hold-ups, I have moved to change the administration of EII to a self-certification model.  Under this model, a company will be able to self-certify that it complies with the conditions of the relief applicable to the company, while investors will self-certify that they meet the conditions of the relief applicable to the investors.</p></reply>

It was further notified on 9 May 2018 that the liquidators of the insurance company Alpha Insurance A/S had filed a petition for bankruptcy. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that as Alpha Insurance A/S is a Danish based insurance firm, it is subject to prudential supervision by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and therefore it had no role in this decision. It has also informed me that Alpha Insurance A/S was selling non-life insurance policies in Ireland through the broker network on a freedom of services basis and that it also operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and Spain.</p>  <p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is primarily designed to facilitate payments to claimants in relation to risks in the State where an Irish authorised non-life insurer or a non-life insurer authorised in another EU member state goes into liquidation. As I understand it, there are no claims outstanding and thus the ICF has no role to play in this case. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, as the structural warranty insurance was initially purchased by the property developer, the affected residents may wish to get in contact with the developer in the first instance to see if alternative cover can be arranged. </p></reply>

One of these measures was the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules, or the alignment of existing national CFC rules with ATAD where relevant, by 1 January 2019.</p><p>CFC rules are an anti-abuse measure, designed to prevent the diversion of profits to offshore entities in low or no tax jurisdictions. Where CFC rules apply, they have the effect of attributing certain undistributed income of such an entity to its parent company.</p><p>ATAD provides that Member States may choose one of two options to determine whether income of a CFC should be attributed to a parent company:</p><p>A. Option A attributes certain categories of undistributed passive income of a CFC to the parent company, or </p><p>B. Option B attributes undistributed income arising from non-genuine arrangements put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage.  </p><p>These options were unanimously agreed by all Member States on the introduction of ATAD and each Member State must choose between the options in transposing ATAD &ndash; neither option is specified to be more effective than the other in tackling corporate tax avoidance.  European Commission officials have indicated in discussions their view that Member States do not have the option to incorporate both options, or a hybrid containing elements of both options, when transposing ATAD. </p><p>CFC rules introduce a significant new administrative burden both for businesses and for Revenue authorities, therefore my officials engaged in extensive consultation in advance of Finance Bill 2018.  In October 2017 my Department published a consultation paper on the Coffey Review recommendations and the implementation of ATAD, inviting submissions on a range of issues including the implementation of ATAD CFC rules and the choice between Options A and B.  Responses to this consultation were summarised in the Corporation Tax Roadmap and have been published in full on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The 2018 Tax Strategy Group paper for corporation tax indicated that, following consideration of the consultation submissions received, it was intended that Ireland would opt for the Option B approach when introducing CFC rules.  The paper, which invited comments and discussion on the options set out, was discussed at the TSG meeting in July this year and subsequently published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Reasons for electing for the Option B approach include:</p><p>- Consistency with the existing Irish tax policy focus on the taxation of activities with substance in, or a nexus to, Ireland.</p><p>- Consistency with long-standing policy in developing anti-avoidance rules based on principle purpose tests.</p><p>- The similarity of Option B to the established CFC rules in the UK, a major trading partner and a jurisdiction with a structurally similar tax system.</p><p>- Greater ease of administration for business and Revenue, in view of the calculation of profits to be attributed under internationally understood arms-length transfer pricing principles.</p><p>- Focusing on CFC income which has been artificially diverted from Ireland ensures that a proportionate response is applied to the profit shifting risks that exist within an Irish context.</p><p>The Corporation Tax Roadmap, published in September, again indicated that an Option B approach was planned.  Subsequently the CFC Feedback Statement, also published in September, set out the rationale for the proposed approach and again invited feedback on a range of policy decisions.<i></i></p><p>My officials have engaged with the European Commission in relation to the implementation of ATAD on many occasions over the last year.  The Corporation Tax Roadmap, which confirmed our election for Option B was brought to the attention of the relevant European Commissioners and Commission Services and all other EU Member States. </p></reply>

The SBCI currently has seven on-lenders, three banks and four non-bank finance providers. </p>  <p>  Since it began its operations in March 2015, to the end of March 2018, there has been &euro;972 million of SBCI supported lending, supporting over 24,000 SMEs and 129,300 jobs. The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from all sectors of the Irish economy and have a wide geographical spread, with approximately 85% of loans going outside Dublin and 26% of loans going to the Agriculture sector.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has not granted guarantees or risk-sharing facilities to any SMEs from outside the State in the past two years to date. Both the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, which are the SBCI&rsquo;s current risk-sharing guarantee schemes in operation at present, require the beneficiary to be established and operating in the State.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals, nor am I in a position to direct them to provide cover to such individuals. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life assurance cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the length of time with which such a policy may last.  Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. </p>  <p>  In response to a similar parliamentary question last month (PQ No. 118 of 3 October 2018), my officials sought the views of Insurance Ireland.  They advised that applicants for any type of life assurance will be asked on the application form detailed health questions and that insurers may request one or more of the following in addition: a report from the applicant&rsquo;s GP; an independent medical examination; or other medical tests.  On the basis of the information provided, the application is considered individually and the decision on whether to offer cover and on what terms depends on the facts of that particular case. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914. </p></reply>

The SBCI&rsquo;s goal is to increase the availability of appropriately priced, flexible funding to viable Irish SMEs. The strategic mission of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish credit market, while driving competition and innovation and ensuring the efficient use of available EU resources. </p><p>The SBCI uses an on-lending model. This means it does not lend directly to SMEs. Rather, the SBCI provides funds through partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. To date the SBCI has provided the following funding to bank on-lenders referred to by the Deputy. These funds have been given to provide lower cost financing to SMEs, all of which has been fully deployed by those banks to over 14,000 SMEs.<table><tr><th>AIB</th><th>&euro;400 million</th></tr><tr><td>Bank of Ireland</td><td>&euro;150 million</td></tr><tr><td>Ulster Bank </td><td>&euro;70 million </td></tr></table></p><p>The SBCI has also provided funding of over &euro;230 million to its non-bank lending partners. </p><p>The SBCI has an independent board of directors and there is a comprehensive governance and oversight structure in place as part of the SBCI&rsquo;s corporate structure. The SBCI also complies with the Revised 2016 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  While the SBCI board is accountable to the Minister for Finance, it is independent, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 specifically prohibits me as, Minister for Finance, from acting as a shadow director. Therefore, I am not in a position to get involved in or comment on specific decisions made by the selection committee of the SBCI as part of the process of considering prospective on-lenders. </p><p>I am advised by the SBCI that it undertakes regular and robust reviews of all its current on-lending partners to ensure that SBCI funding is being deployed to eligible SMEs and that those SMEs receive the full benefit of the lower cost funding. I understand that monitoring is done through a combination of regular meetings between the SBCI and each on-lender, detailed reporting of each loan advanced by the on-lender to the SME, which is updated quarterly, and independent audits.</p><p>None of the banks&rsquo; auditing and accounting firms sit on the selection committee for on-lenders of the SBCI. Instead, I am informed that the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lending partners are selected by the SBCI&rsquo;s board of directors, after a thorough due diligence process. </p><p>The Deputy may rest assured that the SBCI is keen to work with any lender, large or small, that can demonstrate it can deliver the required funding advantage to eligible SMEs on terms that protect taxpayer money. The SBCI&rsquo;s strategy in relation to on-lenders is based on developing a strong pipeline of potential on-lenders to achieve diversity in the market and encourage competition. </p></reply>

This includes identifying vacant residential properties, as well as exploring opportunities to undertake remediation and completion works at a number of unfinished developments that are in the control of NAMA debtors.  In instances where properties are not complete or require remediation, NAMA commits to fund their remediation and/or completion, subject to commercial viability.</p>  <p>  Up until end-October 2018, NAMA had identified a total of 6,984 residential properties as being potentially suitably for social housing.  The location of these properties was made known to the Housing Agency, which liaised with local authorities across Ireland to determine the demand for these units.  NAMA had no direct interaction with the local authorities.  Of the units identified, demand was confirmed by local authorities for 2,718 properties, of which 2,475 have been contracted or delivered for social housing use to date.  Additionally, as part of new developments, NAMA debtors and receivers provided residential units in compliance with Part V planning obligations.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that NAMA&rsquo;s debtors have the right to maximise the sales value of properties securing their loans so as to enable them to maximise their debt repayments.  Therefore, NAMA cannot require a debtor to take action which would reduce his/her repayment capacity, such as the sale of property at less than its market value.</p></reply>

This is a matter between the Housing Agency and local authorities.</p><p>I am advised that an important consideration for local authorities is the requirement to provide for an appropriate mix of housing tenures and to avoid undue housing segregation within individual developments and wider residential areas.

I pointed out that taxing revenue rather than profits would undermine European competitiveness and could intensify already heightened trade tensions.  </p>  <p>  While Ireland is among a number of Member States which object to the fundamental nature of the proposal, we are joined by a wider group which share our concerns on a series of technical issues yet to be resolved.  Discussions will continue this month on the many outstanding technical issues on the proposal with the topic likely to be back on the agenda for December&rsquo;s ECOFIN.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to global tax reform and believes that global solutions are needed to ensure tax is paid by companies where value is created.  That is why Ireland has been a committed participant in, and strong supporter of, tax reform efforts led by the OECD through the BEPS process.  Ireland will continue to actively engage with work in the area of the digital economy at both OECD and EU level.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p>  <p>  In a general sense, it is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the length of time with which such a policy may last.  Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  </p>  <p>  Based on the assumption that the Deputy is referring to whole-of-life insurance policies, I have been advised that in the early years the payments for such products are higher than the cost of the policy holder&rsquo;s chosen benefits with the extra money paid going into a plan fund.  However, protection benefits become more expensive as policy holders get older with the result that payments into the plan begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly, and in order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund. </p>  <p>  In order to see if the consumer&rsquo;s regular payment plus any fund that has been built up is enough to cover their chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan, an insurance company carries out regular reviews of these plans.  During such a review the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover that the consumer wants.  However, the insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer, thus explaining why a number of people are finding that their premiums are increasing. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, while I have sympathy for the concerns that have been expressed, it is important to note that I am unable to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply, including on the imposition of caps for increases in order to maintain cover under life insurance policies.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1% on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes.  It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions.  With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online.  I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers.  While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others.  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.    </p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was.  The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. </p>  <p>  My Department very recently received a proposal from the sector advocating for a change to a gross profit tax model.  This is something I am willing to consider in the context of Budget 2020, notwithstanding concerns brought to my attention about the compatibility of this proposal with EU rules and the greater capacity within the model to reduce overall betting duty receipts. </p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society.  While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers.  This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p></reply>

These arrangements enable public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in place for 1 year until they reach the age of eligibility for the State pension which is currently 66.  The purpose of the arrangements is to offer a limited, temporary solution to individuals who reach the age of 65 before the commencement of the necessary legislation.  If the interim arrangements had not existed, the individuals concerned would have had to cease working at age 65 because the policy change proposed can only be effected by legislative change.</p>  <p>  The interim arrangements were never intended to and indeed could not offer a perfect solution or put these individuals in the same position as the public servants who are covered by the legislation.  I understand that the temporary arrangements were welcomed in that context and it was clearly indicated that availing of the arrangements did not confer any rights on the individual public servant to any new arrangement that might be provided for in future legislation.  The legislation has been drafted on that basis and is currently under consideration by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The public servants who are availing of the interim arrangements have retired and received their pension benefits.  This was necessary in order to respect the current statutory requirement for this cohort to retire at age 65.  Lump sums have been paid and participants are no longer paying a pension contribution or accruing additional pension benefits.  There are significant complexities associated with the unravelling of that arrangement and the extension of legislative arrangements to this cohort. It would raise issues in terms of how pay and pension should be treated in the context of the period while the individual was on the interim arrangements and into the future.  It may require the repayment of lump sums awarded which would present its own difficulties in terms of moneys owing to the Exchequer and possibly also for the individuals concerned. Additional costs in terms of pay would arise in order to place them on a commensurate pay point to those currently covered by the Bill while it would compromise, at additional cost, the current policy with existing retire and rehire arrangements across the public service of recruitment at the minimum point.  </p>  <p>  With any change in policy, there are always individuals who will lose out because they miss the deadline by a matter of days or weeks. When the interim arrangements were introduced on 5 December 2017, there may have been people who would have wished to avail of the interim arrangements but they did not qualify because they reached the age of 65 a matter of days before the date of the Government Decision.  Also, it is likely that given the passage of time, some of those who availed of the interim arrangements may have ceased employment given that over a year will have passed by the time the legislation is enacted.  No doubt the matters raised will receive significant attention at Committee Stage for the Bill and I will be happy to engage on those issues as part of the legislative process.</p></reply>

I am advised that, in the first instance, the management of problems of coastal protection in the area indicated remains a matter for Meath County Council. </p>  <p>  Following the severe storms of Winter 2013/2014, the Government allocated funding for clean-up, repair and restoration works in relation to public infrastructure that was damaged in the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014.  Funding for repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure was made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities. Total funding of &euro;126,792 was allocated by the OPW to Meath County Council for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure. The Council has confirmed that the works at Laytown, including the replacement of gabions/rock armour revetment sea defence systems were carried out using this funding. This, however, was a once off allocation and no further funding is available under this stream. </p>  <p>  Meath County Council can apply for funding under the Office of Public Works&rsquo; (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects that meet the eligibility criteria, including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. </p></reply>

The latest framework for reform and innovation in the public service<i>, Our</i><i>Public Service 2020 </i>(OPS 2020)<i>&ndash;</i>which I launched last December, is a whole-of-public-service initiative designed to build on the previous reforms to which I refer while expanding the scope of reform to focus on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. The OPS 2020 framework contains 18 actions, and it is built on three key pillars as follows:  </p><p><b>Delivering for Our Public</b>focuses on ensuring that outcomes for the public are central to service delivery. This will be achieved by involving the public in the design and delivery of services, by improving how we listen and communicate, and by ensuring services are cost-effective. By making better use of new technology and data we will also improve service quality and accessibility. The five actions under this pillar will build on existing progress in areas such as shared services and procurement. The development of digital services and eGovernment is key to improving service delivery as is making better use of data and sharing data more effectively between organisations.</p><p><b>Innovating for Our Future</b>has six actions that will enable the development of innovative, robust and joined-up strategies and policies related to the delivery of public services. This pillar will also support collaboration across the public service and help make the most of existing skills and experiences, and data. It will also promote a culture of evaluation. The public service needs to be increasingly innovative and collaborative to effectively respond to the complex challenges facing Ireland now and into the future.</p><p><b>Developing Our People and Organisations</b>has seven actions which will support public servants and the organisations in which they work. The pillar aims to improve human resource management and to ensure the right mix of skills and tools are there to support public servants in delivering quality services. The actions in this pillar will help to build strong and agile public service organisations. Actions focus on sharing best practice and experience in areas such as strategic human resource management, workforce planning, employee engagement, public service culture and values, and equality, diversity and inclusion. </p><p>Six action teams involving over one hundred public servants from across the public sector are already pursuing work programmes under OPS 2020 in the areas such as digital delivery of services, promoting innovation, optimising the use of data, project management, workforce planning, and professional development. In addition to these actions, reform is taking place independent of the framework, whether in a whole-of-government context or Department/Sector led reforms. OPS 2020 includes a chapter outlining key reform strategies from the main sectors namely Health, Justice and Equality, Education, Local Government, Defence and the Civil Service. It also includes material on Government and legislative reform. Significant reforms initiated under the Civil Service Renewal Plan also continue to take effect and work is advancing on a refreshed Civil Service Renewal Plan which will build on the progress to date and align with programme of reform set out in Our Public Service 2020.</p><p>The implementation of OPS 2020 is underpinned by a shared ownership of its actions across the public service and by ensuring a strong emphasis on evaluating reforms. A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the new reform agenda and lead on its implementation. This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.</p></reply>

Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year in Dublin, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.  I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. </p>  <p>  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools. The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when fully commenced will assist in addressing these issues.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, on the 3rd October 2018, my predecessor Minister Bruton, commenced a number of sections of the Act. On that date the Minister also announced the commencement of Section 8 of the Act, from Monday 3rd December 2018, which will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This power will come into effect on Monday 3rd December 2018. The NCSE will engage with the education partners and finalise procedures in advance of this date. This new power will build on the work which has been done in recent years to facilitate schools to open special classes.</p>  <p>  Section 67 of the Act will provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment. </p>  <p>  A number of the remaining sections of the Act which have not yet been commenced including Section 67, require regulations and procedures to be drafted, and will require consultation with the Education Partners prior to commencement.</p>  <p>  I intend to have the other remaining sections of the Act commenced in time for admissions to the 2020/21 school year.</p></reply>

The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority.  The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2018. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines.  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the relevant awarding authority shall establish:</p><p>- the method for measuring a route; and</p><p>- the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route.</p><p>SUSI has progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures is the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants.  SUSI continues to use google maps to calculate distance from a student&rsquo;s home to college.</p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe.

Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.  Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households. </p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Student Grant Scheme 2018 deals with issues governing the determination of reckonable income. In calculating reckonable income, no account is taken of capital assets. However, income from all sources, whether it arises in the State or not, including rental and other income from land and property are considered as part of the means test for student grants. </p></reply>

DEIS Plan 2017 has as its third goal - To improve the capacity of school leaders and teachers to engage, plan and deploy resources to their best advantage.  Schools who have been designated as DEIS are provided with a range of additional supports under the School Support Programme (SSP) including lower class sizes for those schools with the highest levels of disadvantage.  Administrative principals are also allocated on a lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally and post primary schools have an enhanced guidance allocation.  Teachers in DEIS schools also have priority access to CPD and the Centre for School Leadership. </p>  <p>  Success in education is built inter alia on the quality of leadership and ingenuity in teaching and we are fortunate in Ireland to attract high calibre people to the fields of teaching and training who deliver to high standards.  As Minister for Education and Skills, I acknowledge the commitment shown by all teachers, in particular those in DEIS schools.  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that at the present time,  my Department is not considering the provision of an extra allowance for teachers in DEIS schools.</p></reply>

Current expenditure on higher education, excluding pay restoration and pension provision, will increase by 10% in 2019 compared to 2016.  We are adopting a number of measures to address the financial challenges in higher education and to ensure that higher education investment is responsive to key strategic priorities.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 continued the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of reinvestment in higher education.  Through the budget, we have provided &euro;57 million in additional current funding for the higher education sector.  This is in addition to separate funding that has been provided for pay deals and pensions, amounting to an additional &euro;41 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  This new current funding will be used to fund the following measures: </p>  <p>  - provision for 3,500 additional places in our higher education institutions </p>  <p>  - initiatives to support innovation and reward excellence</p>  <p>  - investment in teaching and learning capacity, and management and leadership</p>  <p>  - 1,000 additional places on Springboard+, </p>  <p>  - a new research fund for Institutes of Technology/TUs, and </p>  <p>  - an expansion of part-time and flexible learning opportunities. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also announced a new Human Capital Initiative that will involve investment of &euro;300 million in higher education over the 5 year period from 2020 to 2024, with &euro;60 million being made available in each of those years.  This investment will be funded by the National Training Fund surplus.  A major objective of the Initiative is to incentivise continued reform and innovation drawing on international best practice through such mechanisms as graduate conversion, accelerated course completion, flexible and blended learning, intensified focus on employability and strengthened linkages and relationships with enterprise.  It represents a significant response to projected demographic pressures impacting on the HE sector over the next five years, as highlighted in the Expert Group Report on Future Funding.</p>  <p>  The National Training Fund is being reformed to make it more labour market focused, responsive to skills needs and providing additional investment in Further and Higher Education. Progress in implementing reforms has enabled an increase in the NTF levy by 0.1% respectively in both 2018 and 2019, with a commitment to a further 0.1% increase in 2020. </p>  <p>  In order to build a political consensus regarding a future approach to funding the higher Education Sector the Minister for Education and Skills referred the expert group report to the Parliamentary Committee on Education for their consideration.  After a period of 18 months, the Committee wrote back to the Minister in January 2018 requesting that the Ministry of Education and Skills undertake an economic examination of the three policy options proposed by the expert group to assist the Committee in forming its view of the most appropriate option.</p>  <p>  The Department has applied for the support of the Structural Reform Support Programme 2017-2020 in undertaking this economic analysis of the three policy options identified by the expert group.  The closing date for applications was 31 October 2018.  A decision is awaited on the outcome of the application.  Successful projects are expected to proceed in early 2019.  Having this evaluation undertaken through the Commission&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme will provide the type of international expertise, analysis, and objectivity that would be beneficial to a major evaluation of this nature.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the HEA are currently reforming the model by which funding is allocated to our higher education institutions.  The independent panel&rsquo;s review provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, that incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as research and STEM provision, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy.  This will ensure that the additional funding that has been made available for higher education is targeted effectively and that institutions are held accountable for how they use public resources.</p></reply>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 will see numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level. Over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.3:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2017/18 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.5 in the same period.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the teacher numbers has to be considered as part of future budgetary processes, alongside the many other demands from the education sector </p></reply>

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector. My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices across all sectors.  New apprenticeship registrations have risen from 2,698 in 2014 to 4,843 in 2017, which represents an increase of almost 80%.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry.  To date 17 new apprenticeship programmes are now operational following the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017.  These new programmes span a variety of sectors ranging from financial services, biopharma, ICT to hospitality.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2018 and 2019 in various sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeships 2016-2020 we will see over 40 new apprenticeships being delivered.</p></reply>

To put this decision into effect, an Addendum to the scheme was drafted and has been approved by the Attorney General. This Addendum is published on the website of my Department - www.justice.ie - and lists the applicable institutions. Letters to the women potentially covered by the Addendum are issuing this week.</p><p>Although there is a difference in the way awards are calculated as between those women who are covered under the original 2013 scheme and those covered by the Government decision of May 2018, it is Government policy that benefits should accrue to both cohorts in the same way. This necessitates changes to two primary pieces of legislation - covering  tax exemption in respect of awards made and the provision of certain health services.  To this end, a specific provision in respect of tax exemption has been made in the Finance Bill 2018. Further, the Government has recently approved the drafting of an amendment to the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 to ensure that same health benefits that apply to the women covered by the original 2013 scheme also apply to those women covered by the Addendum. Both legislative amendments will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

However, I am advised that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources in East Meath. </p>  <p>  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducting full investigation into the firearm incident highlighted by the Deputy and as such it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that every effort will continue to be made to disrupt the activities of any groups who may be involved in these incidents and to arrest and prosecute offenders.</p>  <p>  In relation to drug related crime, it is important to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime.  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 35 have been assigned to Drogheda Garda station. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College and we are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. </p>  <p>  I strongly welcome the funding provided in Budget 2019 for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda recruits next year, along with necessary civilian Garda staff. This ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties following civilianisation of their roles. The net benefit of this is the increased Garda visibility and greater response to the policing needs of communities in every Garda Division.</p></reply>

The Steering Group meets approximately once a month to monitor progress.   </p>  <p>  The Director of the DSS is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the DSS can be up and running as quickly as possible.  There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. </p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the DSS has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the DSS has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.  </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the MHC engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service.  The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p>  <p>  The MHC has in recent weeks received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the DSS and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the MHC and DSS.  The MHC proposes to recruit these staff on a phased basis between now and 1 January 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Work on the draft regulations is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

The Law Reform Commission published a comprehensive report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety in September 2016.  This report contained a number of recommendations to further strengthen the criminal justice and regulatory response to harm perpetrated online.</p><p>In December 2016, the Government approved the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill to address the criminal law elements of the Commission's report.  Subsequently, as the Deputy will be aware, Deputy Brendan Howlin published a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill entitled the <i>Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 </i>which completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government.  The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications.  The Bill creates new offences to deal with the distribution of intimate images without consent.  The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications, and including communication about a person, which is most relevant to this question. </p><p>Cabinet agreed in May this year to cease work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin's Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as swiftly as possible. Officials in my Department have met with Labour Party officials with the intention of identifying and bringing forward any necessary Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be as effective as possible.  I am currently awaiting legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in relation to these proposed amendments and I am committed to enacting this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, a Deportation Order ceases to have legal effect, and as such, must be revoked.</p>  <p>  That application for international protection was subsequently refused, in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 and a notification of intention to deport, under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), was issued to the person concerned by letter dated 20th July, 2018.  That communication advised the person concerned of the options open to them as a result.  I am advised that the person concerned has submitted written representations in response to that notification.  These representations, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), and all other applicable legislation, before a final decision is taken.

In order to meet the accommodation needs in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services by way of the independent living model, to persons in the protection process, will be advertised.  This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and for completion in 2020. This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State.</p></reply>

On completion of the necessary processing the application will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union level, and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. While most straightforward cases are now processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The purpose of the investigation was to assess whether the conduct of any Garda member would constitute an offence.  GSOC&rsquo;s investigation found that, while no such conduct occurred which would require criminal sanction, certain aspects were identified as requiring further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  That further investigation by GSOC is on-going and I do not propose to comment on that matter while the investigation is proceeding.</p>  <p>  As I have made clear to the House, both in response to the motion calling for an investigation and subsequently in response to various Parliamentary Questions, it is imperative that the independence of the Ombudsman Commission be respected and any further action be deferred until the current investigation is completed.  I reiterate the point that the question of what further action might be taken will be fully considered by Government as soon as the disciplinary investigation is completed.</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service has advised that it was due to the requirement for the Governor of each prison to check the records with regard to the relevant institution.</p><p>I am advised that the attached table reflects the number of instances of prisoners sleeping on mattresses on cell floors in Cloverhill, Midlands, Castlerea, Cork and Limerick prisons each night during the period in question.  I am further advised that in the remaining 7 prisons, no prisoner slept on the floor.</p><p>It should be noted that the Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts and does not have the option of refusing to take prisoners into custody. While increases in prisoner population numbers result in challenges within certain committal prisons, the Prison Service takes all possible steps to alleviate the situation through a combination of inter-prison transfers and other contingency measures. </p><p>Officials in the Prison Service work closely with Governors of affected prisons to alleviate capacity issues, by identifying prisoners who may be suitable for transfer to other prisons or prisoners who may be suitable for structured early release.</p><p>Prison refurbishment, which includes the provision of extra prison spaces, has placed additional pressure on prison capacity during the period in question. Relevant projects included refurbishment at D1 Landing at Cloverhill Prison, two Units at Wheatfield Place of Detention, the construction of the Violence Reduction Unit at Midlands Prison, and renovation and refurbishment works at Castlerea Prison. These projects, while an essential element of modernisation,  result in unavoidable temporary bed closures - and consequential reductions in capacity - while the works are undertaken.</p><p>I would also like to inform the Deputy that with regard to a similar question asked by her in July 2018 (D&aacute;il Questions 673, 737, 738 and 748) I have been informed by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that, due to a methodological error, the figures provided on that occasion were not accurate.  A revised methodology has now been implemented to ensure that the correct figures will be provided in future.  This is very much regretted and the information provided in the table attached now includes the correct figures.</p></reply>

The designated official, at Assistant Secretary level, is supported by a staff complement of seven (one Principal Officer, three Assistant Principal Officers, two Higher Executive Officers and one Clerical Officer).  The Unit also leads on engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to inform and validate our response to Brexit. </p>  <p>  Also within this Division, two officials (Assistant Principal Officer and Administrative Officer) working in the Trade Policy Unit are assigned to Brexit related trade matters as part of their portfolios.</p>  <p>  In the Division with responsibility for Indigenous Enterprise, there are two officials (Assistant Principal Officer and Administrative Officer) working solely on Brexit mitigation measures to support business impacted by Brexit.   This team also has a strong relationship with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and earlier this year launched a new Brexit Loan Scheme for businesses in response to Brexit.  Other officials across this Division have Brexit related responsibility attached to their roles, and work closely with the Department&rsquo;s enterprise agencies to prepare businesses in Ireland for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union continues to impact significantly on all policy fields across my Department as well as our family of agencies.   In this regard, staff in the Agency Liaison Units of the Department, work closely with the agencies under its remit to support those agencies in providing specific advice and guidance to businesses in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Such supports include the SME Scorecard online tool, which was developed by Enterprise Ireland in conjunction with the staff in the Enterprise Liaison Unit.  This scorecard stimulates thinking about the key areas that may be impacted by Brexit and provides a self-assessment tool to ascertain a business level of preparedness.  Officials in the Inward Investment area of my Department work directly with IDA Ireland to provide practical assistance and advice on Brexit risks and opportunities, including financial assistance across R&amp;D, training, employment and capital investment.  InterTrade Ireland, which provides a Brexit Advisory Service to help businesses with practical advice and support likely tariffs, currency management, regulatory customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services, is also supported by officials in my Department.  Staff in the LEO Liaison Unit in my Department work closely with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  The LEOs have a presence in every county and provide vital Brexit supports to micro businesses in Ireland and assist in identifying key Brexit exposures and develop robust strategies to address issues and maximise potential.</p>  <p>  Given the wide mission of my Department, staff across a number of other Divisions and business units, are involved in a range of business preparedness supports and Brexit related matters, as it relates to their policy area.  The staff in the Health and Safety Liaison Unit, work with the Health and Safety Authority to support Irish chemical companies.  Support is also provided to the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) by officials in my Department to ensure businesses are certified to appropriate standards to access markets.</p>  <p>  My Department is continually prioritising the Brexit challenges and actively keep the staffing requirements under review.</p></reply>

The company are taking these steps now to set out a strategy that takes into account its obligation to operate in a decarbonised economy. </p>  <p>  I welcome that the redundancies are being sought on a voluntary basis and that extensive consultation will take place with the workers in the coming weeks. I also welcome that the Board and Management of Bord na M&oacute;na in outlining their plans are committed to ensuring that the company will be able to provide long-term, sustainable employment for the Midlands, including up to 500 new jobs in new areas of the business.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that all relevant State supports are being made available to the workers impacted by the announcement. Bord na M&oacute;na will provide additional supports to workers who opt for redundancy, including reskilling opportunities. </p>  <p>  My Department together with its agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, will also step up their own work in seeking to support entrepreneurship and new investment in the Midlands. Specifically, they are engaging with the Bord na M&oacute;na Transition Team set up by Offaly County Council. All agencies are involved in this initiative. </p>  <p>  The Midlands has had strong employment growth in recent years, with 15,300 extra people at work since 2015. Specifically, in 2017, 819 client companies of the Local Enterprise Offices added 387 new employees, making a total of 4,214 employees. There have been a series of very positive job creation announcements in the Midlands in recent years and we expect these trends to continue.</p>  <p>  Recent announcements include: Leetha Industries (100 jobs), Center Parcs (1,000 jobs plus 750 jobs during construction), Neudea Technologies (200 jobs) and Glanbia with its US partner Leprino (78 jobs plus 250 jobs during construction). I was also pleased to launch a new Irish Manufacturing Research CLG project located in Mullingar in December last year as one of the significant funding recipients under the first call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which will be an important support to manufacturing activity in the Midlands region.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also actively collaborating with the Midlands Regional Action Plan for Jobs Committee in refreshing its Action Plan. I understand the Committee is actively considering the impact of the recent announcement and the potential opportunities in the green economy that could be included in the work of the Committee as part of its forthcoming Action Plan.  </p></reply>

In advance of commencement, the Department engaged in a national information campaign. The Act applies to both written and oral construction contracts, although some do not fall within its remit, for example, if the value of a contract is not more than &euro;10,000. It also introduced a statutory entitlement to adjudication for parties to a relevant construction contract in circumstances where a payment dispute subsequently arises.</p>  <p>  The Act provides important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry. It imposes minimum contractual provisions in relation to payments, particularly the timing of payments and the parties to a relevant construction contract cannot opt out of the provisions of the legislation. </p>  <p>  Comprehensive information on the Act is available on the website of the Department at www.dbei.gov.ie. It is important that subcontractors exercise their rights under the legislation to ensure that payment is received for work carried out under a construction contract. Due to the private nature of such contractual arrangements however, it is not possible to accurately assess the extent to which subcontractors are exercising their rights under the legislation. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue both to monitor the effectiveness of the legislation and to consult with key construction sector stakeholders as to its ongoing impact.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in regional areas to its client base. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing IDA client companies.</p><p>Site visits nevertheless do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.</p><p>The availability of an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile FDI. The availability of property solutions allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is, therefore, an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to the country and especially to regional Ireland.  </p><p>The tables below respectively set out the total

The Commission also recognised that the implementation of the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim, while necessary of itself, would serve to highlight further the differential in pay between the pre-existing cadre of consultants and new entrants. </p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Pay Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have noted the Commission's views and consideration will need to be given to potential solutions which are in line with public sector pay policy and available budgets.

The report is available on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website. The report sets out how personalised budgets could work as a funding mechanism for people with a disability, providing them with greater choice and control over the services and supports they receive. </p><p>Having reviewed the national and international research evidence and consulted with service users and their families, the report of the Task Force advocates three different models of how personalised budgets might be accessed by people with disabilities:  </p><p>1. Person-managed fund, often referred to as Direct payments; </p><p>2. Co managed with the service provider; and</p><p>3. Broker managed fund.</p><p>The rationale for several models is a recognition of the fact that no two people are the same and therefore, &lsquo;one size does not fit all&rsquo;. The Task Force recommended that the Department of Health and the HSE should establish demonstration projects to test the delivery of personalised budgets. These demonstration projects will test the three models with a view to identifying the best approach to the wider roll-out of these payment models following the initial demonstration phase. </p><p>The Department of Health, NDA and the HSE are in the process of designing the demonstration projects, and the Department&rsquo;s website will be kept updated with information on the roll out of the demonstration projects as it becomes available.</p></reply>

In August, it was replaced by the provider with a relocatable cath lab, operating on the same basis as the mobile cath lab, i.e. it is managed by three diagnostic cardiologists, operates three days per week, and carries out diagnostic cardiology procedures only. The contractual arrangements in place at UHW are for the provision of a unit capable of carrying out diagnostic cardiac procedures only. There are no plans to provide interventional services in the relocatable cath lab. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware that Dr Herity concluded that the needs of the effective catchment population of University Hospital Waterford could be accommodated from a single cath lab and recommended that the operating hours of the existing cath lab, which provides interventional services, should be extended. Approval and funding has been provided for the additional staff required to facilitate this service expansion. Pending the completion of the recruitment process, a mobile/relocatable cath lab has been in place since October 2017 which has improved access and reduced waiting times for patients. </p>  <p>  While the hospital group experienced difficulties recruiting the necessary staff to facilitate the expansion in hours of operation, I am pleased to note that five staff (Grade IV Admin, Porter, Senior Cardiac Physiologist, Senior Radiographer and Staff Nurse) have now been recruited on an 8am to 8pm working day basis. Documentation is also being finalised for the recruitment of a 1 WTE consultant cardiologist required to facilitate the provision of additional operating hours.</p></reply>

However, the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (NASRA) is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.</p>  <p>  Whilst individuals have a right to membership of any trade union, if they choose to join an association which is not recognised by their employer, such membership is not facilitated by their employer.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

However, as you will be aware, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research in October last year, which includes provisions for surrogacy.   </p>  <p>  The specific provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017. These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority. The Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019.</p>  <p>  The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and the process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.</p></reply>

The Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan, published last April outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan places a particular focus on cataract surgery and includes a commitment that the NTPF will provide 5,000 cataract procedures to patients. In addition, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for a cataract procedure.</p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that as of the end of October there were 2 patients waiting for a cataract procedure in Louth County Hospital and Our Lady's of Lourdes Hospital. There is a standard care pathway for patients attending for cataract treatment within the Louth and Drogheda area whereby the patient is assessed by the Community Ophthalmologist, and following assessment, and if deemed to require surgery, are placed directly onto the inpatient/daycase waiting list for cataract surgery at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin.</p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The additional funding provision received has made a significant impact on delayed discharges, reducing them from a high of 832 in October 2014 to a low of 436 in 2016. At the end of 2017 there were 471 delayed discharges. The HSE has reported that, as of 6 November 2018, there are 618 cases of delayed discharges. Following Budget 2019, an additional &euro;10 million has been provided in 2018 to anticipate and manage critical demand pressures on the health service.  The HSE has been requested to prioritise social care measures, with a focus on measures to support older people to transition from acute care to the most appropriate setting.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of years, improving access to home support has been a priority for Government, this can be seen by the way that the home support budget has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to &euro;418 million in 2018. Overall, the 2018 HSE National Service Plan provides for over 17 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time. In addition, a further 156,000 hours, relating to adverse weather funding, were provided from Spring 2018. Intensive Home Care Packages will be delivered to approximately 235 people at any time and will deliver approximately a further 360,000 hours in the full year. Despite this significant level of service provision demand continues to rise.  All those waiting are assessed and provided with a service if appropriate, as soon as possible having regard to their assessed needs. Transitional Care, if appropriate, is arranged through utilising patient and family choice of provider. The total number of transitional care approvals to date in 2018 is 9,595.</p>  <p>  In relation to delayed discharges, I established a working group to undertake an independent expert review of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. This review was requested to focus on the effectiveness and consistency of current data collection, collation and reporting and consider how the measurement and management of delayed discharges could be improved. The report was provided to me on 1st November, and I and my officials will now consider the content of same.</p>  <p>  Discussions between the Department and the Health Service Executive in relation to National Service Planning for next year are well underway.</p></reply>

The Action Plan sets out 25 Actions and Departments responsible for their respective delivery.  A Sponsors Group has recently been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan. This is chaired by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills and comprise five other key Government Departments; Children and Youth Affairs, Justice and Equality; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Business, Enterprise and Innovation; and Health. </p>  <p>  I have made my views and concerns know to several other Ministers and the Taoiseach in relation the effects of cyber bullying and social media generally on mental health. It is a matter for each Department to consider recommendations in the context of the implementation of the Action Plan over 2018-19, and their wider policy remits. Issues collectively relating to tackling posting and removal of harmful material online, possible legislation, or any other relevant issues will be progressed in the context of the work of the Sponsorship Group over the next eighteen months or so.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE recognises the importance of Internet Safety, with several initiatives within the health sector supporting this wider objective. These include Connecting for Life, the National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health, and various other Health and Well-Being actions generally, including promoting positive mental health.</p>  <p>  Connecting for Life, Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to reduce suicide, commits to engaging with online platforms to encourage best practice in reporting around suicidal behaviour, so as to encourage a safer online environment in this area.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government (2016) committed to the establishment of a National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health &ldquo;to consider how best to introduce and teach resilience, coping mechanisms, greater awareness to children and young people, and how to access support services voluntarily at a young age.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Task Force process came to a conclusion last summer and its final set of recommendations were published in December. The recommendations include actions in areas such as consultation and advocacy; awareness and training; accessibility and alignment of mental health services; and improving knowledge through research online youth mental health supports.</p>  <p>  Work in this area is further informed by good practice guidelines for the safe delivery of online mental health information and support commissioned by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in 2015.</p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

In recent years, the spread of inaccurate information on social media concerning the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine has had an impact on uptake rates.  Misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014/15; 72% in 2015/16 to 51% in 2016/17.</p>  <p>  One of the most important things that can be done is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to make a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination.  The HSE National Immunisation Office has developed a comprehensive range of materials for parents, schools and medical practitioners as part of the immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  Each year, at the start of the school term, the HSE runs an awareness campaign for parents to help them access trusted sources of information to encourage them to get their daughters vaccinated with the HPV vaccine.  The HPV vaccine information campaign recommends that parents access trusted sources of information such as the HPV website (hpv.ie) which has been endorsed by the World Health Organization.  The information campaign is supported by social and digital media activity as well as local and national radio advertisements.  I personally spoke at the launch of the 2017 and 2018 HPV vaccine information campaigns and am fully supportive of the valuable work undertaken by the HSE.  From time to time, other HPV campaigns are organised by the HSE using social media (for example, the 2016/17 campaign 'Armed for Life' and 2017/18 campaign 'Protect our Future', both of which were promoted on YouTube).</p>  <p>  Figures provided by the HSE indicate that HPV vaccine uptake rates increased in 2017/18 to 65%.  This increase is mainly due to a comprehensive communications campaign for parents with support from a large number of key stakeholders, e.g. the HPV alliance which currently has 37 organisations working together (such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Marie Keating Foundation).</p>  <p>  While this increase is very welcome, we must continue to work together to get back to where we were once before.  As recently as the 2014/15 academic year the uptake rate for HPV was at 87%.  The HSE vaccination programme for 2018/19 started in September 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government fully supports the HPV immunisation programme and recognises its benefits.  We must continue to focus on increasing uptake rates as the best way of reducing cervical cancer. I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important life-saving vaccine.</p></reply>

All the information provided to parents about vaccination takes account of the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.</p>  <p>  The information is presented in clear and simple language which has been approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency, ensuring that it can be understood by all adults.  The Health Information and Quality Authority guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015), developed in partnership with NALA, states that &ldquo;one in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions&rdquo;.  Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet was replaced by an information leaflet which provides the same information on the potential side effects of the vaccine in a manner that ensures that it is easily understood.</p>  <p>  Prior to all school immunisation, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on all the known potential side effects that can occur after each vaccination (as was the case with the HPV vaccine, Gardasil).  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that parents are being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.  In fact, the HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the website hpv.ie where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the Summary of Products Characteristics and the Patient Information Leaflet for each vaccine can be found.  The HPV website has been endorsed by the World Health Organisation.</p></reply>

In July, I requested the HSE to proceed with next steps on the provision of a modular cath lab at UHW, and to revert to my Department with proposed timescales and costings. </p>  <p>  In early September, the HSE submitted an options appraisal to the Department setting out alternative options for the location and operation of a second cath lab at UHW. Following this, at a meeting with Oireachtas members from the South East, I announced that a second cath lab would be provided at UHW. In late September, upon further examination of the building and service delivery options, the HSE submitted revised costings and a recommended option to the Department. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the project will be reviewed at the next HSE National Capital and Property Steering Committee meeting scheduled for the 13 November 2018.</p>  <p>  The Herity report recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease in UHW to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. I asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. </p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p><p>The 2013 Act requires the HSE to have regard to both the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness but it does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan drugs. It would take an act of the Oireachtas to change the current assessment process for medicines.  However, both the National Centre of Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) and the HSE are mindful of the differences and challenges in terms of patient numbers when assessing this type of medicine.</p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. </p><p>There has been substantial engagement between the Department, the HSE and the NCPE over the last number of months which has resulted in a number of  key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.</p><p><b><i>Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases</i></b></p><p>In June 2018, the HSE leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases which is responsible for:</p><p>1) reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and </p><p>2) providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.</p><p>The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for reimbursement of OMPs are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal or reimbursement process but rather complement it. </p><p>The creation of the Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases is intended to provide a greater balance and transparency to the assessment process.  The inclusion of two public/patient representatives from a selected panel of three is in recognition of the concept that there is a value of opportunity to have patient representation on the Committee.

The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research.</p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is ongoing, and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019. The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and the process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 only encompasses activities which occur in Ireland. The state can only regulate activities that occur in this jurisdiction and cannot regulate people availing of AHR treatment that is legally provided in another country.</p></reply>

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The<i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>(2013) policy document contains a number of recommendations to assist smokers in quitting tobacco use.  In relation to Nicotine Replacement Therapy (&lsquo;NRT&rsquo;) the recommendation is that NRT should be more widely available, including in outlets where tobacco products are sold.  In 2014 the Health Products Regulatory Authority announced that they have licensed some Nicotine Replacement Therapies to be sold in non-pharmacy outlets.  </p><p>Nicotine replacement therapies are already available free of charge to medical card holders.  This approach has been taken on the basis of evidence showing that those in lower income groups have a higher prevalence of smoking than those in higher income groups. There are no plans at present to make NRT available free of charge to the general population.  </p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  There are currently three indications going through the reimbursement system. All had applications made in 2018.</p>  <p>  The NCPE competed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. </p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) be reimbursed for this indication.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) will be reimbursed for each of these indications, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also commissioned a HTA of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.  A full pharmacoeconomic assessment is currently underway by the NCPE. </p></reply>

The HSE's Social Care Directorate and its National Capital and Property Steering Group have accepted recommendations from HSE CHO 1 to retain and upgrade St Joseph&rsquo;s Community Hospital, Stranorlar and Ramelton Community Nursing Unit. This revises the original decision to replace the existing long stay residential beds on both sites as part of the Capital Investment Programme for Public Residential Care Centres for Older People 2016-2021. It further revises the scale of the proposed new unit at Letterkenny from the original 130 beds to 110 beds. Importantly, I understand that the decision to revise the proposals was informed not just by the technical and feasibility studies in relation to the physical infrastructure in these two sites but also on the basis of a broader analysis of population projections and National Planning norms carried out by the HSE.</p>  <p>  I understand that the matter will now proceed through the HSE's capital planning process with design work on the Stranorlar and Ramelton units expected to commence in 2019.

Many women were very concerned and it was vital to examine the facts. That is why the Scoping Inquiry was established, led by Dr Gabriel Scally as an independent expert. The Terms of Reference of the Scoping Inquiry were agreed following cross party engagement and included an examination of the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme.</p>  <p>  Dr Scally provided the Final Report of his Scoping Inquiry in September. His report provided welcome reassurance about the laboratories currently contracted by Cervical Check. He is satisfied with the quality management processes in these labs. </p>  <p>  It is very important to say that Dr Scally confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced. He also stated that continuation of screening in the coming months is of crucial importance. The Government fully agrees with this - screening saves lives. CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland. As stated in the Scally report, the lifetime risk of a woman getting cervical cancer was 1 in 135 in 2015, significantly lower than the lifetime risk in 2007 of 1 in 96. This represents a substantial improvement. </p>  <p>  I therefore very much welcome the fact that Heads of Agreement have been signed between the HSE and the contracted labs to extend their contracts pending the introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening test. This allows for the continuation of the service without interruption. This follows on from detailed and complex negotiations undertaken by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Agreement on the extension of these contracts was reached on the 13th of October. However, this is subject to formal conclusion of the contract, so it would not be appropriate to give any further detail until this process is complete. </p>  <p>  In all of this, it is important to be very clear that false negative results are an inherent part of any cervical screening programme, and do not automatically amount to negligence. Cervical screening will not prevent all screened women from getting cervical cancer although it is important to say that since 2008, 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck. More than 50,000 women with high grade abnormalities (CIN 2 &amp;amp; 3) have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer.</p></reply>

As published each year in the REV, the net pay figure was gross pay less PRD, and the net pensions figure was gross pensions less superannuation contributions.</p>  <p>  In 2019, as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement, PRD will convert to Additional Superannuation Contributions (ASC).  As a result, the net pay figure is effectively the gross pay figure as there is no deduction to be taken.  The ASC is netted off pensions costs instead of pay for the 2019 Health Vote, along with the existing superannuation contributions.</p>  <p>  This explains why the pay figure is significantly increased, and the pension figure significantly decreased for the 2019 Health Vote as laid out on page 2017 of the Budget Expenditure Report. </p></reply>

This Act was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act. It is my intention that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  A number of sections of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child. Commencement of Part 9 of the Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality in consultation with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. However, a number of these sections have to be amended and have yet to be commenced. Commencement of these provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate regulatory and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registration of donor-conceived children.</p></reply>

Commission Implementing Regulation 262/2015 (CR 262/2015), which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the current rules in this regard. This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. 62 of 2016)(as amended). </p>  <p>  CR 262/2015 revoked and replaced Commission Regulation 504/2008, which came into effect on 1st July 2009 and which introduced the requirement for equines to be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner at the time of initial identification. </p>  <p>  Article 12(1) of CR 262/2015 provides that all equine animals must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal, and in any event, before moving permanently from the holding of origin. The passport must generally accompany the equine on movement. </p>  <p>  Under EU rules, equines for which passports were issued with effect from 1st July 2009 must be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner and the number of that microchip must be recorded in the passport of the animal, thereby establishing a link between the animal and its identification document. This information must also be recorded on the database of the Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO) that issued the equine identification document, in conjunction with the Unique Equine Identification Number (UELN) allocated to that equine for its lifetime. All relevant PIO registration data are also recorded my Department's central equine database.</p>  <p>  Equines identified with a passport prior to 1st July 2009 are not required by EU law to be implanted with a microchip. Accordingly, the absence of a microchip in an equine does not necessarily mean that the animal is not identified properly. </p>  <p>  Equine passports are issued by Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) approved by my Department. Information available from these organisations suggest that high rates of compliance with the identification rules are being achieved. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers in my Department who liaise with authorised officers in the Local Authorities and other organisations including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and officers of the Revenue Commissioners, as required. Authorised officers from my Department engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports. These compliance checks are on-going and will continue to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  The presence of a microchip in an equine cannot be established visually. When checking for the presence of a microchip in an equine, it is necessary to physically handle and scan the animal. From a health and safety perspective, this action should only be undertaken by personnel who are competent in the handling of equines. In that regard, where a member of  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requires an equine to be scanned, s/he should liaise with veterinary staff in the relevant Regional Veterinary Offices (RVO) of my Department who will assist in the scanning of the equine. All of the RVOs have sufficient supplies of scanners.</p></reply>

The shareholders are the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, as I have statutory responsibility for certain consent functions under the Forestry Act 1988, it may be defined as a State Body. One of Coillte&rsquo;s principal objectives, under the Forestry Act 1988, is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and it is therefore appropriate, in view of the legislative provisions, to refer to Coillte as a commercial semi-state company.

The company shall, if so required, furnish to me any additional information in respect of that report or in relation to the policy and operations of the company other than day-to-day operations. As a shareholder, I am also represented at the company&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting.</p>  <p>  Coillte is required to confirm to me that it complies with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies in their governance practices and procedures. The Governance Framework outlined in the Code states that the Chairperson and Board are ultimately responsible to me for the operation and proper functioning of the State Body. It should be clarified that this refers to its operations in line with overall Government policy and not day to day operational matters. </p>  <p>  In terms of regulation of its forestry activities, the company is subject to the provisions of the Forestry Act 2014, in the same way as any landowner in the State.</p></reply>

Funding is provided for a range of energy saving measures, and for installing heat pumps. Meanwhile, people in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can avail of free upgrades to their properties, helping them to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a 50% grant is available for a deep energy retrofit. This entails a significant upgrade of a building towards nearly zero energy requirements where it is practically feasible and achievable, including replacing their fossil fuel heating with a renewable system. To receive this grant an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit must be met.</p>  <p>  Over the past two years my Department has, together with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, worked to further highlight the benefits of energy efficiency and fuel switching to homeowners who are primarily using turf and other fossil fuels for their heating needs. Extensive community engagement was undertaken, with the assistance of Irish Rural Link, to promote the grants in areas that have high prevalence of properties reliant on those fuels. </p>  <p>  Whether an applicant to an SEAI scheme is cutting turf on an SAC is not a piece of data that is collected as part of their application and it is not possible therefore to state how many  households in SACs have historically availed of the grant assistance. However, if there are particular counties for which the Deputy would wish to have data on grant payments, this information can be made available.</p>  <p>  The average Government investment per home in 2018 to date is as follows:</p>  <p>  - Better Energy Homes (approx. 30% grant towards specific measures): &euro;1,200 </p>  <p>  - Better Energy Warmer Homes (100% Exchequer funded, measures based on building survey): &euro;6,000</p>  <p>  - Deep Retrofit Pilot (50% grant for achieving BER A3 post retrofit): &euro;25,000 - &euro;30,000.</p></reply>

Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. From January of this year, the Government has made funding available for a grant of up to &euro;600 to support the installation of home charging points; the grant is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. This is available to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Some local authorities have already taken the initiative to provide on street charging infrastructure, and to accelerate this, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging for owners of electric vehicles who rely on on-street parking near their homes.</p>  <p>  The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce Progress Report, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, acknowledges the provision of charging to electric vehicle owners living in apartment blocks or similar residential areas is challenging.  This issue will form part of the Working Group 3 work programme of the Taskforce which includes consideration of planning legislation and building regulations.  The output of this work will determine how best to support the installation of charging in private residential areas where homes do not have dedicated parking adjacent to their dwelling.</p></reply>

It is, therefore, important that robust systems, including assurance on the availability of accurate information on wetlands in Ireland, are in place well in advance of that date.  </p>  <p>  In light of this requirement, the National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, included an action for a cross-Departmental working group, chaired by my Department, to undertake further analysis of the necessary technical steps to prepare for the requirements of the LULUCF Regulation as well as considering any policy implications arising.

The strategy focuses on plastic production and use and sets a goal of ensuring all plastic placed on the EU market will be recyclable by 2030. </p>  <p>  One of the first key legislative proposals to emerge on foot of the EU Plastics Strategy is the &ldquo;Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment&rdquo;, which was published on 28 May 2018. This draft legislation proposes new EU-wide rules to target the 10 most prevalent single-use plastic (SUP) products found on Europe's beaches and seas, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear, which together account for 70% of all marine litter. The proposal includes:</p>  <p>  - Proposed bans on certain SUP products, e.g. cotton buds, plastic cutlery and straws;</p>  <p>  - Obligations on Member States to reduce the use of certain SUPs and for the collection of others; and</p>  <p>  - Obligations on producers of SUP items to cover the costs of waste management and clean up through the establishment of extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the ambition of this proposal throughout and the Council of Ministers recently agreed an ambitious text to bring to negotiations with the European Parliament. I urge all parties to these negotiations to reach agreement as soon as possible in order to give Member States the ability to introduce this important legislation. </p>  <p>  I intend to commission a comprehensive national study to identify the means to achieve the higher proposed targets, complementary to the existing, successful collection system that we could implement to reduce the use of plastics and increase the level of plastic recycling.</p></reply>

NTA reported at the end of October 2018 that there were 26,310 SPSV drivers licensed to provide hire and reward services nationwide. 2018 sees a reversal of the decline in numbers of drivers in the fleet experienced for many years, with October showing the eighth consecutive monthly increase in those numbers.</p>  <p>  In the last year, there has been an increase of 59% per month in the average number of new SPSV Driver Licences granted.  This increase is linked, in particular, with NTA bringing in changes to the SPSV Driver Entry Test, launching a national taxi driver a recruitment campaign earlier this year, and continuing to assist prospective drivers and licensed rental companies with grants towards the cost of wheelchair accessible vehicles </p>  <p>   As you may know, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial issue for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Following the publication of the Department of Finance Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance last year, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland and both parties have agreed that there should be ongoing engagement between them.  I believe that this will be an important channel to ensure that the concerns of taxi drivers can be articulated and addressed.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is no doubt aware, under EU legislation there are provisions to permit the free movement of goods between Member States.  This free movement allows European citizens greater consumer choice. Construction standards for vehicles are also set at EU level and on an EU-wide basis.</p>  <p>  Without commenting on the emissions profile of any individual imported vehicle or class of vehicles; the progressive &lsquo;dieselisation&rsquo; of our national car fleet over the past decade and its impact on air quality is a matter for concern. There are a range of incentives in place, many of which were introduced by this Government, to encourage consumers to transition away from all conventionally fuelled vehicles towards lower-emitting alternatives.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2019 that from 1st January 2019 a new 1% surcharge on VRT will be levied on all newly registered diesel cars, including those imported into Ireland.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there is an important role to be played by improving efficiency standards for vehicles at  European level.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicle standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that carbon emissions generated by vehicles can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.</p></reply>

The reason for this is public safety - where licences are exchangeable, it is because we are satisfied that they are based on testing to a standard comparable to our own, either because they are EU driving licences or because they are licences issued by a jurisdiction with which we have an agreement on licence exchange based on detailed study which shows that the two regimes are comparable.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many who take up residence here with non-exchange driving licences find this system lengthy, costly, and frustrating.  The principal source of both cost and time is the requirement to undertake 12 Essential Driver Training (EDT) lessons.  Following discussions with the Road Safety Authority and with my colleague Minister Ciaran Cannon, Minister for the Diaspora, I decided that people in this situation should be offered a reduced EDT of only 6 lessons.  I have now signed into law the necessary regulations.  As there will need to be a lead-in time for the RSA and driving instructors, the new measures will come into effect from 21 January 2019.</p></reply>

Until recently, one exception existed within this arrangement, namely ECCE Higher Capitation, a &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; capitation fee within the ECCE programme, providing additional funding to Early Years services which are led by graduates of Early Childhood Education and Care degrees. While payments were processed by Pobal, the application and processing of ECCE Higher Capitation was still carried out by this Department. While my officials endeavoured to make this process as straightforward as possible, it was considered that this two-stage process, involving two administrative entities, was cumbersome for Early Years&rsquo; service providers. It had long been the intention of this department to transfer administration of the ECCE programme as a whole to Pobal, allowing for an improvement in efficiency.</p>  <p>  On 30 July 2018 an official announcement was made that Pobal would be the administrator of ECCE Higher Capitation payments on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth (DCYA) with effect from the commencement of the 2018/2019 programme year.</p>  <p>  Pobal opened the application process for the ECCE Higher Capitation 2018/2019 on 28 September 2018, via Pobal's online portal system. </p>  <p>  The date of payments of the ECCE Higher Capitation rate will be individual to each service on approval of a fully completed application. Once an application has been approved by Pobal, they will pay services the ECCE Higher Capitation rate and any arrears due to them on the next available payment date.</p>  <p>  In migrating ECCE Higher Capitation to Pobal, the DCYA completed the process of transitioning full administration of the ECCE programme to Pobal. Early Years providers are also now able to conduct all business relating to the ECCE programme with one agent, using the same system already in place to conduct all of their business relating to DCYA Early Years programmes, and have the full benefit of the resources that Pobal already bring to the Early Years sector.   </p>  <p>  Pobal endeavour to have applications processed within one month of receiving a Higher Capitation application.  A delay may occur if more information is required from the service provider to fully process the application. Pobal has received an unprecedented number of applications for ECCE Higher Capitation so far in this programme year. I am very pleased to see that more Early Years&rsquo; services are becoming eligible for ECCE Higher Capitation, and my officials anticipate that this will represent over half of all Early Years&rsquo; services by the end of the programme year. </p>  <p>  Officials from the DCYA and Pobal are already in dialogue around ensuring efficient roll out of the Higher Capitation payments in the 2019/2020 programme year, including opening ECCE Higher Capitation for applications in advance of September 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to the LINC (AIM Level 1) payments, Pobal has received 1,225 applications to date for the increased Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) capitation in relation to LINC.  Of the applications received 92% have been processed with 89% of the total successfully awarded funding so far.  Of these, 97% have received a payment in relation to LINC for this programme year to date.</p></reply>

It is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for either BTEA or CE, a number of conditions including age and being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specific period must be met.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services to unemployed persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. These include advice on job-search activities, the use of online job search tools in Intreo Centres nationally, upskilling opportunities through Educational Training Boards (ETBs), Springboard and Skillnet courses. Persons signing for credits for six months or more can also participate on ETB-run VTOS courses, subject to availability. In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by my Department are focused, in the first instance, on this cohort of unemployed people who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and I have no plans to change the existing criteria. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind perhaps he would contact my Department with details.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  It has been and remains the case that any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance scheme, to include people on short term payment schemes, would require considerable extra funding for the scheme and would have to be considered in overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I would again highlight payments available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Payments include a heating supplement payment, a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for this payment.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs. </p>  <p>  An exceptional needs payment may also be made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This payment can be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy or anyone else is aware of someone who does not qualify for Fuel Allowance as a result of short-term unemployment, but whose financial position is that they require such assistance, he should advise that person to contact their Community Welfare Officer. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It contained a number of measures to amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, a number of specific measures relating to defined benefit pension schemes and amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004. </p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, including provisions relating to defined benefit pension schemes. A key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members' pension benefits. However, it is essential that any new measures recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p>  <p>  The defined benefit pensions provisions are very technical and involved complex policy issues. In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy. When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. </p>  <p>  In the meantime two largely technical elements of that were published as part of the 2017 Bill are now being brought forward as part of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018. These provisions provide for the implementation of administrative efficiencies. The first is a measure is to allow positive decisions i.e. decisions to award a social welfare benefit or payment to a claimant, to be made by an automated information system. The second is a measure to dispense with the practice of asking General Practitioners to distinguish between employment of a rehabilitative nature and work more generally for the purposed of Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and certain supplements under Supplementary Welfare Allowance. </p>  <p>  There is also a technical amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004 which was to be part of the 2017 Bill. This is now being brought forward as part of the 2018 Bill. This is a technical provision concerning the terms of office of an t&Aacute;rd Chl&aacute;raitheoir (Registrar General) and an t&Aacute;rd Chl&aacute;raitheoir Cunta (Deputy Registrar General).</p>  <p>   I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  The rural social scheme (RSS) provides farmers and fishermen with income support while they also make a contribution to their communities.</p>  <p>  The CE scheme has a budget to support approximately 21,900 participant places in 2018 and 21,500 places in 2019. At the end of October, there was a total of 21,243 participants on the scheme. This leaves a total of 657 budgeted vacancies this year. </p>  <p>  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups (known as sponsors) wishing to benefit the local community.  My Department agrees participant numbers annually with each CE sponsor organisation who are responsible for the recruitment of participants and for identifying suitable work placements. CE sponsors can promote their scheme vacancies within their local communities.  </p>  <p>  At a local level, various methods of promoting CE have been arranged between my Department and local schemes, including targeting potentially eligible jobseekers to attend a CE Job-fair, where details of CE vacancies and employment opportunities are provided.</p>  <p>  In addition, CE sponsors can advertise their vacancies free of charge on the Department's JobsIreland website, www.jobsireland.ie.  The process of posting vacancies is relatively straightforward and a tailored video is available online to assist sponsors.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome increase in the number of people at work and the continued reduction in Live Register numbers is a factor in recruitment to all work programmes.  While participation on CE and T&uacute;s is a stepping stone back to employment, these positions are not full-time sustainable jobs.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that I have implemented a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability to a greater number of people on the Live Register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on a programme. </p>  <p>  The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to re-qualify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded. There is an overall limit of 6 years participation from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  Since 1st June, I am also facilitating persons to take up a placement on CE or T&uacute;s while also attending their JobPath provider.</p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the standard duration of participation on work schemes and it is considered that the existing durations are adequate to meet the programmes objectives. </p>  <p>  Any IB or sponsor organisation who has any recruitment concerns should contact their nearest Intreo Centre who will provide assistance.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

First, we have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to the customer enquiries.  Second, we have developed some new IT routines or &lsquo;workarounds&rsquo; that address the payment gap issues and to ensure a faster flow-through to payments.  Third, we are reviewing the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.</p>  <p>  Payment volumes were restored to normal levels last week and my officials are monitoring them on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at this level.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years (previously it was 65 for those qualified for a contributory pension, and 66 for those who were paid a non-contributory pension).  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.</p>  <p>  It is well known that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include: </p><p>- The Wage Subsidy Scheme, which is targeted at private sector employers, to encourage the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives.</p><p>- The EmployAbility service, which is a specialist service (delivered under a contract arrangement in 23 locations around the country on behalf of the department) that works with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  The service supports people with disabilities through the provision of dedicated job coach support.  This service provides both pre-employment and in employment supports and assistance.  </p><p>- The &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; programme provides funding (via Pobal) to 27 organisations being funded to support young people (aged 15-29) with disabilities to move closer to the labour market through the provision of a range of person-centred supports.  The programme  will see some 2,600 young people with disabilities being supported over the next three years.</p><p>- A range of other employment support grants for people with disabilities are also provided, under the Reasonable Accommodation Fund. The reasonable accommodation fund is a demand-led scheme, expenditure arises in response to applications received. The fund is comprised of the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and the Employee Retention Grant.</p><p>- The department also funds two AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) programmes  1) the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme and 2) the &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; programme which are designed as employment support programmes for graduates with disabilities. </p><p>- The  Department also provides the Partial Capacity Benefit payment for those with a reduced capacity to work.  </p><p>Under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Department is progressively developing and improving its Intreo service for people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, the Jobseeker (person with a disability) who seeks support from their local Intreo Centre will have a meeting arranged with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan and in order to access the full range of supports available.</p><p>Expenditure in 2017 on these schemes and supports are set out in tabular form, below.<table><tr><th>Support / Scheme</th><th>Expenditure (estimate, 2017    unless otherwise   stated)</th></tr><tr><td>Wage Subsidy Scheme</td><td>&euro;25.9 million</td></tr><tr><td>EmployAbility Service</td><td>&euro;9.8 million</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>&euro;14.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Reasonable Accommodation Fund</td><td>&euro;0.1 million</td></tr><tr><td>Ability Programme</td><td>&euro;16 million (from 2018, over three years)</td></tr><tr><td>AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and     Disability) incl. the Get Ahead and Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programmes</td><td>&euro;0.3 million</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In certain circumstances, if a person is not eligible for other social welfare payments and their weekly income is below the SWA rate for their family size, a payment may be made to bring their income up to the appropriate SWA rate.  The Community Welfare Service (CWS) officer will engage with a claimant to establish eligibility as quickly as possible and limit any delay to payments.  If there is a specific risk of homelessness, this should be communicated to the CWS officer at the earliest opportunity.  </p>  <p>  Staff in the Department are engaged with customers throughout the entire lifecycle of their claim, including on regular reviews for all schemes on an ongoing basis.  A person&rsquo;s entitlement to a social welfare payment is reviewed on a continuing basis to ensure that they continue to satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  A person&rsquo;s means may also be reviewed from time to time.  A customer may also request a review of their means in the light of changed circumstances at any time. </p>  <p>  Review decisions are not delayed unnecessarily once all the information requested from the customer at the time of review is made available to my Department.  Payments are not suspended unless there is a valid reason for doing so, for example the provision of insufficient information by the customer in response to a query, or no reply from the customer.  Undue hardship for customers should not arise if there is ongoing co-operation from the customer with the Deciding Officer/Designated Person in my Department.     </p>  <p>  Continued entitlement to a rent supplement payment from the Department is not linked to entitlement to other social welfare schemes.  However, the rent supplement claim may be reviewed following a decision to suspend or disallow a primary social welfare payment as there may be a change to the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances that could affect eligibility.  During a review of a rent supplement claim, the CWS officers will engage with a claimant to establish continued eligibility as quickly as possible and limit any delay to payments.  </p>  <p>  Any person in this situation is encouraged to contact the Department&rsquo;s CWS office responsible for their rent supplement claim to discuss their circumstances.  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to a basic weekly SWA payment should contact the CWS at their local Intreo centre.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of a particular case, he should bring the details to the attention of the Department and my officials will follow up on them.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

One of these is the State pension (contributory), qualification for which is based on a number of criteria, including that a minimum of 520 qualifying contributions have been paid into the Social Insurance Fund.  For those who have paid the required contributions at a reckonable rate &ndash; including Class S (self-employed) - they will be used in the calculation of their entitlements.  </p>  <p>  I believe that it is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it.  </p>  <p>  Where a person aged 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a State pension (contributory), or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following - </p>  <p>  The means-tested State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC; or   </p>  <p>  An increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension where their spouse has a contributory pension; or</p>  <p>  Where their spouse/civil partner is deceased, a widow's/widower's/civil partner's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse's or their own social insurance record.  The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the State pension (contributory), and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over is &euro;243.30, i.e. the same as the maximum rate of the SPC, with allowances (notably the Living Alone Allowance) payable where applicable.</p>  <p>  Refunds of PRSI arise when contributions from employers and employees have been paid in error.  There are a number of reasons why a person might be paying the wrong PRSI rate, the most common of which is where an employee over 66 working and continuing to pay PRSI, where there is no requirement to do so.</p>  <p>  Another case is contributors, who enter insurable employment, either as employees or self-employed, after they have attained the age of 56.  If they have no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory or Non Contributory) then the pension element of the contributions paid by both employed and self-employed contributors may be refunded. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In advance of this, on 23 January last, the Government agreed to allow pensioners, born on or after the 1st September 1946, affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, to have their state pension (contributory) entitlement calculated under an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA).  The changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or individuals who needed increased levels of care.  </p>  <p>  The changes apply to those who reached pension age on or after 1st September 2012  who were awarded less than maximum rate, on post Budget 2012 rate bands.  The changes do not apply to anyone already entitled to maximum rate state pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  Currently there are approximately 79,000 pensioners in this category and my Department is now in the process of issuing Information Letters to them.</p>  <p>  Work on examination of the social insurance records of the pensioners concerned commenced in September.  As social insurance records are unique to individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  To date, over sixty temporary staff members have been recruited to work on this phase.  Further recruitment will take place in January 2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way and it is anticipated that the first review outcomes will be notified to pensioners during Quarter 1 2019.   </p>  <p>  Payment of increases, where awarded, will be made immediately after an individual's review is completed.  If a pensioner does not qualify for an increased rate, they will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures on the numbers of applications that it has received since the scheme began and also the number of applications it has assessed and recommended for approval.  The most recent figures, as at the end of October, indicate that the Agency has received a total of 3,309 applications for assessment since the scheme launched in February.  Of these, 619 were deemed invalid, while the assessment of 107 other applications was still in progress.  Of the remainder, 1,317 applications have been recommended for approval by the Housing Agency. </p><p>Each local authority must have in place a credit committee and it is a matter for the committee to make the decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the regulations, having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p><p>Regarding timeframes from the point of application to approval under the scheme, recent requests to local authorities for initial data on timeframes for application processing within their area has found that it takes an average time of <i>circa</i>seven weeks from submitting a completed application to a local authority to receiving approval under the scheme, which is in line with the expected timeframe of 6-8 weeks as set out on the RIHL website.  Approvals are valid for six months to allow applicants time to source a property to purchase.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.  Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains central in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the overarching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation, including the issues referred to, has been undertaken.  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  I hope to be in a position to publish the review shortly, following completion of consideration of a number of implementation issues arising.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its non-domestic customers in receipt of water services provided by it in accordance with a Water Charges Plan, to be approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Water customers are broadly classified as domestic and non-domestic customers. Water charges no longer apply to domestic customers of Irish Water with the exception of legal provision for charges in respect of excessive use.  In relation to non-domestic customers, the Water Charges Plan currently in operation states that a non-domestic premises, &ldquo;means a Premises in which Water Services are used for Non-Domestic Purposes, defined in the Water Services Act 2007 as (a) agriculture or horticulture, (b) any trade, industry or business, (c) any purpose incidental to a household or private garden if the water is drawn otherwise than from a tap inside the household or if a hosepipe or other similar apparatus is used, (d) central heating other than the central heating of a household; (e) apparatus depending while in use upon a supply of continuously running water, not being an apparatus used solely for heating water.&rdquo;  In accordance with the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017, therefore, all water services supplied by Irish Water to non-domestic premises used for the provision of short term accommodation, such as B&amp;Bs, hotels and self-catering accommodation, may be subject to a charge in line with the current Water Charges Plan applied by Irish Water.</p></reply>

This was followed by the publication for consultation by Dublin City Council of a detailed planning scheme for the area.  The Council prepared a draft planning scheme which was considered by the elected members of the Council in May 2017.  As a statutory consultee for that process, my Department highlighted the importance of the planning scheme, addressing a variety of housing needs and relevant matters.</p>  <p>  I and my Department remain committed to working with the City Council, any relevant approved housing bodies (AHBs) and either the receiver and/or developers of the SDZ area in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order of magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme, but subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value for money aspects.</p>  <p>  It is my Department's understanding that the receiver is engaging with Dublin City Council with a view to advancing an approach that would both better enable the orderly development of this strategic but complex city location and to assist in delivering much needed additional social housing.  My Department stands ready to support such initiatives, subject to observance of all the normal value-for-money, procurement and wider legal aspects. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the Poolbeg SDZ planning scheme.

The successful bid was by Adwood Ltd, a consortium of established Dublin builders Adroit and Maplewood.  Adwood Ltd. will make a financial payment to the Council and deliver 294 social housing units at competitive rates over four years.</p>  <p>  As much of the master planning and pre-planning studies have been completed, Adwood Ltd. has committed to securing planning and being on site by early summer of 2019. This project is being led by South Dublin County Council directly. State support of &euro;2m is being provided by my Department through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), on foot of which the developer has committed to deliver 50 units at prices discounted to the market.</p>  <p>  In general, for the Social Housing PPP Programme of 3 Bundles of sites that is currently under procurement by my Department, there are robust governance arrangements put in place to oversee implementation. These follow guidelines as set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  For each PPP Programme there is a Sanctioning Authority, and in the case of the Social Housing PPP programme, my Department fulfils that role. The Sanctioning Authority is responsible for approving expenditure on the programme. A Sponsoring Agency is also appointed which prepares the Output Specification, the Public Sector Benchmark, which is an assessment of cost of delivering the project through traditional public sector means and in the initial stages ensures that the project is in line with the budget specified.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Social Housing PPP programme the leading local authority with the greatest number of projects in each bundle is given the task of acting as the Sponsoring Agency on behalf of all the local authorities involved. In the case of Bundle 1 the Sponsoring Agency is Dublin City Council (DCC), and for Bundle 2 this role is being undertaken by Cork County Council (CCC). A Sponsoring Agency will be nominated for Bundle 3 once the potential sites for that Bundle are identified. </p>  <p>  The National Development Finance Agency acts as financial advisers to the programme and is also responsible for the procurement and administration of the PPP up to completion of the project and handover to the relevant local authority. A Process Auditor is appointed for each Bundle and is responsible for checking that proper procedures and processes have been followed and providing assurance to the Accounting Officer of the Department that the procedures have been adhered to.</p>  <p>  As part of the governance arrangements each Bundle has a Project Board which is made up of representatives from the Sanctioning Authority, the Sponsoring Agency, the other relevant local authorities, and the NDFA. It is responsible for providing the leadership to keep the project on track and to maintain governance over what is a complex process. It is also responsible for determining at each stage whether the Project continues to constitute value for money and whether it can proceed to the next stage, subject to the agreement of the Sanctioning Authority.</p>  <p>  In addition, councillors in each local authority must agree to grant planning approval for each PPP development based on the initial designs as drawn up by the project's advisors in conjunction with local authority officials. The Part 8 planning process used for this purpose involves a vote being taken on each individual site by the relevant council, following the publication of the plans by the local authority.</p>  <p>  Securing value for money (VfM) is an overarching concern throughout the PPP procurement process and the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance in relation to PPP projects to achieve this objective. The guidance sets out four specific VfM tests that are applied in the case of PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process. These tests focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result. The purpose, sequence and format of the four VfM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidelines.</p>  <p>  The first VfM test is carried out when the preliminary appraisal of a Programme is being undertaken. This initial analysis assesses whether the programme has potential to deliver through the PPP model and achieve value for money.</p>  <p>  The second test includes the preparation of the comprehensive Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) by the NDFA, which represents the full estimated life costs of procuring the project using traditional public sector procurement methods. All inputs used in the compilation of the PSB are reviewed and approved by the Department.  The Contracting Authority (DCC or CCC) then compiles the second VfM test, which uses the costings in the PSB to confirm that the project should still proceed as a PPP, and that the additional cost of private finance is justified. This was undertaken and approved by the Department in December 2017 for Bundle 1, and July 2018 for Bundle 2.</p>  <p>  The third VfM test involves confirming that the tender that rated highest in the tender evaluation process has the potential to achieve value for money for the State. This is done by comparing the cost of the highest-rated tender to the PSB. This was completed in September 2018 for Bundle 1, which led to the appointment of the Preferred Tenderer, and will be completed for Bundle 2 in due course.</p>  <p>  The fourth test is undertaken immediately before financial close and the signing of the PPP contract. This updates the third VfM test with any changes that may have occurred during the Preferred Tender stage of the procurement process, in order to confirm that the winning bid continues to represent Value for Money.</p></reply>

Taking in charge is an iterative process and the number of developments in any given local authority area is subject to ongoing change as new developments commence, while other developments progress and move towards the completion phase, and then become the subject of applications to be taken in charge under Section 180 of the Act. </p><p>My Department does not hold current data on a year to year basis regarding developments that are to be taken in charge and such data is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>However, an initial national baseline survey carried out in December 2015 indicated that, in respect of County Tipperary, there were 295 developments that were not in the charge of the local authority at that time and that 96 of these were the subject of a valid taking in charge application. </p><p>Details of this initial baseline survey are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>On foot of this initial survey, my Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the process for taking-in-charge housing estates.  Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for funding for demonstration projects to inform the development of proposals for streamlining of the taking-in-charge process. </p><p>Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of the taking in charge of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes and this funding mechanism is now closed.  Tipperary received &euro;521,296 in funding for 15 developments, all of which have since been taken in charge.  </p><p>Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process will be included in a report, which my Department intends to publish shortly and which I believe will be of considerable value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot programme in a more general roll-out of a more streamlined approach to taking-in-charge.  The report will provide an update of the data for 2018 and it is anticipated that it will demonstrate a substantial reduction in the number of developments remaining to be taken in charge within County Tipperary.</p><p>Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act.</p></reply>

If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Act requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  Indeed, section 160 of the Act provides that anyone may seek a court order in relation to unauthorised development; such action is not restricted to planning authorities.</p><p>While my Department keeps planning legislation under regular review, I am satisfied that planning authorities have sufficient enforcement powers at their disposal under the existing legislation and I have no plans to amend the provisions at this time.</p></reply>

A hearing in the case took place in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on 19 September 2018.  Ireland made a number of key points including the burden of proof, the use of out of date information by the Commission and the exceptional circumstances arising from the significant contraction in the Irish economy which occurred between 2007 and 2010, all of which were contested by the Commission. </p><p>The Court&rsquo;s written judgement is expected within six months of the Court hearing. At that point Ireland will engage comprehensively with the Commission and agree work programmes to ensure full compliance with the Directive within timelines considered satisfactory by the Commission. </p><p>The recent EPA report on urban waste water treatment in Ireland has found that, out of the 179 Large Urban Areas in Ireland, 28 areas failed to comply with the EU&rsquo;s legally binding standards for the treatment of urban waste water in 2017.  Over the period 2016&ndash;2024, capital upgrades and operational improvement works will have been completed or undertaken at all of these urban waste-water treatment plants to ensure that treatment levels and capacity comply with the requirements of the UWWTD.  Substantial State funding is being provided for this purpose under the National Development Plan under Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>This investment reflects the objectives of the River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 which outlines what Ireland is doing to protect and improve our waters.  Among a broad suite of measures the Plan provides for &euro;1.7 billion of investment by Irish Water in 255 urban wastewater projects which are designed to achieve compliance with the UWWTD.  Of the urban areas where works are required, the majority will be compliant by end 2021, including Ringsend which is the single largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, accounting for 41% of the total wastewater load.</p><p>Irish Water has developed a long term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and wastewater system.  It is optimising investment decisions to ensure that they deliver the best possible improvements for the communities concerned.</p><p>I approved the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024, without modification,<i></i>on 7 November 2018.  This sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic funding requirement of &euro;11 billion to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1 billion investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.  The Strategic Funding Plan outlines the costs and revenue requirements associated with the implementation of Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP), the first of which was published in 2015 and the first ever Water Services Policy Statement which I published on 21 May 2018.  This funding requirement will be met through a combination of non-domestic revenue, excess usage charges, government subvention, non-domestic borrowings and capital contributions. The Plan will be subject to economic regulatory review by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities as part of its third regulatory control period 2020-2024.</p></reply>

The objective is to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives contained in local authority development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The working group comprised three senior officials from the Planning Division of my Department and six senior officials from the Planning Divisions of local authorities nominated by the Local Government Management Agency.

It may be possible to finalise the Guidelines earlier than that, subject to the completion of outstanding work.</p>  <p>  Further, the National Planning Framework (NPF), published under Project Ireland 2040, sits at the top of the planning policy hierarchy in Ireland and provides a structure for future development and investment over the next two decades.  This national level planning policy is being implemented at the regional level through preparation of statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) for the three Regional Assembly areas.  </p>  <p>  The RSES process formally commenced earlier this year and the draft Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly RSES is now on public display until 23 January 2019.  The two other draft RSESs (Northern and Western Regional Assembly and Southern Regional Assembly), subject to Regional Assembly approval, are expected to be put on public display in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The finalisation of these regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will in turn prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish updated Development Plans: Guidelines for Planning Authorities in 2019 to assist planning authorities in the implementation of the NPF at the regional and local levels.  This will include updated Core Strategy guidance which will guide planning authorities in implementing effective and appropriate core strategies within their city/county areas.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each elected Council to decide its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. </p>  <p>  Section 45(5) of the Local Government Act 2001 states that a local authority may, by standing orders, regulate the right of members of the public and members of the media to be present at meetings.  This includes the making of rules in relation to recording or relaying the proceedings as they take place or at a later stage. </p>  <p>  It is therefore a matter for the elected members of each local authority to decide in the first instance to webcast local authority meetings and then to allocate sufficient funding from their annual budget for the provision of such facilities.</p>  <p>  My Department, however, recognises the potential in the use of technology to strengthen local democracy, leadership and governance.  At its meeting of 27 September 2018, the Government approved the policy paper "Local Authority Leadership, Governance and Administration", prepared as part of the response to the Programme for Partnership Government commitment to report to Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, which identifies that action in the area of e-Democracy and e-Governance warrants consideration.  This policy paper has been forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Housing, Planning and Local Government for its consideration. </p></reply>

The group's aim is to recommend measures to ensure an equality of outcome between those who receive water services from Irish Water and non-Irish Water customers.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide for a two-strand approach.  Strand 1 is considering the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021.  Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector.</p>  <p>  The Working Group is currently finalising a report to me on Strand 1 of its deliberations.  This report will make recommendations on the measures to be funded for the next cycle of the Rural Water Programme.  Following my consideration of these recommendations, I expect to announce details of the programme priorities and the invitation to submit bids should issue to local authorities before year end.</p></reply>

Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  Class 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption from planning permission for the extension of a house, by the construction or erection of an extension (including a conservatory) to the rear of the house or by the conversion for use as part of the house of any garage, store, shed or other similar structure attached to the rear or to the side of the house. This exemption applies where the house has not been extended previously, and where the floor area of any such extension does not exceed 40 square metres. The exemption is subject to compliance with a number of other conditions and limitations and also any general restrictions on exemptions.</p>  <p>  There is a balance, in providing for exemptions from planning permission, between streamlining the consent process for minor works and supporting proper planning and sustainable development, including the need to ensure adequate third party participation rights. While all aspects of the existing regime for exempted development are kept under on-going monitoring and review, I have no plans to amend this particular exemption at this time.</p></reply>

To ensure a local-led response to such work, responsibility for property acquisitions is delegated to local authorities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are encouraged to adopt a proactive approach in utilising their available legislative powers for compulsory purchase, where necessary, with the aim of bringing the greatest number of recoverable long term vacant dwellings back into the liveable housing stock.  In many cases, however, the use of CPO powers is not necessary as agreement to purchase can be reached between the local authority and the property owner. To assist local authorities in pursuing vacant properties, my Department introduced the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme to facilitate them in acquiring and remediating vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. Through this support mechanism, local authorities have delivered almost 200 social housing units to date and I am keen to see further delivery in this way. </p>  <p>  As with standard acquisitions, local authorities have delegated responsibility to utilise the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme, as part of the blend of property acquisitions, as appropriate to their area, given housing need and the availability of properties of different types.  </p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018.  </p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund nationally in 2018. The Structures at Risk Fund will be revamped for 2019 and will become the Historic Structures Fund. The Fund will open for applications shortly, together with the Built Heritage Investment Scheme for 2019. </p><p>Details of these funding schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites. A list of projects approved for funding is also published on the Department's website.</p><p>I have also provided funding of &euro;1m in 2018 for the Historic Towns Initiative, which is a joint initiative of my Department and the Heritage Council. This initiative is supporting six historic towns in 2018 who are carrying out significant heritage regeneration projects. </p><p>The best advice for owners in relation to individual historic structures is generally to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer in their local authority who is well placed to provide expert advice and assistance. </p><p>In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of Project Ireland 2040. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website <i>www.heritagecouncil.ie</i>.</p><p><b>Projects funded in Longford and Westmeath</b></p><p><b><i>The Structures at Risk Fund - 2018  </i></b><table><tr><th>Local  Authority</th><th>Site Name, Address</th><th>Grant</th></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>Clondra Lockhouse, Old Strokestown Road, Clondra,   Co.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-13a.1654.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300097#WRJJ01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 656 to 659, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The relocation of turf cutters from raised bog special areas of conservation to non-designated bogs is one of the options being pursued to address their needs, as set out in the National Plan.</p>  <p>   58 applications under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received from turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation, County Kildare. Of these 58 applicants, 9 have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.</p>  <p>  The process involved in relocating these turf cutters to the non-designated Coolree Bog involves:</p>  <p>  i. An assessment of the site as regards turf quality and quantity; </p>  <p>  ii. Establishing the number that can be accommodated there;</p>  <p>  iii. Engaging in land purchase negotiations and the conclusion of a contract for sale; </p>  <p>  iv. An application for planning permission; and</p>  <p>  v. The completion of infrastructure and drainage works on the site, subject to the securing of planning permission.</p>  <p>  Prior to relocation to Coolree Bog, the turf cutters will be required to enter into a legal agreement with myself, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. This legal agreement will grant each turf cutter a turbary right on a plot within Coolree Bog on which he or she may exercise the right to cut turf until the turf is exhausted. Each plot of bog will be comprised of not less than 1 acre of high bog together with an area of spread ground. </p>  <p>  To date, my Department has spent approximately &euro;103,000 progressing the relocation of cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme applicants from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation to the non-designated Coolree Bog. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the upper limit of the total quantity of peat that is expected to be removed as a result of turf cutting at Coolree Bog  is 175,500m3. The estimated carbon loss from the 175,500m3 of peat to be removed is calculated as 35,398 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). </p>  <p>  Over the estimated operational lifetime of the relocation site, total carbon loss equates to 545 tCO2eq per annum. That is equivalent to the annual emissions of 43 people in Ireland (based on a per capita emission of 12.57 tCO2eq per annum).</p>  <p>  Coolree Bog is an already degraded site.  The relocation of turf cutters to Coolree Bog is to replace the activity at Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation, which is a more sensitive site. My Department intends to carry out restoration measures at Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation and this work will result in improving the carbon sink capabilities within that designated site.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of the qualifying cessation of turf cutting compensation applicants from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation are being provided with financial compensation under this scheme. My Department is only seeking to relocation a small fraction of these applicants. This is in line with my aim to address the needs of turf cutters as part of an overall raised bog designated network solution, as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. This involves a balance of protecting traditional rights, providing compensation where these rights are curtailed and seeking to facilitate feasible alternatives where possible, while working to ensure that Ireland meets its legal obligations, in accordance with the EU Habitats Directive.</p></reply>

This scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. </p><p>While applicants are waiting for relocation sites to be investigated, prepared and developed, they may, on an interim basis, opt for the annual payment or opt to receive an annual supply of up to 15 tonnes of cut turf delivered to their homes and to the homes of other individuals who had been sourcing turf from the bog plot in question, where applicable. </p><p>For certain special area of conservation sites, where applicants have continued to apply for relocation and that has not been feasible, the 15 year compensation  (less any interim annual payments or the value of turf deliveries received) has been made available to them in the form of a lump sum to enable them to source and purchase bog plots themselves.</p><p>Just over 2,300 qualifying applicants from special areas of conservation have been provided with payments under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme amounting to  &euro;25.4 million.  The estimated cost of the provision of payments over the lifetime of this 15 year scheme is in the region of &euro;54.1 million. </p><p>1,075 deliveries of turf have been made at a the cost of just over &euro;2.1 million. The estimated cost of turf deliveries in respect of applicants under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is &euro;3.15 million.</p><p>476 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.

I can, however, inform the Deputy that I launched a policy document entitled Gender Equality in Practice in Irish Theatre on the 9th July 2018. The policy document  was crafted to encompass the individual workings and requirements of ten theatre organisations and were a result of one and half year&rsquo;s work. </p><p>Gender Equality in Practice in Irish Theatre began after #WakingTheFeminists drew attention to the gender inequality that then existed within Irish theatre. This cultural phenomenon encouraged the participating theatre organisations to consider their own record in programming and supporting women within the sector and identify processes that would ensure gender parity and dignity at work in the future.</p><p>Each gender policy statement has been ratified by the boards of the organisations and each organisation has undertaken to measure their progress against their published targets on an annual basis using the #WakingTheFeminists Gender Counts guidelines.</p><p>Included in the list of measures are the following</p><p>1. Gender blind readings for plays</p><p>2. Unconscious bias training for all staff</p><p>3. Achieve equality of gender of board members</p><p>4. 50% of new play commissions to be allocated to women writers</p><p>5. Gender blind casting</p><p>6. Addition of Dignity at Work clauses to employees charter</p><p>7. Re-examination of the female canon</p><p>8. Work with third level institutions to encourage gender parity in areas that do not reflect equality of gender.</p><p>9. To achieve gender balance in programming within a 5 year period.</p><p>Up to 10 theatre companies are involved in the working group have come together to demonstrate the power of collaboration within the Cultural sector in Ireland, to share expertise, support and learnings and enhance the possibilities for women in the Irish theatre sector.</p><p>I am glad also to be able to advise the Deputy that in  2017, the Arts Council supported research commissioned by Waking the Feminists (Gender Counts &ndash; an analysis  of  gender  in  Irish  theatre  2006-2015), and this work continues to inform the Council&rsquo;s decisions. Separately, the Arts Council is in the final stages of developing a comprehensive Equality, Human Rights and Diversity policy, which considers gender as one of 10 grounds for potential discrimination and inequity. During the course of developing that policy the Arts Council met with several representative groups from civil society and arts gender advocacy groups such as Sounding the Feminists, Fair Pl&eacute;, and representatives of the former Waking the Feminists movement. I understand that it is the Council&rsquo;s intention to continue to engage in discussion with these bodies and groups to ensure the effective implementation of its policy in this area.</p><p>Waking the Feminists has inspired a number of actions aimed at improving issues for female composers. Last March, I was delighted  to be in a position recently to announce funding under the Creative Ireland programme to co-fund the National Concert Hall and Sounding the Feminists&rsquo; five-year initiative to promote creative work by female musicians.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the Event Centre will be capable of accommodating a range of events including concerts, festivals, family entertainments, arts, cultural, sports, exhibitions, conferences and trade shows.  </p>  <p>  This is a project led by Cork City Council.  In December 2014, the development company BAM was selected by Cork City Council as the preferred tenderer.  BAM in turn has engaged international events company Live Nation as the preferred operator. The project is ultimately being developed and managed by Cork City Council.  This means that Cork City Council is responsible for its delivery.</p>  <p>  In the context of the application for additional funding of &euro;10 million for the project, my Department as sanctioning authority needs to ensure that the project is robust, complies with the Public Spending Code and will deliver value for money for the Exchequer. Due to its size and cost this project has significant procurement, state aid, legal and match funding complexities. </p>  <p>  Significant work is taking place by all parties involved in order to develop a sustainable project, culminating in a new cultural centre for Cork. High level meetings are continuing to take place regarding legal and funding requirements in light of the additional &euro;10 million funding request. Cork City Council is also reviewing a number of elements of the project; such as the revised application for planning permission which was submitted in August 2018 and funding of ancillary infrastructure near the event centre. All parties are eager for this project to progress and be delivered in accordance with the relevant Exchequer funding and legal requirements. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to engage with Cork City Council in relation to additional capital funding for the Event Centre.</p></reply>
