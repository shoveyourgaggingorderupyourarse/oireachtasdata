    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-26a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112600053#WRA00600"><p>The demolition by Israeli authorities of private property is of grave concern. Demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>  <p>  I was deeply dismayed to learn of the demolition by Israeli authorities on 3 November of more than 70 structures, in the community of Humsa Al Bqai&rsquo;a located in the northern Jordan Valley. I issued a statement on 6 November and Ireland&rsquo;s Representative Office in Ramallah has visited the site of the demolitions. Ireland, the EU, and the wider humanitarian community are ready to support those impacted and the West Bank Protection Consortium, of which Ireland is a member, is providing emergency shelter and support to affected families.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a very clear position on Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. They are illegal under international law and actively undermine the prospects for a Two-State solution.</p>  <p>  You raise the issue of a ban on import of settlement goods. Such a ban would not be compatible with EU law, and would not be implementable. This is the clear legal advice on this matter. The Government will therefore not be taking it forward.</p>  <p>  As it stands, however, EU law does already make a meaningful distinction between Israel, and settlements in occupied territory. This distinction has important practical effects. Since settlements are not part of Israel, the EU-Israel Association Agreement does not apply to them. This means that different tariffs apply to goods from settlements, and settlements are not eligible for participation in EU-Israel programmes.</p>  <p>  EU law and guidelines clearly differentiate between settlements on the one hand, and Israel, on the other. As such, they are an important part of the EU contribution to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemns the construction and expansion of settlements. </p>  <p>  Ireland will maintain its vigilance to ensure full implementation of these laws and guidelines.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-26a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1573" speakername="Colm Brophy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112600053#WRA01100"><p>Ireland has consistently called for a cessation of hostilities and we welcome the agreement reached by Armenia and Azerbaijan to end the military conflict in and around Nagorno Karabakh. We remain deeply concerned for the humanitarian situation in the region, where hostilities have had a devastating impact on local civilian populations. Ensuring access for humanitarian organisations must be a top priority to avoid further catastrophe as we head into the winter months. Ireland and the EU will fully support efforts to help bring about a sustainable and lasting peace and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance. In that regard, we note the key role that the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will continue to play.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the outbreak of armed conflict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, including the reported atrocities and ethnic profiling, and the humanitarian consequences. Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also a longstanding humanitarian supporter of the wider Horn of Africa region. In the context of the Tigray crisis my Department has reallocated &euro;416,000 for the humanitarian response within Ethiopia and &euro;500,000 to assist refugees in Eastern Sudan.</p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders. I have raised these issues in recent contacts with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney and with the US Ambassador, as well as with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress during my visit to Washington D.C. at the end of September.</p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide assistance and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. </p>  <p>  Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. In 2019, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 88 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, and in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable.</p>  <p>  We maintain close relations with members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum, and will continue to seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. The President-elect has always been a stalwart friend and supporter of Ireland, and we look forward to working closely with him and the incoming Administration, as reaffirmed by the Taoiseach during their recent telephone phone call. </p>  <p>  Post-pandemic, we want to see people-to-people links strengthened and we look forward to working with the new Administration, as well as with the United States Congress, across the aisle, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. Our Embassy and network of Consulates General will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 Visa Bill which is currently before the US Senate, having been passed in the House of Representatives. The bill was reintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Neal and Sensenbrenner in May 2019. If passed, this could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. While the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the congressional agenda, we hope that, when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate.  We will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p></reply>

These criteria include respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, internal situation in the destination country and risk of diversion. </p>  <p>  The EU is the only regional organisation to have established a legally binding arrangement on conventional arms exports.  Decisions on licensing of exports remain a Member State competence, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment responsible for this issue in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The EU Working Party on Conventional Arms Exports meets monthly to discuss export controls for conventional arms, and allows EU Member States to share information on their export policies to non-EU countries, and on national denials of applications for export licenses to non-EU countries.  </p>  <p>  In the EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings over the past year, EU Foreign Ministers have discussed the issue of arms exports in the context of existing EU and UN arms embargoes. On 14 October 2019 the Council discussed the commitment of Member States to strong national positions regarding arms export policies to Turkey, in response to unilateral Turkish military action in Syria.  In these discussions, Ireland supported strict application of the Common Position criteria in response to Turkey's actions.  </p>  <p>  In October 2020, the EU launched a searchable online database that allows all stakeholders consult and analyse data on Member States&rsquo; arms exports in a user-friendly manner. In December 2019, the EU renewed funding for its iTrace project with Conflict Armament Research.  The iTrace project aims to provide concrete information on the diversion and trafficking of conventional arms and their ammunition, including providing tailored support to Member States to assist in diversion risk assessment and mitigation, and to expose routes and entities involved in diversion to conflict zones.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-26a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112600053#WRA02500"><p>Post transition, operators will still be able to move goods across the UK Landbridge but the way they use the Landbridge will change.</p><p>The UK's accession to the Common Transit Convention (CTC) is welcome.  It allows EU goods to move under transit through Great Britain without undergoing full import and export formalities on entry and exit.  However, to avail of the benefits of the Convention, a number of new administrative steps must be completed in Ireland, Great Britain and at the port of re-entry. Details of all these new steps can be found at GOV.IE/Brexit. Furthermore, each consignment must also have a financial guarantee during the movement.  </p><p>Under Official Controls Regulation (EU) 2017/625, a range of goods, including animals and products of animal origin (POAO), are subject to controls on re-entering the Union and must be prior-notified to the Border Control Post (BCP) of re-entry to the EU ahead of arrival. </p><p>Ireland has undertaken substantial engagements at political and official level across the EU to ensure EU goods moving under transit are not subject to additional and unnecessary checks and controls.  In particular, we have worked with our French, Belgian and Dutch counterparts to understand each other&rsquo;s BCP operations.</p><p>For the vast majority of consignments transiting the Landbridge, documentary checks will be performed electronically in advance of the consignment re-entering the EU, and once the correct paperwork is in place transit goods should be &ldquo;green-routed&rdquo; to leave the Port. Identity and physical checks will only be necessary where the authorities suspect non-compliance. It is therefore vital that operators have the correct administration work in place.</p><p>We have regularly noted the likelihood of delays in UK ports for some time now and operators should plan accordingly. </p><p>Operators may wish to look at direct route options.  The process for moving goods directly between Ireland and other EU Member States will not change nor be subject to the new procedures set out on our website.</p></reply>

Strengthening bilateral relations with the US is a priority for Ireland as set out in our Programme for Government,<b></b>as well<b></b>in our Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025. </p><p>With each successive administration in the White House and each successive US Congress, our relationship has been valued and strengthened, to the benefit of our people on both sides of the Atlantic. The Government engages regularly with the US Administration and with US elected representatives from across the political spectrum. </p><p>At the end of September, I travelled to the US for a series of engagements in Washington D.C., which included meetings with representatives from the Administration, as well as with Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans. We will continue to maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum, and will continue to seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with the new administration of President-elect Joe Biden. </p><p>The Taoiseach and President-elect Biden spoke by telephone two weeks ago, during which the President-elect reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement. In addition, they looked forward to working together bilaterally and across a range of international areas including EU-US relations, the UN including the Security Council, and on the important global challenges of COVID19, economic recovery and climate change.</p><p>We look forward to working with the new Administration, once it is in place, to progress international peace and security.

We will engage constructively across the Council agenda, on the basis of three core principles: Building Peace, Strengthening Prevention, and Ensuring Accountability. </p>  <p>  A key aspect of Building Peace is peacekeeping. We will look to improve peacekeeping mandates, and strengthen the link with peacebuilding. We want to emphasise an inclusive approach, ensuring the involvement of women, youth and civil society. </p>  <p>  On Strengthening Prevention, we will address drivers of conflict, notably human rights violations and climate change, and strengthen the protection of civilians, including from conflict-related hunger. </p>  <p>  To Ensure Accountability, we will uphold international humanitarian and human rights law, and stand firmly in support of the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  We will also engage actively on country-specific issues. We are identifying where we can have most impact, for example on Women Peace and Security, on climate and security, in relation to Iran and the JCPOA, on sanctions policy and practice, and on humanitarian access in Syria. </p>  <p>  We have good relationships with the Council&rsquo;s Permanent and elected members. We do not agree on everything, and we have no illusions on the challenges ahead.  I am undertaking a series of consultations with a wide range of counterparts and my officials are doing the same.</p>  <p>  We will draw from the extensive expertise available within Irish civil society and academia. We have established a stakeholder forum, in partnership with the IIEA, to support us in planning for our Council term. </p>  <p>  This is a Government-wide effort, and we will work closely with other Departments. An inter-departmental coordination group has been established to facilitate information sharing and ensure coherence on cross-cutting issues. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to discuss our preparations with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on 12 November, and I look forward to keeping the Oireachtas informed of our work on the Council throughout Ireland&rsquo;s term.</p></reply>

There are credible allegations of mass casualties, including civilian casualties, and of human rights abuses. There is a grave risk of a humanitarian crisis. Tigray is home to many refugees, displaced persons and local communities already coping with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. If not contained, this conflict could threaten the stability of Ethiopia, Africa&rsquo;s second most populous country, and have serious regional implications for the wider Horn of Africa, one of the continent&rsquo;s most fragile regions. </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  The situation in Ethiopia was raised by HRVP Borrell at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 19 November. Minister Coveney intervened calling for continued EU efforts to push for a resolution of the crisis, and stressed the need to act fast and collectively to call for unconditional, unrestricted access for humanitarian actors to affected areas.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa is engaging closely with other EU Heads of Mission, the UN and other members of the international community in monitoring, reporting and advocating on the situation and in preparing for an emergency humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral development cooperation programme is in Ethiopia.  The Embassy of Ireland is in the process of providing &euro;416,000 to the humanitarian response in Tigray, along with a projected &euro;500,000 to support refugees in Eastern Sudan. My Department is actively looking at ways to address other critical funding needs in light of the escalating humanitarian situation.</p></reply>

Settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory is clearly illegal under international law. </p>  <p>  On 16 October, I made a statement condemning a significant further settlement expansion of close to 5000 new housing units in the West Bank and in and around Jerusalem, including Givat Hamatos. </p>  <p>  On 15 November, the Israeli authorities announced a decision to open a tender for construction of a new settlement of over 1,200 housing units in Givat Hamatos in occupied East Jerusalem. I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position on this in a statement on 17 November. I condemned the decision by Israeli authorities to open this tender which undermines the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State and the possibility of a negotiated Two-State solution in line with the internationally agreed parameters with Jerusalem as the future capital of two states. It also erodes trust and confidence between the parties, which is critical for the resumption of meaningful negotiations.   </p>  <p>  Senior officials in my Department met the Israeli Ambassador on 17 November to underline Ireland&rsquo;s serious concerns at the expansion of settlements in this strategically sensitive area between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Representative in Ramallah visited the Givat Hamatos site on 16 November, along with a number of other EU and non-EU colleagues, including the EU Representative. I am aware that there were vocal but peaceful pro-settlement protests during their visit. The press conference after the visit was held at another location so that the press interviews could be fully audible. </p>  <p>  The EU HRVP Mr. Borrell made a statements on this issue on 15 October and 15 November. On 18 November, following the UN Security Council briefing on the situation in the Middle East, the current and incoming EU members of the Council (Ireland, Belgium, Estonia, France and Germany), along with Norway as a fellow incoming member, delivered a joint media statement on the Middle East Peace Process in which we called on Israel to halt all settlement expansion and demolitions. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call on the Israeli Government to reverse this decision and to halt all settlement construction. Our longstanding support for a Two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy, which I will continue to prioritise.</p></reply>

Securing an overall future relationship agreement, including the best possible outcome on fisheries is a priority for Ireland. I have repeatedly raised fisheries as a priority for Ireland in my bilateral political contacts, as indeed has the Taoiseach, Minister McConalogue and other members of the Government.  In particular we, and our EU partners, are very clear that the issue of fisheries cannot be separated from the wider trade negotiations. </p>  <p>  Ireland is seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in relation to access conditions, quota shares and the traditional activity of the EU fleet, while insisting that fisheries issues are dealt with as part of an overall trade deal. It is vital that we do everything possible to protect our vulnerable coastal communities and fishers. In particular, it will be important to ensure no EU Member States are disproportionately affected by any new arrangements. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall economic partnership agreement on trade is linked to progress on fisheries. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which I chair, meets regularly to discuss progress in the EU-UK Future Relationship negotiations, and is attended by representatives of the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  Clearly, the two sides are still very far apart even as we approach the final stages of the negotiations. The European Commission Task Force, led by Michel Barnier, is continuing to work towards achieving an overall agreement, and for a satisfactory outcome on this area.  Affected Member States, including Ireland, are continuing our very close engagement with the Taskforce on the EU approach.</p></reply>

During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The UK claimed sovereignty over Rockall in 1955 and purported to annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.</p>  <p>  While Ireland has never recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, neither have we ever sought to claim sovereignty ourselves.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries should have no significance for establishing legal claims to continental shelf or an exclusive economic zone. Ireland, together with a number of like-minded countries, worked hard to advance this position at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which took place from 1972 to 1982 and I'm glad to say that it is fully reflected in the Convention adopted at the end of that Conference.  Article 121, paragraph 3 of the UN Law of the Sea Convention provides that: &lsquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rsquo;</p></reply>

Such suspensions would not serve the interests of any of the parties and, in any case, would require consensus within the European Union. </p>  <p>  A proposal to suspend or review the terms of the agreement would result in a divisive debate which would divert attention from the need to restore momentum to the peace process. It could also result in further difficulties in ensuring the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian people. </p>  <p>  Ireland's position on settlement expansion, related infrastructure development, the demolition of Palestinian homes and other buildings, and the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes, is extremely clear. Settlements are illegal under international law, and all actions which compromise the viability of a future Palestinian state are very damaging. </p>  <p>  The announcement on 15 November of the opening of tenders for settlement construction in the strategic area of Givat Hamatos in East Jerusalem is of grave concern. As I underlined in my statement on 16 November, this action by the Israeli authorities actively undermines the prospects for a two-state solution. Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements, and Ireland&rsquo;s Representative in Ramallah visited the site on 16 November along with other European diplomats. Senior officials in my Department met with the Ambassador of Israel to Ireland on 17 November to underline Ireland&rsquo;s serious concerns at this decision.</p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. Ireland and the EU stand by the internationally agreed parameters for a negotiated peace agreement and continue to urge the Israeli Government to uphold its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment of a civilian population, and under international human rights law. </p></reply>

I intend that Ireland would keep open lines of communication with both Israel and the Palestinians while we are on the Council, and to hear their views, as well as acting on our long-standing principles.</p>  <p>  The demolition of Palestinian homes, and demolition or seizure of related structures are cruel and unjust actions. These practices also cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians, and impinge on the right of children to an education.</p>  <p>  On 26 October, Ireland made a national statement in the Security Council open debate on the situation in the Middle East, and called on Israel to halt demolitions. </p>  <p>  Following the Security Council briefing on the situation in the Middle East on 18 November, the current and incoming EU members of the Council (Ireland, Belgium, Estonia, France and Germany), along with Norway as a fellow incoming member, delivered a joint media statement on the Middle East Peace Process in which we called on Israel to halt all settlement expansion and demolitions.</p>  <p>  Beyond the UN Security Council, Ireland conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.  In my statement of 16 October I called on Israel to halt demolitions and allow for legal construction for Palestinian residents. I have also raised the issue on my visits to the region. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv has raised the issue of demolitions with the Israeli authorities, along with a group of EU and non-EU colleagues.

Since the outbreak of conflict in 2013, almost 400,000 people have died and more than 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance out of an estimated population of 12 million. This has been compounded by the impact of flooding and COVID-19.</p>  <p>  In 2018, President Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with the opposition and a unity Government was formed in February of this year. A transitional three-year period is now under way. However, the situation is very fragile with key aspects of the peace deal still to be implemented, including the creation of a unified army, local governance and transitional justice measures.</p>  <p>  It is critical that all the parties to the conflict maintain their commitment to implementing the peace agreement. While the ceasefire is largely holding between the main opposition parties, I am concerned that sub-national violence and human rights abuses continue to cause immense harm to civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. Since 2018, funding of &euro;800,000 has been provided  to the regional bloc IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority for Development).  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, addressing humanitarian need remains a priority for Ireland. Almost &euro;80 million in humanitarian funding has been provided since 2012 to our UN and NGO partners, for lifesaving support to those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to monitor the situation closely, including via our Embassy in Addis Ababa which is accredited to South Sudan, and via the EU Delegation in Juba. In the context of our upcoming tenure on the UN Security Council, on which South Sudan will feature as a regular agenda item, Ireland will continue to engage closely on these issues including on the role of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), and protection of civilians.  </p></reply>

The opening of this diplomatic Mission will advance Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the region and illustrates our commitment to the British-Irish relationship &ndash; and to the Irish community in Britain and Irish business &ndash; following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. It is also a key component of the Government's Global Ireland 2025 agenda - to double Ireland's global influence and impact by 2025. It is expected that the first Consul General will be in place in the first half of 2021.</p>  <p>  The new Consulate will focus on political engagement, diaspora engagement, and economic and trade promotion. It will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s collaboration with local and regional authorities in a consular area of 15 million people, including Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle. It will facilitate Team Ireland&rsquo;s collective work to advance Ireland&rsquo;s commercial interests, following the establishment of the Enterprise Ireland office in Manchester in 2019. The region has of course deep ties with Ireland based on history and our diaspora. Together with the T&aacute;naiste, I discussed the role of the new Mission, and our ambitions for the relationship between Ireland and the North of England, with the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region on 16 November.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s vital relationship with the UK.  Investing in our physical presence and engaging in every region is central to this. The reopening of Ireland's Consulate General in Cardiff last year, and the announcement in respect of the new Consulate for the North of England reflect this, as does our ongoing investment in the Embassy in London.</p>  <p>  These diplomatic Missions, and the Consulate General in Edinburgh, will support the development of the British-Irish relationship in what will be a new phase post-Brexit. The resourcing of our diplomatic network will be kept under ongoing review, to ensure it is sufficient to protect and advance our interests.  </p></reply>

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has committed to take a decision on whether to order a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane by the end of November. </p>  <p>  I met with the Finucane family earlier this month to reiterate our support. Following this meeting, I wrote to the Secretary of State ahead of his decision, to underline the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong position that a public inquiry is the correct and only satisfactory way forward.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also met with the Finucane family earlier this week and the Government will continue to engage with the UK Government on this issue at this critical juncture.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers in September expressed their deep concern that a decision has still not been made by the UK authorities on how to respond to the 2019 UK Supreme Court judgment with respect to the case of Pat Finucane. The next meeting of the Committee is to take place in December, and the UK Government&rsquo;s decision is awaited.</p>  <p>  The Finucane family, like so many other families, have waited for far too long, and have had to campaign determinedly for decades in their pursuit of truth and justice. This underlines the clear need for the implementation of the framework agreed in Stormont House in 2014 to address the legacy of the past comprehensively and fairly, and in a way that responds to the needs of all victims and survivors, and indeed society as a whole.</p></reply>

Demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. </p>  <p>  I was deeply dismayed to learn of the demolition by Israeli authorities on 3 November of more than 70 structures, belonging to 11 Palestinian families in the community of Humsa Al Bqai&rsquo;a located in the northern Jordan Valley. These demolitions include residential, livelihood and sanitation facilities.</p>  <p>  I issued a statement on these demolitions on 6 November in which I underlined that destruction of private property such as this is clearly prohibited under international humanitarian law. Israel, as the occupying power, has clear obligations towards members of this community, including the 41 children impacted by the demolitions.</p>  <p>  On 6 November, Ireland&rsquo;s Representative Office in Ramallah visited the site of the demolitions, along with other diplomatic representatives. Ireland, the EU, and the wider humanitarian community are ready to support those impacted and the West Bank Protection Consortium, of which Ireland is a member, is providing emergency shelter and support to affected families.</p>  <p>  While my primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families, it is important that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should be pursued. Ireland pursues this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium. It is the practice of the Consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, the Consortium has sought compensation of over &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.</p></reply>

We have successfully protected CAP funding for Ireland and secured a special allocation of &euro;300 million in recognition of the challenges facing our agricultural sector. We have secured a special allocation of &euro;120 million for a new PEACE PLUS programme to build a significant fund to further reconciliation and North-South cooperation. We have also secured an increase in the share of customs collection costs we can retain and the inclusion of the special Brexit Adjustment Reserve in the MFF. </p>  <p>  A proposed compromise agreement on the MFF was reached with the European Parliament on 10 November.

This is the clear legal advice on this matter. The Government will therefore not be taking it forward. </p>  <p>  As it stands, however, EU law does already make a meaningful distinction between Israel, and settlements in occupied territory. This distinction has important practical effects. Since settlements are not part of Israel, the EU-Israel Association Agreement does not apply to them. This means that different tariffs apply to goods from settlements, and settlements are not eligible for participation in EU-Israel programmes.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been vigilant to ensure that EU law in this regard is upheld. For example, in 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations in a case which was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, challenging the implementation of EU rules on the labelling of foodstuffs originating from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. </p>  <p>  The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, confirmed that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy.</p>  <p>  EU law and guidelines on goods from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory therefore, clearly differentiate between settlements on the one hand, and Israel, on the other. As such, they are an important part of the EU contribution to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334. Ireland will maintain its vigilance to ensure full implementation of these laws and guidelines.</p></reply>

Along with the UN and the EU, Ireland believes that the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in Yemen is through a negotiated end to the conflict. The UN&rsquo;s repeated recent warnings of the risk of famine in Yemen underlines the seriousness of the situation there and the urgency that is needed to address it.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. We urge all parties to the conflict to engage with him without pre-conditions, to enact confidence-building measures to secure a sustainable peace, and to allow the people of Yemen to begin to rebuild their lives. Ireland also continues to call for full, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian and health workers and supplies to all parts of Yemen, in line with Security Council Resolution 2532.</p>  <p>  This year Ireland has provided &euro;5 million in funding to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund, which mobilises and channels funding to NGOs and UN agencies that are best placed to deliver lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable. In total, Ireland has contributed over &euro;27 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding at the global level, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). In 2020, the CERF has provided $35 million in funding to Yemen. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since 2015, the EU has allocated &euro;554 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen.</p>  <p>  Yemen faces alarming levels of food insecurity and has received less than half of the humanitarian funds requested at the start of this year.

Promoting national ownership is one of the key principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Ownership is the best strategy to guarantee that development investments succeed, and has the best opportunity of reaching the furthest behind first. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s eleven Embassies in Sub Saharan Africa and our Embassy in Vietnam have responsibility for managing aid programmes. Each has a strong focus on ensuring that essential services including health, education, and social protection are targeted at those who are furthest behind in the poorest communities.  Whilst not working directly at community level, the Missions allocate considerable resources to civil society organisations and associations. These organisations work closely with communities in service delivery as well as championing the rights of citizens. </p>  <p>  A hallmark of many of Ireland&rsquo;s partner organisations is the adoption of participatory approaches to working with communities.  The Embassies consult and engage with partners regularly at the planning and implementation phases of their country strategy processes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to promote the vital role of civil society organisations in developing countries on the international stage- in the EU, the UN and OECD. </p>  <p>  The 2020 Peer Review of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation by the OECD Development Assistance Committee found that &lsquo;a long-lasting commitment to engaging in partnerships is the trademark of Ireland's development co-operation', and that &lsquo;partnerships with Irish and local civil society organisations (CSOs) are characterised by mutual trust and an open culture of substantive and regular dialogue.&rsquo; </p>  <p>  We expect our programme partners to continue to develop a dynamic relationship with local counterpart organisations and focus on building the local institutional capacity to work effectively with communities. </p></reply>

The different elements of this crisis are inextricably linked and continue to have a grave impact on the people of Venezuela. I am very concerned at recent reports to the UN Human Rights Council on the human rights situation there. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation in the country. The mass migration that has occurred as a result of the crisis is also impacting on neighbouring countries. By the end of 2020, it is estimated that 6.5 million people in total will have left Venezuela arising from the current crisis.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.  Since 2019, we have provided almost &euro;2.5m in funding to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), as well as NGOs responding to the needs of migrants and refugees. My Department will be providing additional financial support in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  We work closely with our EU and international partners to seek to ensure a coordinated approach to the political crisis in Venezuela, based on our shared democratic, rule of law and human rights norms. EU efforts in recent months, which I fully support, have been focused on the upcoming Venezuelan legislative elections, scheduled for 6 December, and have sought to ensure that the minimum conditions for free, fair and democratic elections could be put in place. I am concerned that these conditions have not been met. My Department will be monitoring the situation closely in the election and post-election period.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to support international efforts to achieve a democratic solution to the Venezuelan crisis.  I will continue to support efforts to overcome the crisis through a negotiated and peaceful process that fully involves and is owned by the people of Venezuela.</p></reply>

It is designed to provide the EU with a financing mechanism for a range of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) actions. </p>  <p>  The European Council agreed the EPF&rsquo;s broad parameters in June 2020, including an overall financial ceiling of &euro;5 billion over the seven years of the next MFF.  As the EU budget cannot finance operations with military or defence implications, the EPF will be off-budget, incorporating two existing off-budget mechanisms; the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. </p>  <p>  The first of these, the Athena mechanism, funds common costs for EU-led military crisis management missions.  Ireland contributes personnel to three of these missions, all of which are authorised by the UN. The UN increasingly relies on regional organisations, including the EU and the African Union (AU), to carry out peacekeeping operations and crisis management missions mandated by the UN Security Council. For example, the AU leads the UN-mandated mission in Somalia, Amisom, which itself is largely funded by the EU through the African Peace Facility, which will also be incorporated into the EPF. </p>  <p>  The EPF will provide continuity while also supporting new initiatives, including allowing EU financing of peace support operations outside Africa. In certain circumstances - and with strong safeguards - funding from the EPF may be utilised for military equipment, including equipment designed to deliver lethal force. Ireland has made clear from the start of the negotiations that we will not fund assistance measures which include lethal weapons. This reflects our Programme for Government commitment that &lsquo;Ireland will not be part of decision making or funding for lethal force weapons for non-peacekeeping purposes.&rsquo; </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage actively in negotiations on the design of the EPF to ensure both the inclusion of strong safeguards for any provision of military equipment and that Member States can abstain from funding the provision of lethal weapons. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic position was recognised in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate and it is our view that it should be taken into account in any arrangements agreed in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  Workable road transport arrangements are important not only because of our unique geographic situation but also because of the importance of such arrangements to the all-island economy.  </p>  <p>  We must however also be clear that what is possible to achieve in this area will also be determined by the UK&rsquo;s level of ambition and respect for the EU&rsquo;s red lines. </p>  <p>  Post transition, operators will still be able to move goods via the Landbridge but the way they use the Landbridge will change.  This includes undertaking a number of new administrative steps in Ireland, Great Britain and at the port of re-entry. Details of these new steps can be found on our website - GOV.IE/Brexit.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has undertaken substantial engagements at political and official level across the EU to ensure EU goods moving under transit are not subject to additional and unnecessary checks and controls.  In particular, we have worked with our French, Belgian and Dutch counterparts.  The overarching aim has been to ensure that, once the correct paperwork is in place, the necessary controls are completed and transit goods should be &ldquo;green-lighted&rdquo; to leave the Port. Physical checks will only be necessary where the authorities suspect non-compliance. It is therefore vital that operators undertake all the necessary steps.</p>  <p>  The process for moving goods on direct routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to any new procedures.  Additional capacity on direct routes between Ireland and the EU has been added throughout 2020, including Cork &ndash; Zeebrugge, Dublin &ndash; Santander, Waterford &ndash; Rotterdam, Rosslare &ndash; Bilbao and Rosslare &ndash; Roscoff, and there will be further increases in capacity in 2021.  The assessment of the Department of Transport and the Irish Maritime Development Office, which issued an updated analysis on capacity on direct maritime routes to Continental Europe in October, is that there is sufficient capacity available on direct routes to accommodate displaced Landbridge traffic.  Traders should consider switching to these routes ahead of the end of the transition period to avoid the need to implement new procedures, as well as to avoid the likely delays and blockages at UK ports. </p></reply>

Such actions and statements are particularly regrettable given the ongoing attempts to create the space for dialogue and to resume negotiations for a comprehensive settlement.  Ireland and the EU are clear that the only viable solution remains reunification of the island, based on a bi-zonal and bi-communal federation, with political equality, as set out in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. </p>  <p>  The recent actions and remarks of Turkey on Cyprus also come at a time when Turkey is continuing its activities in the Cypriot Exclusive Economic Zone and the wider Eastern Mediterranean. Ireland has consistently called on Turkey to show restraint, respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus and Greece and refrain from actions that infringe on international law and risk the stability and security of the region. Ireland continues to stand in full solidarity with Cyprus and Greece on this issue. </p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply disappointed that Turkey has not taken advantage of the European Council&rsquo;s recent offer of a positive EU-Turkey political agenda, if it were to cease its illegal activities with regard to Cyprus and Greece, and has instead continued to indulge in provocative actions. While our hope remains that these issues can be resolved through dialogue, if Turkish behaviour does not change, it is clear that further restrictive measures must be on the table at the December European Council. </p>  <p>  In terms of the wider EU-Turkey relationship, I would like to see a more stable and constructive relationship develop in the future, particularly given the importance of the relationship to issues such as migration, security and the economy. This would benefit both the EU and Turkey. However, this very much depends on Turkish behaviour, both in terms of its domestic situation and its attitude towards its neighbours.</p></reply>

We have seen mass and indiscriminate detentions, including of children, violence against peaceful protesters, evidence of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including reports of sexual abuse, internet shutdowns and curbs on media freedoms. </p>  <p>  UN Special Rapporteurs have highlighted continued violations of children's rights and the persecution of women human rights defenders in the country. Ireland shares their concerns and we will continue to raise our voice on the appalling human rights situation in international settings.</p>  <p>  Despite large-scale peaceful protests, members of the political opposition have been threatened, harassed, detained and forced into exile. We have also seen loss of life, including the recent death of a peaceful protester in police custody which was needless and shameful.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have repeatedly condemned the use of violence by the Belarusian authorities against their own people. We sent a firm message through the imposition of targeted sanctions against key figures in Belarus. So far 55 individuals have been sanctioned, including Lukashenko himself, and we stand ready to go further.</p>  <p>  However, sanctions are just one element of a broader response. A review of EU-Belarus relations is underway and we will continue to work with our EU partners on redirecting EU funds towards Belarusian civil society and away from the authorities. Ireland has also committed &euro;50,000 for two projects in Belarus through the European Endowment for Democracy that aim to protect human rights and media freedoms. </p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers remain firmly engaged in trying to bring about a peaceful and democratic resolution to the crisis. We will continue to press the Belarusian authorities to end their campaign of violence against the Belarusian people, to unconditionally release those unjustly detained and to respect their international commitments.    </p>  <p>  We are unwavering in our support for the Belarusian people in their clear and simple demands that their elections to be free and fair and that their basic human rights be respected.</p></reply>

He was active in discussions on the EU-Africa partnership at Foreign Affairs Councils in February and September this year.</p>  <p>  At a discussion of EU Development Ministers in September, I addressed the Team Europe response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the EU&rsquo;s support for the furthest behind in Africa. Building on this work, the European Council identified priority areas for cooperation with Africa in October.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes engagement of the Oireachtas on this critical EU partnership. Minister Coveney met with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on 12 November to discuss issues on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council, including Africa. On 20 October, the D&aacute;il had an opportunity to debate the European Council discussion of EU-Africa relations.</p>  <p>  The perspectives of civil society partners is very important. The European Commission engaged with civil society, including CONCORD Europe, representing 2,600 NGOs, including D&oacute;chas -the  Irish association of development NGOs - when setting out a new partnership with Africa earlier this year.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains ongoing engagement with civil society partners. Recent instances include civil society partners' participation in the Government&rsquo;s National Task Team on Rural Africa, which advanced Ireland&rsquo;s potential contribution to a significant strand of the EU-Africa partnership. Minister Coveney discussed the EU-Africa partnership with civil society last month at a conference of the Irish Forum for International Agricultural Development. These are in addition to regular policy discussions at official level through D&oacute;chas.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.</p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I brought forward a committee stage amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  </p>  <p>  I consider this to be an interim solution only. While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

Lockdown restrictions saw the Irish economy contract by 6 per cent in the second quarter - the largest quarterly decline on record.</p>  <p>  This figure was at the lower-end in a European context, with GDP declining by -20 per cent in the UK and -12 per cent in the euro area respectively. However, Ireland&rsquo;s GDP was boosted by a surge in exports of pharmaceuticals, and masks a very sharp hit to the domestic economy. By contrast, domestic demand declined by -16 per cent in the second quarter, a figure that is more in line with the contractions seen in other countries. </p>  <p>  As restrictions were lifted over the summer, however, the economy showed signs of recovery. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 30 per cent in April, declined to 16 per cent in September. Similarly, retail sales, which collapsed in April, surged in May and June, with activity remaining above the pre-pandemic level since then. The lifting of restrictions in other European countries also resulted in rebounds in economic activity, with GDP growth of around 16 and 13 per cent recorded in the UK and euro area in the third quarter. </p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2021, my Department forecast a decline in GDP of -2&frac12; per cent this year, with domestic demand projected to fall by 6 per cent. These projections assumed that targeted measures would be introduced in response to any increase in the Covid-19 infection rate; crucially, that there would not be a second national lockdown. However, the recent move to level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 means that the contraction of the economy this year is likely to be more severe than anticipated. This is by no means out of line with the experience of other European countries. Recent increases in Covid-19 cases have seen the introduction of additional restrictions in the UK and euro area, with GDP declines of -10 and -8 per cent respectively forecast by the European Commission for this year. </p></reply>

One payment will be made to eligible businesses covering this restrictions period, with payments made by Revenue within 3 days of the submission of a qualifying claim.

The development of the new Statement of Strategy will reflect the objectives as set out in the Programme for Government. When finalised, it will serve as a framework for, and guide to, the business planning, resource allocation and risk management processes in the Department over the next three years.</p>  <p>  In recent years, there has been significant reform and innovation in the Public Service. These changes continue to deliver improved services and cost effectiveness across a range of themes such as digital government, public procurement and shared services. Considerable reforms have been implemented to Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework. The new approach is intended to permit a more open budgetary process, allow stronger dialogue with the D&aacute;il on key elements and facilitate the continued central role of Government in the development of budgetary proposals, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.</p>  <p>  My Department plays a central role in the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s economic, fiscal and financial goals. The macroeconomic, fiscal and financial implications of having to live with the implications of Covid-19 will frame all aspects of the Statement of Strategy and will inform all of the key challenges and opportunities within our operating environment.   </p>  <p>  Through this Strategy, my Department will implement policies to support economic stabilisation and fiscal sustainability and will shape banking and financial services policy for a modern vibrant economy that supports innovation and sustainability. </p>  <p>  My Department also has a significant role in EU and international matters, carrying out a broad range of activities as well as international outreach. Development and implementation of strategies at EU/Euro area level and internationally in relation to economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation will feature in the new Statement of Strategy objectives. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the management of this aspect of my Department&rsquo;s remit has allowed my Department to pursue innovative initiatives which we will continue to enhance under the new Statement of Strategy.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently published an innovation strategy for the Public Service and hosted an innovation strategy workshop to provide guidance on incorporating innovation into the Statements of Strategy of Government Departments. The guidance provided in this new innovation strategy will help us in continuing to grow innovation across Government Departments.  </p></reply>

The Death Benefit Insurance is provided by insurance undertakings. Some credit unions discharge some or all of the cost of the insurance on behalf of their members, while other credit unions have adopted a member pay approach. Central Bank credit union regulations do not place any specific requirements on credit unions that participate in Death Benefit Insurance schemes.</p>  <p>  It is a commercial decision for individual credit unions to determine whether they decide to offer Death Benefit Insurance or indeed whether they decide to discontinue providing the service.  </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 is silent on withdrawal of services or the notice to be provided to members by credit unions before the withdrawal of services. The Registry of Credit Unions expects credit unions to communicate with their members in a clear and transparent manner, including in circumstances where they intend to amend or discontinue an existing service. The Registry of Credit Unions also expects credit unions to give reasonable notice to affected members in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  On motions made at general meetings, while Part V of the 1997 Act sets out provisions relating to meetings and resolutions, it is silent on motions moved at general meetings. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I recognise the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.

This provides that the supply of goods or services to another Member State shall be zero-rated for VAT purposes where that supply is intended for the use of armed forces of any state party to NATO other than the Member State of destination itself.  Such supplies include supplies to messes and canteens.  VAT is a self-assessed tax and it is not known if any supplies have been zero rated on the basis of this provision. Supplies to other Member States and exports to third countries are generally zero rated in any case. </p>  <p>  In respect of Excise, the provision in question is Article 12 (1)(c) of the General Excise Directive. This provides that excise goods, which relates to alcohol, tobacco and mineral oil products, shall be exempted from payment of excise when they are intended to be used by the armed forces of any state party to NATO when based in an EU Member State, other than the armed forces of the EU Member State itself.  As liability to excise duty arises when excise goods are released for consumption in the State and as no armed forces of another State have been based here at any time, the question of the use of this provision has not arisen. </p>  <p>  Both the VAT and the Excise provisions mentioned have been in place since 1993 and are already applicable to Ireland.  Measures to transpose these provisions have been included in Finance Bill 2020 as Ireland has a legal requirement to ensure that our national legislation on VAT and Excise is correctly aligned with the EU Directives.  This is notwithstanding the fact that there is no change to the constitutional provisions relating to armed forces which effectively prohibit foreign forces being based or maintained within the State.  These measures relate to the VAT and Excise treatment of supplies only and do not impact on Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality or any other policy in relation to defence.</p>  <p>  A further Council Directive which was enacted in 2019, Council Directive 2019 / 2235, contains a number of measures in respect of EU defence efforts which will take effect from 1 July 2022 and will be binding on all EU Member States, including Ireland.   The purpose of these measures is to align the VAT and Excise treatment for EU forces, undertaking a common defence effort under the common security and defence policy of the EU, to the current VAT and Excise treatment in place for NATO forces. The transposition of these measures into Irish legislation is also included in Finance Bill 2020.  These provisions will have an extremely limited application, if any, and will not give rise to any cost to the exchequer.  </p>  <p>  As these articles do not impact on Ireland's neutrality I did not seek a derogation for Ireland.</p></reply>

Following the launch of the European Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth in March 2018, we have witnessed significant progress at EU level in the area of sustainable finance, with Ireland engaging constructively on the related legislative proposals.  For example, I was delighted that Ireland was amongst a handful of locations to host a virtual workshop during the summer on the EU Renewed Strategy for Sustainable Financial Services with leading Irish companies, academics and EU Commission officials.</p><p>Progress on the Taxonomy Regulation and the Disclosures Regulation, which aims to remove barriers to advancing sustainable goals, will be the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s sustainable finance regulatory architecture and this represents a significant step in ensuring that the EU and Ireland will be key players in sustainable finance in the years ahead. For example, the new Disclosure Framework, which is to apply from March of 2021, will provide greater transparency and enable end-investors to compare different financial products in terms of their environmental impact. The application of the Taxonomy Regulation in particular, which will establish a harmonised classification system for environmentally sustainable activities, is essential in this regard. </p><p>However, there are also important pieces of the jigsaw yet to be completed and these will be essential to achieve maximum value from the new sustainable finance regime. In particular, the lack of reliable and agreed climate-related and environmental data is currently a key challenge for financial market participants, as the availability of, and accessibility to, high quality and reliable ESG (Environmental and Social Governance) data remains a prerequisite for enabling investors to make well informed and sustainability informed decisions.  </p><p>The recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which seeks to develop consistent climate-related risk disclosures for use by companies, are very important in this regard, representing best practice for companies, opening up access to more sustainable pools of growth capital, meanwhile addressing the needs of investors for greater transparency. The Government welcomes the adoption of the TCFD by those corporates who are already engaged with the taskforce and it is actively encouraging greater take up as more Irish firms look to accelerate and scale their own climate transition plans. For example, Action 29 of the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Action Plan 2020, Sustainable Finance Skillnet supports the development of several sub-sector focused sustainable finance skills development programmes across banking, insurance and asset management by building a suite of programmes focused on a number of aspects including TCFD disclosure. It is expected that the upcoming <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Action Plan 2021 will build upon this further.</p><p>Similarly, we are very supportive of the work of the European Commission through the ongoing revision of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, which also seeks to address issues in relation to ESG data reporting.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive), which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key policy priority for this Government. In terms of motor insurance specifically, I would note that figures from both the Central Statistics Office and National Claims Information Database have shown that average premium prices have declined in recent years. Nonetheless, there is still a need for reforms to ensure that premiums also reduce and stabilise for other insurance products, in particular those of interest to businesses, including SMEs, such as employer and public liability insurance.</p>  <p>  There are a number of areas that require reform and this is why making progress on these will require a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach. This is recognised in the Programme for Government, which lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  These include increasing transparency; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; minimising the scope for questionable claims; and increasing market competition. Implementation of this ambitious agenda has commenced and will be a key issue for myself and Minister of State Fleming, as well other members of Cabinet, especially those that will be working on this issue through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s Sub-Group on Insurance Reform. This Sub-Group is currently working on an Action Plan for Insurance Reform and it is our intention to have it published before the end of the year. This will lay out the specific actions and timelines for implementation, and who is responsible for doing so.</p>  <p>  In terms of the discussions my Department has had on this issue, Minister of State Fleming and I have held a number of meetings with key stakeholders in recent months. These include bilateral meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform and Insurance Ireland.  Most recently as part of a comprehensive engagement on the Government&rsquo;s new insurance reform agenda, Minister of State Fleming concluded meetings with the eight largest non-life insurers in the Irish market, the Law Society, the Bar Council, Brokers Ireland, and the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland. These meetings are in addition to those with other Government entities, as well as numerous inter-Departmental working group meetings on the issue of insurance reform in advance of the publication of the aforementioned Action Plan for Insurance Reform. </p></reply>

At the same time, the employment may also be subject to tax in the country in which the work is carried out.  In accordance with general principles of international tax, where instances of double taxation arise on the same income, relief against Irish tax may be claimed by way of a credit for any foreign tax already paid, subject to the terms of any applicable Double Taxation Agreement (DTA).  Unilateral relief may also be available in certain circumstances under domestic Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  In the case of a person who lives in the State but who works in Northern Ireland, the terms of the Ireland/UK DTA provide for relief by allowing the Irish resident to claim a credit for the UK tax paid against any Irish tax that may be due on the same income.</p>  <p>  The relief referred to by the Deputies is in addition to the above, and may apply, subject to certain conditions, where a person lives in Ireland but works wholly outside of the State.  </p>  <p>  I would advise the Deputies that this relief applies not only to persons with a UK based employment, but also for employments in the EU and DTA-network regions in compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s treaty obligations.  It therefore has broader application beyond the Northern Ireland issues raised.</p>  <p>  The conditions for this Trans-Border relief are set out in section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  In general, in order to qualify for this relief the individual must:</p>  <p>  - Be tax resident in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - work in a country that Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement with in an employment held for a continuous period of 13 weeks in the year;</p>  <p>  - the employment duties must be wholly exercised outside of the State with none performed in the State, save for duties considered incidental to the foreign employment;</p>  <p>  - have paid tax in the other country and are not due a refund of the tax; and</p>  <p>  - be present in Ireland for at least one day for every week they work abroad.</p>  <p>  Where the Trans-Border relief applies in the case of an Irish resident who works in the UK, it operates in such a way that only UK tax is charged on the employment income and there is no charge to Irish tax on the same income.  Any additional Irish tax that may be due is foregone under the domestic Irish legislation.  </p>  <p>  This tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in Ireland.  However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Revenue have confirmed that if employees are required to work from home in the State due to COVID-19, such days spent working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.</p>  <p>  The flexibility being shown in the context of the pandemic should not be confused with the overall operation of the measure which requires that a person works outside the State and pays tax in the other jurisdiction in order to qualify for the relief.</p>  <p>  In the event that the existing arrangements were to be revisited and done so specifically for Northern Ireland border workers, a number of issues could arise including in relation to equity between Irish residents in respect of employments carried out in Ireland, the competitive position of Irish employers, concerns regarding the potential for double non-taxation and established principles of international tax.</p>  <p>  Any such consideration would also need to be examined in the overall context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership, noting that it would likely not be possible for Ireland to give preferential treatment to UK based employments or Northern Ireland based employments only without also giving similar treatment to other EU Member States or DTA jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  As is the case with all taxation matters, this position will be kept under review especially in the context of Brexit.  However, I would assure the Deputies that in circumstances where this relief does not apply, relief for foreign tax may be applicable in the normal course set out above.</p></reply>

The details are set out in Finance Bill 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are available on the Revenue website: ().  </p><p>The support is available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an events company or destination management company, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria. Similarly artists, musicians, taxi drivers and live entertainment workers are not eligible.</p><p>The CRSS is targeted at businesses whose premises are affected by the restrictions.  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  However, where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the business may qualify for the CRSS.</p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b></b>Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the and the and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support  particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas and I have no plans to extend eligibility of the scheme.</p></reply>

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth holds primary responsible for reporting back to the UN Committee, in coordination with Government Departments and other civil society stakeholders. </p><p>It is understood that tax policy was added to the List of Issues Report for Ireland arising from a submission from some NGOs. The inference that Ireland&rsquo;s tax policies is negatively impacting on resources for the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights in developing countries is unjustified, and misrepresents Ireland&rsquo;s role in international tax reform and development.</p><p>Ireland has been a strong supporter of international tax reform and development. </p><p>First, Ireland joined the Addis Tax Initiative in February 2017 which is an international commitment to strengthen international cooperation in the area of tax and development. In this context, Ireland launched a <i>Domestic Resource Mobilisation</i>(DRM) initiative in 2019 to promote good tax governance in developing countries. DRM is a whole of government collaboration between my own Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to strengthen partner countries&rsquo; tax administrative capacity. It aims to support these countries in raising revenue fairly and effectively, through equitable and inclusive means, while also promoting good governance.</p><p>Ireland's long-term support of the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) was recognised at the 2019 General Assembly of ATAF, where Ireland was awarded a 'Most Valued Development Partner' award.</p><p>Second, Ireland was one of the first countries to commission an independent spill-over analysis of the impact of our tax system on developing countries. This project included: an analysis of trade and capital flows between Ireland and developing countries; an analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty network with developing countries; and review of relevant provisions in domestic tax legislation. This 2015 report concluded that there was no negative spill-overs from the Irish tax regime, or Ireland&rsquo;s modern tax treaties, on the economies of developing countries.</p><p>Third, as regards the international tax framework, there have been significant developments in recent years through the OECD BEPS process. Ireland has been fully supportive of this process and has introduced legislation to implement it. I hope that further progress will be made at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS as planned by mid-2021. </p><p>Ireland's response to the Committee is due by 30 October 2021. I welcome this opportunity to inform the Committee of how Ireland's approach to tax policy is contributing to Ireland's obligations with regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></reply>

This pathway will deliver job opportunities to sectors and regions most affected by the transition away from a dependence on fossil fuels starting, with the midlands peat producing areas, and ensuring that vulnerable groups are helped, as transformative policies are developed and implemented.  Achievement of these objectives will require the anticipation of challenges and planning for responses to them. The Programme for Government includes a number of specific commitments in relation to addressing this work, including:</p>  <p>  - publishing a detailed all-of-Government implementation plan consistent with the recommendations of the first report of the Just Transition Commissioner;</p>  <p>  - establishing a standing Office of the Just Transition Commissioner, with appropriate staffing and resources; </p>  <p>  - addressing the need to plan for just transition by identifying and preparing for challenges that will arise in a number of sectors and regions;</p>  <p>  - ensuring that financing is available and continue to grow the size of the Just Transition Fund.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building upon the work of a number of different organisations in further developing its policy on Just Transition and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments. </p>  <p>  As part of this approach, and as announced on Budget Day 2021, every single additional Euro raised by the increase in the Carbon Tax will be returned to citizens through a package of supports to protect vulnerable people, to secure a Just Transition, and to reduce our Carbon footprint.  For Budget 2021, this included increases to energy efficiency schemes targeted at energy poverty, and the continuation of Carbon Tax investment programmes funded through Budget 2020 such as the Just Transition Fund.</p>  <p>  I would further highlight to the Deputy that the policy of Just Transition is under the responsibility of the Minister for Environment, Climate, and Communication.  </p></reply>

Key to this process will be trying to balance improvements for borrowers with the potential for unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion, if the supply of credit is reduced.</p>  <p>  Once I has seen these proposals and considered them, my officials will liaise with the relevant Government Departments to seek consensus for a whole of government approach for the introduction of an interest rate cap and other regulatory changes. </p>  <p>  In view of the ongoing work in my Department on this issue, I will not be supporting the Deputy's Bill at this point.</p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.</p>  <p>  The Bill as published provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The Bill also introduces a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties facing retailers, especially businesses in the tourism sector, I am bringing forward an amendment at committee stage to reduce the threshold to &euro;75. This reduction retains protections for the exchequer while also acknowledging the potential impact that not making this change would have on retailers across the country at this difficult time.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that it takes a multifaceted approach to ensuring compliance by employers with the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a risk focused real-time examination of EWSS submissions as they are made to Revenue. Revenue engages with employers where Revenue has grounds to believe that an employer may have made a genuine error in respect of a submission.  In addition, the risk control systems operated by Revenue result in real time engagement with employers where certain data validation or confirmation rules are triggered by reference to the data submitted. Such triggers have to be resolved before Revenue will certify payment of a claim by an employer. </p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation enacted by the Oireachtas contains a number of important safeguards, such as the requirement that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances.  Following such a review, if an employer no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>  Section 28B (6) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 includes specific anti-abuse measures in relation to EWSS. These measures underpin the necessity for employers to operate the scheme as intended by the legislation. They serve as a disincentive for any employer to enter into contrived non bona fide arrangements with employees, which are purely designed to maximise the benefits from the scheme by way of subsidy payments and PRSI credits claimed from Revenue.  </p>  <p>  Serious sanctions may be imposed where Revenue determines that an employer incorrectly claimed and received a subsidy payment, by engaging in unacceptable behaviour constituting an abuse of the scheme.  This includes applying inappropriate accounting practices to deliberately misrepresent the true financial situation of the business. Such sanctions include &ndash; total exclusion from the scheme, all subsidies paid and PRSI credit issued in respect of all employees having to be repaid, together with interest and penalties, and the business may also face criminal prosecution. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue carried out a comprehensive review of compliance with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). While this review is not finished, it found a very high level of compliance with the terms of the scheme. This is very important. Both wage subsidy schemes are emergency and unprecedented measures to support businesses through the economic challenges posed by the pandemic; the schemes have allowed businesses to keep going and have supported employment by helping businesses keep the link with their employees. It is critically important that employers abide by the terms and conditions and I am assured by Revenue that, in the vast majority of cases, this is the case.  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s approach represents an appropriate balance between supporting businesses in accordance with the terms of the EWSS scheme and ensuring that there is a compliance framework in place that identifies and sanctions any serious non-compliance or abuse.</p></reply>

Modified domestic demand, perhaps the best indicator of domestic economic activity, declined by 16 per cent while the unemployment rate &ndash; including recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) &ndash; peaked at 30 per cent in April. However, as restrictions were eased over the summer the economy began to recover with the number of unemployed falling steadily and other indicators, including retail sales, showing a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. </p>  <p>  At the time of the Budget, my Department projected that GDP would decline by -2&frac12; per cent this year. This was based on a number of assumptions, including that there would be no return to a national lockdown.</p>  <p>  However, on the 22nd October the country entered Level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19. My Department estimated that these restrictions would see GDP decline by 3&frac12; per cent this year around 1 percentage point lower than the baseline scenario.  While the impact of this move to increased restrictions is likely to be significant, I am optimistic that the economic fall-out will not be as severe as in this scenario, as construction, education and most manufacturing activity will remain open under these restrictions. </p>  <p>  Next year, my Department are projecting that the economy grow by around 1&frac34; per cent. This projection is based on the assumption that the UK would leave the current transition period with the EU without a trade deal being agreed and that a widespread vaccine would not be available before the end of 2021. Of course, if these assumptions do not come to pass then there will be some upside to this projection. </p>  <p>  As we chart our way forward through these uncertain times, careful management of the public finances is needed. Indeed, finding the correct balance between protecting the health of our population while also supporting the economy will be crucial. </p></reply>

In order for a zero rate of VAT to be applied to a good or service, that good or service must have applied at the zero rate on 1 January 1991 and have continued to apply at that rate since. No new items may be charged at the zero rate, where they had not been subject to the zero rate before 1991. In Ireland the zero VAT rate applies to oral medicines, including oral medicines for animals, as they were subject to the zero rate on and since 1 January 1991.  However, non-oral medicines were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, so it is not legally possible to apply the zero rate to them now.</p>  <p>  However, Ireland has been supportive of measures to respond to COVID-19 in the area of VAT. These measures include relief on VAT at import of goods to combat the outbreak, and the zero-rating to the supply and intra-community acquisition of PPE, hand sanitiser, thermometers, oxygen and the like, and were implemented by the Revenue Commissioners as part of Ireland's response to the public health emergency. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the European Commission has recently presented a proposal to provide for relief from VAT for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines when available, as well as testing kits.

The <i>Ireland for Finance</i>strategy is the successor to the IFS2020 strategy and a succession of Government strategies for the development of the sector in Ireland.

This letter was issued by the Bank in the performance of its regulatory functions under current legislation. That letter was preceded by a letter issued by the Bank in 2019 on F&amp;P issues which was followed by inspections across a sample of financial services firms. </p>  <p>  The Fitness &amp;amp; Probity Regime was introduced under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. It is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulatory powers to ensure that senior personnel in regulated financial service providers are competent, suitably qualified, financially sound and, most importantly, honest and ethical in their behaviour. </p>  <p>  Inspections by the Central Bank found, in many cases, a number of issues, including a poor level of awareness by Board members of their fitness and probity obligations, and consistently weak due diligence. Where roles were outsourced, there was a failure to ensure that F&amp;P standards were properly applied. Thus while the majority of firms had compliance frameworks, policies and procedures in place, given the findings of the inspections, it was clear that many firms were not undertaking robust compliance testing of their fitness and probity processes and procedures.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that financial services providers are compliant with all aspects of the F&amp;P regime. I understand the Central Bank will continue to assess the robustness of firms&rsquo; application of the F&amp;P Regime and will initiate supervisory responses to any weaknesses identified.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), which will be the centrepiece of the forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will also contain a range of measures to strengthen and enhance the Fitness and Probity Regime, which will add to the Central Bank&rsquo;s abilities to ensure effective compliance by regulated firms. These will include a requirement that firms certify annually that all staff performing Controlled Functions meet the required F&amp;P standards. This will help address the issues of non-compliance that the Central Bank has highlighted. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging with the Attorney General's Office in advance of submitting draft heads of Bill to Government so as to ensure that the correct balance is struck between appropriate additional powers for the Central Bank and the protection of individuals' constitutional rights.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that draft heads of Bill will be presented to Government for approval in the near future.</p></reply>

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no reliable basis available on which to estimate the potential cost of the introduction of a tax relief as described by the Deputy.  However, according to Census 2016 data, the private rented sector amounts to approximately 310,000 units.  This figure includes those in receipt of rental support from the State. It is clear, therefore, that the costs involved would be likely to be very significant.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p>  <p>  Finally, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax.  </p>  <p>  I have, therefore, no plans at present to propose the introduction of rent relief or a rent tax credit.   </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. </p>  <p>  The European Banking Authority (EBA) also introduced COVID-19 guidelines in the spring with the objective of setting out the requirements for the public and private moratoria introduced across the European Union which, if fulfilled, would help avoid the classification of exposures as forborne or defaulted under distressed restructuring.  Most EU Member States introduced payment breaks, some on a voluntary basis like Ireland, some on a legislative basis, and in several countries there was a mix with multiple schemes with varying eligibility requirements, conditions and timeframes.  However, the overall key objective was to provide financial relief to borrowers by allowing a suspension or postponement of payments within a specified period.  The moratorium introduced in Ireland complied with the EBA guidelines and was a welcome voluntary initiative that allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers who have finished a payment break have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers, including mortgage borrowers, SMEs and microbusinesses, continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and the SME lending regulations, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.  The Central Bank has also confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations. Regarding SMEs in particular, lenders are to provide appropriate supports to SME borrowers to help them to assess the longer-term effects on their businesses. While some enterprises will have had unsustainable business models notwithstanding COVID-19, measures which provide time for firms to adjust to COVID-19 conditions &ndash; or to assess whether their business models remain viable &ndash; are particularly useful during a period of substantial uncertainty and the Central Bank notes that they also allow lenders to make more informed decisions on a firm&rsquo;s viability.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Central Credit Register (CCR), it is important to note that the CCR does not produce credit ratings rather its purpose is to provide factual information to lenders and borrowers on a borrower&rsquo;s credit record. The Central Bank has also advised lenders that in their reporting to the CCR, they will need to apply judgement around whether a restructure has been agreed in response to an identification of financial distress. </p></reply>

The estimated cost arises from both an increase in public expenditure and a decline in tax receipts. There is a considerable amount of uncertainty in relation to this estimate, depending on, inter alia, individual take-up, firm-level decisions and sector specific impacts.</p><p>Reflecting a steep fall in personal consumption, the previous period of the most stringent restrictions led to a significant decline in VAT and Excise duties. I expect the same will happen in respect to the latest restrictions, although some of the high frequency data published by the Department show the impact is likely to be less severe than in the spring.</p><p>A further consideration is the operation of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). In the past two months, tax receipts have been withheld by the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate payments under the scheme, which was announced by the Government in <i>Budget 2021 </i>to provide support to businesses that are affected by the restrictions. As such, the CRSS 'artificially' dampens tax receipts.</p><p>VAT is the primary channel through which the impact of level 5 will be felt on tax receipts. As it is paid with a two-month lag, the likely impact will not be known until January receipts are collected. </p><p>I will publish the taxation receipts for the fourth quarter early in the new year. </p></reply>

It commenced on 1 October 2020. The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple. </p>  <p>  The scheme is due to operate until 30 April next year but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date.  However, it is too early as yet to take any decisions in that regard.  Much will depend on how matters unfold in the weeks and months ahead. As I have said previously, I will be monitoring the scheme, to see how it&rsquo;s working and if any changes need to be made. We need to keep policies that are working, and change ones that might not be working as planned, but at all times, ensuring they are affordable.</p>  <p>  In relation to non-taxpayers or those who may not have a sufficient tax liability to avail of the scheme, within the tax system, the normal position is that a tax credit can only benefit a person who has an income tax liability. For the Stay and Spend scheme, however, special arrangements have been made to extend the potential benefit as widely as possible so that, even where a person does not have an income tax liability, he or she may still benefit by virtue of having a USC liability.  There are no plans to further broaden out the scheme in this regard. </p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that the scheme should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. The VAT change; the rates waiver; the extension of the wage support scheme until next year and its extension to new or seasonal staff; and other Government measures all play a part in helping the sector cope with the challenges it faces.</p></reply>

For example, interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.64% in September of this year.  </p>  <p>  However, when the full context is considered, it should be noted that Irish loans, particularly Irish mortgages, can have different characteristics from those offered by other EU banks making direct comparison of these rates inconsistent. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Irish mortgages are also not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, and which can result in lower headline rates elsewhere in the EU.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which determine the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank has a range of particular measures to protect consumers who are taking out a residential mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  As noted above, it is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p>  <p>  Regarding Ulster Bank and its continued involvement in the Irish banking market, I met with representatives of Ulster Bank on the 21st of October. I outlined that I expected that staff, customers and other stakeholders would be informed promptly about any decisions being made. I also emphasised the importance of Ulster Bank to the Irish financial services market, to the wider economy and to the communities it serves. </p>  <p>  In response, Ulster Bank confirmed that the strategic review is ongoing and that no decision has yet been taken. Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.  </p>  <p>  While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it. My officials will nevertheless continue to monitor developments.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of the State using its shareholding in the banking sector to maximise competition, as the Deputy will be aware, the particular banks in which the State has a shareholding interest remain distinct market entities and they continue to provide an important competitive presence in the savings and loans markets.  In support of this overall competitive approach,  and in accordance with the commercial independence of those banks as provided for in the Relationship Frameworks agreements with those particular banks and which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally, the commercial decision making of each of these institutions is a matter for the boards and management of each of those institutions in the same way as it is for the other banks and lenders operating in the Irish market.</p></reply>

SURE provides a refund of tax paid in the previous 6 tax years to those in PAYE employment or those recently unemployed, where they invest funds into a new company set up by them.</p><p>The general conditions for SURE are that you must:</p><p>- establish a new company carrying on a new qualifying trading activity,</p><p>- have mainly PAYE income in the previous four years,</p><p>- take up full-time employment in the new company as a director or an employee,</p><p>- invest cash in the new company by purchasing new ordinary shares, and  </p><p>- keep the purchased shares for at least four years.</p><p>A review of SURE was carried out and changes to the administration of the scheme were implemented in Finance Act 2018.  From 1 January 2019 qualifying companies can submit applications for eligible SURE investments on a self-assessment basis.

A company can satisfy itself that it qualifies for SURE and, accordingly, obtain certification on a self-assessment basis via the Revenue Online Service (&lsquo;ROS&rsquo;). </p><p>While I have no plans at the present time for further changes to the scheme, these matters are kept under regular review. </p></reply>

The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments were made to the Section 481 tax credit as part of Finance Act 2018. The certification process was amended, production companies are now required to apply to apply to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) before commencement of Irish production to have the film certified as a qualifying film. </p>  <p>  As part of the application process, applicants must provide a skills development plan and, if the amount of eligible expenditure is over &euro;2m, that plan must be agreed with Screen Ireland. A post project skills development report is also required for each project.</p>  <p>  As part of the certification process undertaken by DTCAGSM, an applicant company is required to sign an undertaking of compliance with all relevant employment legislation. This undertaking is required to be signed and furnished with every section 481 application. These conditions shall be met by both the producer company and the qualifying company. If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister they may not be eligible for the corporation tax credit.  Any amount already claimed may be recoverable, with interest.</p>  <p>  Adjudication of adherence to employment legislation is not within the remit of the Minister for Finance, however the importance of adhering to employment legislation has been reinforced by introducing the undertaking in respect of quality employment. The monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the Workplace Relations Committee (WRC). Should the WRC determine that a company in receipt of section 481 tax relief has not complied with the relevant employment rights legislation, as stated, any amounts claimed may be recoverable with interest.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the WRC completed an audit of the Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector this year, following a joint request by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Services, Industry, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU), and Screen Producers Ireland.  The report, which was published in August, contains four recommendations, none of which are recommendations for changes to be made to Section 481. However the audit does recommend that a formal agreement between the majority of workers and employers, addressing pay, terms and conditions, would be beneficial for the industry. I understand that negotiations in this regard are currently ongoing between Screen Producers Ireland and the unions (of which the Guilds are also a part) and I am informed that the agreement should be finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  As stated above, the creation of quality employment opportunities is a policy objective of the film credit and I have made a number of changes to the legislation in recent years to support this objective.  My officials are following the progress in respect of the WRC recommendations and I will take further actions to support the key objectives of the credit in future if necessary.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-26a.283.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112600058#WRF03300"><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) is a statutory Code issued pursuant to Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989. The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the Code under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The provisions of the Code are binding on regulated entities and must, at all times, be complied with by regulated entities.</p><p>The Code is a key component of the strong consumer protection framework in place for consumers of regulated financial service providers. The Code sets out the requirements that regulated entities must comply with when dealing with consumers in order to ensure a similar level of protection for consumers, regardless of the type of financial services provider. The Code sets out important protections in a range of areas, including in relation to pre-contractual and post-sale information, assessing suitability, claims processing, error and complaints resolution, arrears handling and advertising.</p><p>Since 2012, the Code has been strengthened a number of times, <i>via addenda</i>, to provide additional protections for consumers. These amendments include new requirements around variable rate mortgages, mortgage switching measures, and intermediary inducements. </p><p>A review of the Code is currently underway by the Central Bank.  A public consultation on the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals for amendments will take place in 2021 giving all stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions. This review will also include transferring the Code into regulations in line with the regulation making powers given to the Central Bank in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. </p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that it continues to give focus to the Consumer Protection Codes in both its supervisory and enforcement work.</p><p>It is important to note that the Central Bank&rsquo;s work to protect consumers is delivered across the entirety of the Bank, and is not just confined to the Code. The breadth of its mandate enables it to harness its collective wide-ranging policy, economic, financial stability and regulatory expertise in working to protect consumers.  The stability of the system, and the resilience of firms within it, are as essential in protecting consumers and investors as our statutory codes of conduct, policy development, assertive supervision, authorisation gatekeeping and robust enforcement powers.</p><p>On the issue of enforcement, it is not the case that there has been a lack of enforcement action. </p><p>The Central Bank has a broad range of tools, which it carefully deploys in appropriate circumstances, including the imposition of sanctions but up to and including the revocation of authorisations and the refusal and prohibition of individuals. The Central Bank has taken a number of actions in these areas in furtherance of its consumer protection mandate.  </p><p>Since 2006 the Central Bank has concluded 139 cases under its Administrative Sanctions Procedure framework with fines imposed of &euro;123.98m. Of the 139 outcomes, 22 were imposed against individuals. The Central Bank has also taken action to revoke 28 firms&rsquo; authorisations on an involuntary basis. A further 13 firms were refused authorisation to undertake regulated activities. </p><p>While its enforcement work spans the entirety of its mandate and is wider than the Code alone, the Central Bank has a strong enforcement record in respect of outcomes which are integral to the Code. In this regard, the two largest monetary sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank &ndash; Permanent TSB plc sanctioned &euro;21million in 2019 and KBC Bank Ireland plc sanctioned &euro;18.3million in 2020 - evidence the Central Bank&rsquo;s commitment to taking robust enforcement action with real deterrence value where serious and significant breaches of the Code are committed. </p><p>Ultimately for all cases, whether they are specifically based on a breach of the Code, or another sector of legislation, it is important to note that while a case may not have been settled under the Code, protecting consumers is at the centre of all of the Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement outcomes. </p><p>Regarding legislation to strengthen consumer protection, the Programme for Government includes a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), which will be the centrepiece of the forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.  The key focus of this legislation is to drive positive behaviour and encourage a culture of high standards that delivers better and fairer outcomes for consumers.</p><p>Officials in my Department are currently engaging with the Attorney General's Office in advance of submitting draft heads of Bill to Government so as to ensure that the correct balance is struck between appropriate additional powers for the Central Bank and the protection of individuals' constitutional rights.</p><p>It is my intention that draft heads of Bill will be presented to Government for approval in the near future. </p></reply>

From a tax perspective, this relates to tax, USC and PRSI collected through the PAYE system. The implication for the individuals is that they do not have the benefit of certain employment related entitlements such as rates of pay, holiday pay or sick pay.  In addition, as the rate of PRSI paid as a self-employed person differs from that payable by an employee, this affects an individual&rsquo;s entitlements to certain social welfare benefits.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that a worker&rsquo;s employment status is not a matter of choice; it depends on the terms and conditions of the job. While it is usually clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed, it is not always obvious. However, case law has established tests to determine whether contracts are contracts for service (i.e. self-employed contractor) or contracts of service (i.e. employee). These tests need to be applied on a case by case basis to the fact pattern of each case. </p>  <p>  Revenue also advise that in addition to the pure &ldquo;bogus self-employment&rdquo; phenomenon other service provision arrangements have emerged that are sometimes, and somewhat loosely, included within the term &ldquo;bogus self-employment&rdquo;. These are generally referred to as &ldquo;intermediary structures&rdquo; and include engagement of workers through &ldquo;Personal Service Companies&rdquo; (PSCs) and &ldquo;Managed Service Companies&rdquo; (MSCs). There are significant differences in company law treatment, social welfare treatment and tax treatment between the pure &ldquo;bogus self-employment&rdquo; phenomenon and the related corporate forms. </p>  <p>  My Department, as part of a working group along with officials from the Department of Social Protection (DSP), with technical assistance from Revenue, published a report in January 2018 titled &ldquo;The use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements: Implications for Social Insurance and Tax Revenues&rdquo;. That report looked to identify and estimate any potential loss of tax and PRSI resulting from intermediary type structures and self-employment arrangements. </p>  <p>  Revenue advises me that it monitors developments in labour market trends in conjunction with the DSP, with a view to seeing whether the Code of Practice and the rules around establishing employment and self-employment remain &ldquo;fit for purpose&rdquo; for construction and other sectors. As part of that ongoing work, Revenue are assisting DSP in developing a new Code for Determining Employment or Self-employment which is expected to be finalised early in 2021. </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue advise me that its compliance interventions include a focus on the practice of bogus self-employment and challenging the inappropriate classification of workers as self-employed contractors. I believe that Revenue has the powers necessary to fully investigate potential cases of bogus self-employment. </p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government which identifies a range of issues that need to be tackled on a Whole-of-Government basis.  This ambitious reform agenda is being led by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  It is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and includes Ministers McGrath, McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman, Ministers of State Troy and Fleming and myself as standing members.  I strongly believe this cross-departmental approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) which produced two primary reports, the first on the cost of motor insurance and the second on the cost of employer and public liability insurance. </p><p>My Department published the CIWG&rsquo;s Eleventh and Final Progress Update Report on 30 October.  This illustrated that the vast majority of recommendations had been completed.  It was also noted that taking account of the new Whole-of-Government approach, that the outstanding CIWG recommendations will now be implemented through the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  In that context, the four outstanding recommendations from the CIWG&rsquo;s Motor Insurance report, including the reason for their delay, are as follows:</p><p><i>- Recommendation 16 &ndash; Ascertain and set out the measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases:</i>The Department of Justice has advised that draft regulations on PAPs for medical negligence actions remain under discussion with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC).  It has advised that they intend to move this work forward as a matter of urgency.  The finalisation of these Regulations will then inform the work on the PAPs for personal injuries actions.</p><p><i>- Recommendation 22 &ndash; Examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards:</i>The implementation of this recommendation was contingent on the establishment of the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators (OLCA), as provided for under the <i>Legal Services Regulation Act 2015</i>. The OLCA came into operation with effect from 7 October 2019.  The Department of Justice has outlined that a period of at least one to two years from the time this new body became operational will be required before they will have an appropriate data baseline to commence a meaningful review.</p><p><i>- Recommendation 24 &ndash; Examine the setting of the discount rate (in personal injury lump sum awards), without prejudice to the outcome of relevant proceedings, and to be reviewed at regular intervals:</i>The Department of Justice recently ran a public consultation and will provide a report once its review of the discount rate has concluded in the context of the new reform agenda.</p><p><i>- Recommendation 25 &ndash; Establish a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud:</i>This recommendation has been delayed as a result of a number of data protection issues.  These are currently being examined by the Department of Justice and other stakeholders.</p><p>Notwithstanding these outstanding recommendations, the Deputy will be aware that many positive reforms have been introduced to address the cost and availability of insurance through the CIWG.  These include legislation to: strengthen the role of PIAB; to clarify and widen the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund; to provide access to information regarding claims; to provide more information to consumers at renewal; and to make it easier for businesses to challenge fraudulent claims.  The cumulative impact of these changes has undoubtedly been a factor in helping to reduce motor premiums over the last number of years. The most recent CSO data indicates that the cost of motor insurance is now almost a third lower than it was at its peak in July 2016.  </p><p>In conclusion, the CIWG&rsquo;s remaining recommendations will be part of the Cabinet Sub-group&rsquo;s work.  The Deputy can rest assured that seeking to secure sustainable competition through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and I will play a lead role to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.</p></reply>

Louth are currently registered for customs and therefore have an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number.  I am also advised by Revenue that 94% of imports from and 99% of exports to the UK in 2019 undertaken by businesses in Co. Louth were undertaken by businesses that have an EORI number.</p>  <p>  An EORI number is an essential prerequisite for businesses to be able to undertake trade with or through the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, from 1 January 2021. I understand that to assist businesses in the customs registration process Revenue has published a helpful step-by-step guidance video on its website.</p>  <p>   I strongly urge all businesses that will be impacted by Brexit to use the short time available between now and 1 January 2021 to put in place the necessary arrangements that will enable them to be able to undertake trade with and through the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, from that date. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the whole of Government work of engaging with business to assist them in their Brexit preparations. The 225,000 letters that the Deputy refers to were issued by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar, T.D. to all companies registered with the Companies Registration Office. The letter sets out what a company needs to do to get its business ready for the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January 2021.</p>  <p>  As regards additional resources for Revenue, I can advise the Deputy that Revenue initially determined that it required 600 additional staff. The Government approved this Brexit related recruitment in September 2018. In the period between September 2018 and October 2019, Revenue assigned over 580 staff to Brexit related roles.  In light of the experience gained over the last 18 months and the need for a strong focus on measures to combat illegitimate trade, a risk that will be enhanced from 1 January 2021, Revenue recently re-assessed its requirements and determined that it will require approx. 300 staff in addition to the 600 already approved. Revenue is currently recruiting and training these staff. I am also advised by Revenue that as an integrated tax and customs administration, it will deploy resources to quickly confront any risks as they emerge.</p></reply>

In this context &lsquo;capacity&rsquo; means having sufficient access to the internet and circumstances where a person is prevented by reason of age or infirmity (mental or physical) from using online services. </p>  <p>  For taxpayers who are not obliged to file online for the reasons outlined, Revenue provides paper returns and alternative payment options to assist them in meeting their filing obligations.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-26a.302.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112600059#WRG01100"><p>At the outset, policy in relation to driving tests and any decision to postpone tests, are a matter for the Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan TD.  In relation to insurance refunds for learner drivers, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  While I have a full understanding that learner drivers have not been able to take their test as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles, including those with learner permits.  </p>  <p>  However, I believe that insurers are a fundamental part of the financial services sector and they have a major role to play in ensuring that their customers are treated fairly in these very difficult times.  In view of this, at a meeting on 17 April with Insurance Ireland, I called on insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers.  In this regard, I pointed out that a combination of the profitable private motor insurance market over the last 18 months and what is likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period due to COVID 19 related travel restrictions, provided a strong case for premium refunds, thus providing some financial relief to their customers during this extraordinary time.  On 24 April, Insurance Ireland announced that a number of their members: Allianz; AXA; FBD; RSA; and Zurich had signed up to commitments on premium reliefs for motor customers.  In addition, Liberty Insurance wrote to me directly informing me of discounts that it would apply to its customers.  </p>  <p>  Finally, while the amounts provided by way of rebate were small and applied across the board, it would be my expectation that drivers with a learner permit should have been similarly treated.  Ultimately, however, I believe that those learner drivers impacted by the restrictions, have the option to shop around for better prices and service from their insurer upon renewal.  In this regard, I believe they will remember and favour those companies that have made steps towards meeting their needs at this difficult time.   </p></reply>

The scheme was not intended as a support to domestic employers nor was it ever implied that it applied to them.   </p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Revenue also deployed very significant resources to a TWSS Helpline to ensure employers were supported to the greatest extent possible through telephone and written (including e-mail) engagement.  </p>  <p>  The provision of domestic duties by an employee within a private household where the employer is the owner or occupier is not a business activity for the purposes of the scheme. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing domestic staff. It is also not possible for a domestic employer to meet the &lsquo;25% turnover&rsquo; eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging a domestic employee.</p>  <p>  In the event that any employers, including domestic employers, received TWSS payments to which they were not entitled, it is very important that they engage with Revenue and agree repayment arrangements. Where this does not happen, it may result in Revenue raising assessments and deploying debt collection sanctions to secure the repayments. </p>  <p>  From the perspective of the employee, questions relating to an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, what wages an employer may be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of their employment contract, hours worked and an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are all matters that are outside the remit of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The question in relation to applications for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

These projections were based on the assumption that targeted measures would be introduced in response to any further pick-up in the Covid19 infection rate; crucially, it was assumed that there would not be a second national lockdown.  However, in light of the deteriorating public health situation, the country moved to Level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid19 on October 22<sup>nd</sup>. </p><p>A downside scenario analysis published in the Budget estimated that more stringent restrictions in the fourth quarter would see GDP contract by about -3&frac12; per cent this year, about 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline scenario. </p><p>Although the fall-out from the latest restrictions will undoubtedly be significant, the economic impact is unlikely to be as severe as in this scenario or as that seen during the first lockdown earlier this year, as construction, education, childcare and most manufacturing activity remain open. Indeed, while some of the ultra-high frequency indicators that the Department monitors, such as payment card transactions and mobility data, have fallen since the restrictions were introduced, the falls have not been as severe as in the spring. </p><p>The introduction of these restrictions has, however, meant that many additional people now rely on income support schemes. The number of recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) stood at 352,000 as of November 23rd &ndash; an increase of around 108,000 since level 5 restrictions were introduced. However, the rate of increase in the number of recipients has slowed in recent weeks and with more sectors remaining open compared to the spring, the number of people claiming the PUP should remain well below the peak of 600,000 recorded in early May.</p><p>Additionally, while the recent move to level 5 means that the contraction of the economy this year may be greater than anticipated at the time of the Budget, it is possible that a better-than-expected performance in the third quarter, as suggested by retail sales, construction and exports data, could offset some of the impacts of these restrictions on the overall annual figures. </p></reply>

You will be aware that, as Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions. Under Section 149 of the <i>Consumer Credit Act 1995 </i>(the Act), as amended, the responsibility for the regulation of bank fees lies with the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that under Section 149 of the Act, a credit institution must notify the Central Bank if they wish to:</p><p>- Introduce any new customer charge for providing certain services; or</p><p>- Increase any existing customer charge for providing certain services.</p><p>Each notification received by the Central Bank is assessed and robustly challenged in accordance with the specific criteria set out in Section 149 of the Act. Having considered the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria as set out under the legislation, the charges are either rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the credit institution, or approved in full.  Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive charges at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons.</p><p>Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Consumer Protection Code</i>, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect. If customers are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost, they have the right to switch to a different provider. </p><p>The Central Bank has clearly expressed its expectations that all regulated firms take a consumer-focused approach and act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times. The Central Bank encourages regulated firms to take all possible measures to assist their customers during this difficult time and to help them to the greatest extent possible while they work through this public health emergency. </p><p>I would encourage all bank customers, particularly those adversely affected by changes in bank charges, to shop around and compare the fees and benefits of the different current accounts available.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website provides useful information to assist customers to compare and switch accounts; this website can be accessed at . </p><p>Under the <i>Payment Accounts Directive</i>, all Irish banks must make available a basic bank account for people who currently do not have access to a bank account. The basic bank account is free of charge for everyday banking services for the first year. After 12 months, the credit institution may review the amounts lodged to the account over the preceding 12 months, and, where the total of those amounts exceeds the equivalent of the national minimum hourly rate of pay multiplied by 2,080, the credit institution may charge a reasonable fee for the account. The consumer must be given two months&rsquo; notice before any such reasonable fee may be imposed.</p><p>The <i>Payment Accounts Directive</i>also requires that a consumer must be provided with a Fee Information Document setting out all fees linked to an account, in good time before entering into a framework contract with a consumer. A consumer must also be provided, at least annually, with a Statement of Fees, setting out all fees incurred in respect of the account. These requirements ensure the consumer is fully informed of all fees linked to a payment account. Where a consumer wishes to switch payment accounts, the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Code of Conduct on the Switching of Payment Accounts with Payment Service Providers 2016</i>sets out the requirements that both the existing and new account provider must adhere to when undertaking the switching process.</p></reply>

This approval was subject to the Minister and the Bank entering into the Relationship Framework on terms agreed by the European Commission.

For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Irish mortgages are also not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, and which can result in lower EU headline rates.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

This approval was subject to the Minister and the Bank entering into the Relationship Framework on terms approved by the European Commission.  One of the reasons for this was to ensure that the Minister&rsquo;s shareholding did not result in breaches of competition law rules.  </p>  <p>  Critically, and as set out in the Relationship Framework, any amendments to, or revocation or replacement of, the Relationship Framework must be made following consultation with AIB and upon the instruction, or with the agreement, of the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  As is clearly set out in the Relationship Framework, the board of AIB has full responsibility and authority for all of the operations of the bank in accordance with its legal, fiduciary, and regulatory obligations.  The Relationship Framework further provides for safeguards as to the separate management of each of the State&rsquo;s interests in Irish credit institutions (including in the Bank) in order to ensure that those interests, and the management of those interests, do not lead to a prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in contravention of merger control or competition law rules.</p>  <p>  It is therefore the case that any proposed amendment to the Relationship Framework must not only be in accordance with the regulatory requirements under which AIB operates, the State Agreements more particularly set out in the Relationship Framework, and the law, the proposed amendments must also be approved by the European Commission following consultation with AIB.</p></reply>

This includes the measures brought forward through Budget 2021, which is based on a no deal Brexit scenario. In particular, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme offered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The SBCI also offers a Credit Guarantee Scheme to firms who may need it in order to secure a Comprehensive Guarantee for transit purposes. My Department is also collaborating with the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA to monitor and support readiness preparations in the financial services sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with businesses since 2018 to provide information and guidance on the impacts that Brexit could have and how to mitigate the risks. In September this year, Revenue wrote to approx. 90,000 businesses who traded with the UK during 2019 or in the first half of 2020. These are businesses who if they want to continue such trade, either by way of imports or exports or both, with the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, after 1 January, will need to take action to ensure their Brexit readiness. The letter included a Brexit readiness checklist and outlined a range of steps to be taken to get Brexit ready. As part of this intensified engagement, Revenue also targeted some 14,500 businesses (of the 90,000) for follow up telephone contact. The businesses contacted were identified as the most likely to be significantly impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  Revenue live-streamed a two-day series of Brexit information sessions for business on 5 and 6 October 2020. These sessions provided important information on topics such as Customs, VAT, Excise and VRT, to help businesses to get ready for trading with or through Great Britain from 1 January 2021. Recordings of these sessions can be viewed on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/brexit.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Revenue has participated in Brexit related events hosted by other Government Departments and in business and trade representative group events. The purpose of these events is to engage directly with traders, addressing their concerns, outlining the key steps they need to take to ensure that goods can move as efficiently as possible post-Brexit, and advising them of the requirements for simplified Customs procedures. I understand that Revenue is continuing its programme of stakeholder (trade and representative body) engagement including, in particular, engagement with IBEC, the haulage and logistics sector and ferry operators. </p>  <p>  The Revenue website continues to be updated with specific information that outlines the obligations on businesses throughout the supply chain and offers them guidance on steps to take to meet the post-Brexit requirements.</p>  <p>  As a result of Revenue&rsquo;s engagement activity there has been a noticeable increase in registrations for a Customs Economic Operators Registration Identification (EORI) number. There were 32,000 EORI registrations in total since 2019. To assist businesses to register for an EORI number Revenue  provided a helpful step by step guidance video for businesses on its website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue and the Department have made very significant efforts to get businesses to engage with the challenge of Brexit. I strongly urge all businesses that will be impacted by Brexit to use the short time available between now and 1 January 2021 to put in place the necessary arrangements that will enable them to be able to undertake trade with and through the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, from that date. </p></reply>

In County Leitrim, there are 22,443 premises of which 11,595 (52 %) are within the intervention area.  The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. </p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 16 November, over 131,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Surveys have been completed in County Sligo in the areas of Ballintogher, Ballysadare, Calry, Carney, Collooney, Drumcliff, Kilmacowen, Rosses Point, Rahaberna, Lisduff, Clogherevagh, Tobercurry, Ballymote, the outskirts of Sligo Town, Enniscrone, Aghamore Near, Carrowcrin, Strandhill, Culshera and Kilmactranny.  Further surveys are planned in the area of Castlegarron in 2021. NBI's indicative timeframe for fibre delivery in those areas where surveying has been completed is the second half of 2021. Surveys have been completed in County Leitrim around Carrick on Shannon and further surveys are scheduled for the area of Keshcarrigan in 2022. NBI are working on firming up the fibre delivery dates for the premises already surveyed around Carrick on Shannon.</p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Sligo and Leitrim through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website . Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 13 November, 147 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Castleconnor Community Centre, Highwood Community Centre and Cartron Community Centre BCPs have all been installed by NBI in County Sligo and will be connected in the coming months. In County Leitrim, Gortlettragh Community Centre, Donaghmore Workhouse and Famine Museum and Glencar Waterfall BCPs have now been installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming months, with Aghanlish Community Centre already installed and connected.</p><p>Some 48 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 22 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Sligo, a number of schools including Calry National School, Saint Patrick&rsquo;s National School, Achonry National School, Knockminna National School, and Scoil Asicus Naofa are now connected as part of this initiative. In Leitrim, Aughawillian National School Is now connected.  My Department continues to work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. Further details can be found at .</p></reply>

In order to implement the Plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150m, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30m to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). </p>  <p>  As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p></reply>

Driving licences issued by the Member States of the European Union are mutually recognised. Therefore, a holder of an EU licence who moves to another Member State can drive on that licence until the licence expires. On expiry, the licence holder will then need to exchange their licence for the licence of the country they are now resident in.  </p>  <p>  After the transition period (transition period ends 31 December 2020), the UK will no longer be a Member State and so a UK driving licence will not be recognised here. Holders of UK licences resident in Ireland are therefore encouraged to exchange their UK licences for an Irish one before this date. </p>  <p>  However, legislation exists to allow for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes in the Road Traffic Acts.  Following the transition period, the potential then exists for arrangements to be made under those Acts and Ireland will be pursuing this option. This may take a little time to complete as it involves a formal agreement and legislation here in Ireland, as well as corresponding steps by the UK.</p>  <p>  There is a distinction between motorists with a UK driving licence visiting Ireland and those living in Ireland. Under the Convention on Road Traffic 1949 (Geneva Convention) drivers from Contracting States carrying a valid driver&rsquo;s licence can drive on each other&rsquo;s roads for up to a year. As Ireland and the UK are Contracting States to the Geneva Convention this position applies and will not change following the withdrawal date. This means that motorists who are not resident in Ireland but driving in Ireland with a UK driving licence while visiting are not affected by Brexit. </p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, tests were temporarily suspended due to the Covid 19 emergency and since resuming operations, there has been an increased level of demand.  Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity has been considerably reduced and this means that customers will experience longer waiting times for a test than was the case before the service was suspended.  The need to return to Level 5 restrictions from 22 October to 1 December 2020 for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing.  During the Level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.    </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during Level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after Level 5, and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say, my Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire 18 testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity.  However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>   The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased and scheduling additional overtime tests.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as Level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  </p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  </p>  <p>  Since the move to Level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.</p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation has eased the situation, it remains the case that there may still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. </p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.

In order to fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking must have a nominated Transport Manager to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities.  The Transport Manager must be the holder of a Certificate of Professional Competence (hereinafter referred to as &quot;TM CPC&quot;) issued in the EU, in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport depending on the nature of the operator's business. </p><p>As highlighted in the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Notice of 19 January 2018 (updated on 13 July 2020) to Stakeholders in the Field of Road Transport (), after the end of the Brexit transition period, TM CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU.  </p><p>Holders of UK-issued TM CPCs who do not intend to use their certificate to act as Transport Manager for a road transport operator based in the EU are unaffected and no action is required on their part to retain their UK certificate if working for, or seeking to work for, UK operators. </p><p>As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department has carried out a review and has identified circa 200 individuals with a UK-issued TM CPC who are nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators. My officials have recently written to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they are aware of the position as outlined in the European Commission's Brexit notice to stakeholders. The Department also carried out a similar communications exercise in October 2019 in preparation for the Brexit deadlines as they stood then, with letters issuing to relevant Transport Managers and operators at the time. </p><p>Operators affected are allowed a period of up to a maximum of six months in which to ensure that the professional competence requirement for their operator licence is once again satisfied, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 1071/2009. </p><p>Individuals who hold a UK-issued TM CPC and who wish to act as Transport Manager for a road transport operator based in the EU, including Ireland, must obtain a TM CPC issued by an EU Member State. Obtaining an Irish TM CPC requires passing the TM CPC examination administered by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT). Candidates in this case will not<b></b>be required to undertake the training course of 100 hours that is normally mandatory before taking the examination. The next TM CPC examination will be held on 9 December 2020 and online registration with CILT for this examination closed on 25 November.  The examination will next be offered in the first quarter of 2021.  </p><p>In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) 1071/2009, the Transport Manager for a road transport operator based in the EU must be resident in the EU.</p><p>My Department will continue to liaise with the European Commission on this matter; however, the current position is as set out in the relevant EU legislation as above, and Irish Transport Managers and operators must ensure that they meet the relevant EU legislative requirements.</p></reply>

Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for HTB. </p>  <p>  For a property to qualify for Help to Buy it must be new, or, converted for use as a home not having been previously been used as a home. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. First-time buyers may purchase a site containing a house which is derelict and which they plan to demolish, in whole or in part, with the intention of building a new house. First time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider them on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that in order for it to make an assessment that the dwelling being built on the site is &lsquo;new&rsquo;, sufficient evidence is required which shows that the previous dwelling was demolished and replaced as opposed to being extended/refurbished.  Revenue also require as much evidence as possible from the builder, engineer or other professionals working on the project, about the condition of the former dwelling which made it uninhabitable or unsound and required that it was demolished (and the extent of demolition involved).  If there is any other information (photos, etc.) that&rsquo;s relevant in helping Revenue understand that the property meets the criteria in the legislation, this should be included.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to broaden out the definition of a qualifying residence under the scheme in the manner mentioned by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome voluntary initiative that allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.</p>  <p>  The European Banking Authority (EBA) also introduced COVID-19 guidelines in the spring with the objective of setting out the requirements for the public and private moratoria introduced across the European Union which, if fulfilled, would help avoid the classification of exposures as forborne or defaulted under distressed restructuring.  One of the conditions for moratoria to be compliant with the EBA guidelines was that each individual payment break had to be approved before 30 September 2020, and on 21 September the EBA announced that it would not extend this deadline. I would like to clarify for the Deputy&rsquo;s information that there was no requirement or deadline by which I, as Minister for Finance, had to apply for an extension of Covid-19 payment breaks.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may nevertheless wish to note that, in its statement, the EBA indicated that banks can continue supporting their customers with extended payment moratoria after 30 September 2020, with such loans classified on a case-by-case basis according to the usual prudential framework. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19.  The Central Bank has also confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  Indeed, the Deputy may wish to note that the Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations. </p></reply>

Due to COVID19 related restrictions the decision was made once again to hold the Eurogroup meeting by videoconference. </p><p>The first agenda item featured a discussion on the latest health developments and their economic consequences, in view of the worrying surge in COVID-19 cases around Europe. Dr Andrea Ammon, Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provided a valuable and insightful briefing to the Eurogroup. </p><p>We were reminded of the value of a coordinated European response to the pandemic and we reaffirmed our commitment to continue to provide unprecedented budgetary support. We also noted that the three safety nets agreed last April are now in place.</p><p>For information, the three safety nets are:</p><p>- The SURE instrument aims to protect jobs, and I am glad to report that support has already been granted to 17 member states. We all congratulated the Commission for its successful first issuance on the financial markets in relation to this instrument.</p><p>- The European Investment Bank (EIB) Guarantee Fund supports businesses and has been in effect since the summer; the first operations worth of &euro;1 billion have already been approved by the EIB Board.</p><p>- The Pandemic Crisis Support instrument of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</p><p>The Eurogroup then moved on to a discussion on the ECB&rsquo;s report on a Digital Euro. The report looks at different ways a digital euro could be designed. Ministers see this as a priority. We all agreed that a digital euro can bring benefits to European citizens, to businesses and to the European economy as a whole. But, at the same time, we are aware that the design and implementation of a digital euro pose challenges and deserve the most careful of consideration. I am therefore glad that we were able to have our first strategic discussion on the potential economic, social and political consequences that such an innovation could entail.  I expect the Eurogroup to return to this topic on a regular basis. </p><p>We also had our first meeting in Banking Union format, this is a new grouping that is the consequence of Croatia and Bulgaria joining the Banking Union last July.  In this composition, the Chair of Banking Supervision, Andrea Enria, and the Chair of the Single Resolution Board, Elke Koenig informed us about the latest activities of their institutions, with specific attention to their response to the pandemic. We welcomed that both institutions are applying the flexibility within their regulatory framework to soften the impact of the COVID-19 on the banking sector, with a view to supporting the recovery of the economy.</p><p>The Eurogroup in inclusive format included a debriefing on the implementation of the three safety nets and we took stock of ongoing work on liquidity in resolution. </p><p>The meeting concluded with the Eurogroup issuing a statement on COVID-19 developments.

The application was submitted on the 26<sup>th</sup>of October.</p><p>That application has now been assessed and accepted by the Commission. On foot of this assessment, the Commission published a proposal for Council Implementing Decision on 16<sup>th</sup>November. Once this draft Decision is adopted by the EU Council, the Commission will include Ireland&rsquo;s loan amount in their bond issuance calendar. Draw down of the loan by Ireland is likely to happen in the first half of 2021.</p><p>The SURE instrument provides financial assistance by the European Commission to member states in the form of loans of up to &euro;100 billion in total, and takes advantage of the Commission&rsquo;s strong AAA credit rating. To date, 17 countries have applied for funding totalling &euro;87.9 billion. Ireland is the 18<sup>th</sup>country applying, for a total amount of &euro;2.474 billion. This brings the total amount committed under SURE to &euro;90.3 billion. The scheme is now live and to date the Commission has issued social bonds under the scheme to a combined value of &euro;31 billion to Poland, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia.</p><p>The amount of the Irish application is based on costs already expended by the Government as part of the Covid-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which satisfied the conditions for an application. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the TWSS was introduced on 26 March to support firm viability and preserve the relationship between the employer and employee insofar as is possible by subsidising a portion of the employer wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Nearly 70,000 employers registered for the scheme. &euro;2.7bn was spent supporting over 600,000 individual employees over the life of the scheme, which ended on 31 August 2020.</p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Bill as published provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The Bill also introduces a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties facing retailers, especially businesses in the tourism sector, I am bringing forward an amendment at committee stage to reduce the threshold to &euro;75. This reduction retains protections for the exchequer while also acknowledging the potential impact that not making this change would have on retailers across the country at this difficult time.</p></reply>

The deferral is for a period of 12 months after a business resumes trading and attracts a 0% rate of interest (during that period). The scheme also allows for an extended repayment period after the initial 12 months has passed with an interest rate of 3% rather than the 10% rate that normally applies in such circumstances.</p><p>The Debt Warehousing scheme was extended in Budget 2021 to include self-assessed income tax in respect of 2019 (balancing payment) and 2020 preliminary tax. Access to the &lsquo;warehouse&rsquo; for these liabilities, including the 0% and 3% interest rates, requires self-assessed taxpayers to have a projected reduction in income of at least 25% in 2020 compared to 2019 and to have fully paid their 2019 preliminary tax. The extended scheme also provides for the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of overpayments of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>Where &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; is not an option for self-employed taxpayers in respect of their 2019 balancing income tax payment and 2020 preliminary income tax payment, for example where they do not meet the eligibility criteria, they can still avail of a phased payment arrangement at the reduced 3% rate. Any such arrangement must be agreed with Revenue by 10 December 2020 and requires all outstanding tax returns to be filed so that the overall tax liability can be quantified and included in the phased payment agreement. Full details on the Debt Warehousing scheme are available on the Revenue website at link </p></reply>

The projections assumed that trade with the UK would take place on WTO terms from next year and that a widespread vaccine for Covid-19 would not be available before the end of 2021. It was also assumed that targeted measures would be introduced in response to any increase in the Covid-19 incidence rate; crucially, that there would not be a second national lockdown. </p>  <p>  However, in light of the rapidly deteriorating public health situation, the country moved to Level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 on October 22nd. A downside scenario analysis published in the Budget estimated that more stringent restrictions in the fourth quarter would see GDP contract by an additional percentage point this year and weaken the economic recovery next year. Although the fall-out from the latest restrictions will undoubtedly be significant, the economic impact is unlikely to be as severe as in this scenario or as that seen during the first lockdown earlier this year, as construction, education, childcare and most manufacturing activity remain open. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond this year, as long as we continue to minimise any possible &ldquo;scarring effects&rdquo; through the provision of labour market supports, I am optimistic that the Irish economy will recover relatively quickly from the crisis. Indeed, assuming a vaccination can be rolled out over the short-term, the combination of policy supports, elevated household savings and pent-up demand should provide an environment for a sustainable economic recovery. </p>  <p>  Moreover, it is possible that the pandemic may create opportunities as well as challenges. It is with this longer term perspective that the National Economic Plan, which will be published later this year, will set out the Government&rsquo;s approach to bringing Ireland out of this economic downturn. </p></reply>

The macroeconomic projections underpinning <i>Budget 2021 </i>have been developed with reference to several assessments of the macroeconomic impact of Brexit that my Department has funded and produced, including research into the inter-relationship between Covid-19 and Brexit on short-term economic prospects. </p><p>Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards: there is no good Brexit. Regardless of the outcome of the Future Partnership negotiations, the UK will be outside the Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January 2021. This will have significant and lasting implications, particularly for businesses moving goods to, from or through Great Britain. Any future trading arrangement that is different to the existing arrangement will represent a permanent shock to the Irish economy.</p><p>What we can do, and what we have been doing, is take appropriate action to mitigate these negative effects. Overall, <i>Budget 2021 </i>provides &euro;340 million for measures to prepare for Brexit through the continuation of existing measures as well as a number of new supports. This is on top of more than &euro;700 million of measures in successive Budgets since 2017. <i>Budget 2021 </i>also includes a number of enhancements to existing tax-based measures in support of sectors and enterprises likely to be most affected by Brexit.</p><p>Further,<i>Budget 2021</i>includes provision for a &euro;3.4 billion Recovery Fund, the equivalent to c. 1.7 per cent of GNI*.

Budget 2021 provides &euro;340 million for measures to prepare for Brexit, through the continuation of existing measures and new supports for sectors and enterprises likely to be most affected. This comes on top of over &euro;700 million in successive Budgets since 2017. In addition, the Recovery Fund of &euro;3.4 billion will allow specific, targeted measures to be introduced when and where the need arises in response to both Brexit and Covid-19. Budget 2021 targets an improvement in the headline fiscal position while allowing deficit-financed spending to continue in the short term to ensure that our economy and the most affected sectors and households are adequately supported.</p>  <p>  Regarding financial services, my Department is working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA to ensure the sector is adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated.</p>  <p>  Regarding preparation for the customs checks that will be necessary for goods travelling between Ireland and the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, at the end of the transition period, the Revenue Commissioners are undertaking an extensive body of work including stakeholder communications and training, staff recruitment and systems and infrastructure enhancements.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is continuing to make Ireland&rsquo;s position on the &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve known to the European Commission. The publication of a proposal from the Commission is expected in the coming days and Ireland will then begin negotiating with other Member States to ensure we receive a significant share of the Reserve to support and enhance the steps which I have outlined above.</p></reply>

Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be between 2 and 3 1/4 per cent lower, compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.</p><p>More recently, and in light of developments related to COVID-19, joint research was undertaken by my Department and the ESRI examining the impact and interrelationship of Brexit and the pandemic on the short-term economic prospects. The research found a limited overlap in the sectors exposed to the respective shocks.</p><p>Further to this, joint analysis my Department and the ESRI published in the ESRI&rsquo;s Autumn 2020 Quarterly Economic Commentary incorporated these findings to examine the impact of Brexit on the recovery path of the economy post COVID-19. The results were broadly in line with previous Department of Finance/ESRI analysis in 2019.</p><p>This research, and earlier analysis carried out and published by my Department identifying Ireland&rsquo;s trade exposure relative to our EU partners in both exports and imports terms, show that Ireland is an outlier among EU member States in terms of our trade exposure in both goods and services to the UK.</p><p>In the context of the research outlined, Budget 2021 was based on the prudent assumption of a disorderly end to the transition period between the EU and the UK at the end of this year and the projected impact of that scenario.</p><p>Under this scenario, a decline in GDP of -2 &frac12; per cent is projected for this year, and growth of 1 &frac34; per cent is expected in 2021; this is around three percentage points below a counterfactual scenario, where a trade deal between the euro area and UK is reached. </p><p>I include a list of the published research and joint research on Brexit by my Department for reference:</p><p>- Department of Finance and ESRI 2016.

As a result, the Budget 2021 projections were prudently based on a disorderly end to the transition period between the UK and the EU while it was also assumed that a widespread vaccine for COVID-19 would not be available before the end of 2021. Given these assumptions, the relationship between the two shocks is important for understanding short term economic developments. </p>  <p>  To inform the Budget 2021 economic projections my Department and the ESRI conducted an analysis of the sectoral overlap of the COVID-19 and no deal Brexit shocks. The key finding of the analysis is that there is limited overlap of the sectors exposed to the different shocks. No sector was found to be severely affected by both shocks. The analysis finds that while a dual shock from a no deal Brexit and COVID-19 increases the number of sectors at risk, the impacts of each individual shock are not exacerbated by the other shock. </p>  <p>  As the COVID-19 and Brexit are likely to affect different sectors of the economy the Budget 2021 projections effectively treated the two shocks as &lsquo;additive&rsquo;. As a result, my Department is projecting that the economy will record a modest recovery next year with GDP growth of 1&frac34; per cent in prospect reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on the economy as well as a no deal Brexit. The impact of Brexit is estimated to reduce growth by 2&frac12; to 3 percentage points next year, while over the medium term the level of GDP is expected to be approximately 3&frac12; percent lower relative to a hypothetical status quo scenario.</p>  <p>  We face these twin challenges of Brexit and Covid-19 from a position of strength. Our well educated work force and pro-enterprise culture mean that the fundamentals of our economy are strong and will facilitate a return to growth when conditions allow. Indeed, against this challenging economic background, the main focus of Budget 2021 was on meeting these twin challenges. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 includes provision for a &euro;3.4 billion Recovery Fund - equivalent to c. 1.7 per cent of GNI*.  The purpose of the Fund is to provide maximum flexibility to allow Government respond swiftly and decisively to the evolving public health and economic situation, including the fall-out from the ending of the transition period (that governs bilateral trade with the UK) at end-December. Prudent economic management in recent years has allowed us to direct an unprecedented level of resources to addressing these challenges. Careful management of the public finances is needed in order to chart our way forward through the uncertain times ahead.</p></reply>

While the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period, I can advise the Deputy that the net impact of Brexit on the policy areas within my remit is anticipated to be strongly negative. </p><p>A number of government strategies have sought to grow the international financial services sector over the last number of decades. In terms of jobs targets, the most ambitious target of a 30% increase in jobs was set out in 2015 in the five-year strategy for the sector to 2020, which was named &lsquo;IFS2020&rsquo; and which had been devised long before Brexit. </p><p>The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector will change in a number of ways as a result of the financial services investments won in recent years, including firms relocating from the UK as a result of Brexit and those looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time. </p><p>The Government and the state agencies, such as the IDA, continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland as a committed English-speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU Single Market, our continued access to EU talent and that of the Common Travel Area, in addition to our pro-business environment underpinned by a strong, fully-independent financial services regulator in the Central Bank of Ireland.  We continue to implement the latest iteration of the IFS strategies which is <i>Ireland for Finance</i>, a strategy to develop the sector to 2025. That strategy is included in the Programme for Government. The implementation is led by my colleague Minister of State Se&aacute;n Fleming TD. </p><p>The full impact of Brexit for the industry in Ireland may not materialise for some years. At present, firms are establishing the foundations of a new or significantly expanded presence in Ireland, creating a platform for future growth opportunities in all sectors: insurance, banking, and investment management. </p><p>Since the Brexit referendum in UK, we can point to the success of Barclays and Bank of America in banking plus the many investment firms who have chosen Ireland as their European base such as Legal and General, and Aberdeen Standard. Three of the largest market infrastructure players in their respective markets have made Ireland their post Brexit location for their European business, namely Refinitiv, EquiLend, and DTCC. Marine insurers The Standard Club and North P&amp;amp;I Club are both establishing operations here. Kroll/KBRA became the first ratings agency to announce that its EU HQ location would be in Dublin and this was followed by S&amp;amp;P&rsquo;s announcement in December 2017 that Dublin would become its EMEA HQ.</p><p>The IDA paused its marketing activities overseas in the second quarter of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic but a new marketing campaign commenced in the third quarter of the year as part of a phased launch across key source markets for investment.</p></reply>

Irish mortgages are also not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, and which can result in lower EU headline rates.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

On an annual basis, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has been negative since April. This phenomenon is not unique to Ireland, with many advanced economies, including the euro area, experiencing weaker inflation as a result of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  In October, headline HICP declined by -1.5 per cent on an annual basis - the lowest rate since 2010. This implies a headline inflation rate of -0.4 per cent for the year to date. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile components of energy and unprocessed food, was flat over the first ten months of the year. While low goods prices and declining air fares continue to act as a drag on inflation, declining rent prices, a key driver of overall services inflation, have put further downward pressure on both the headline and core index in recent months. Subdued price pressures are also evident in the housing market. The residential property price index declined for the third month in a row in September, with prices falling by 0.8 per cent on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  These developments are broadly in line with the outlook for inflation set out in the Budget 2021 forecasts published in October. The Department is currently forecasting headline HICP of -0.3 per cent this year and 0.4 per cent in 2021, with core inflation of 0.1 and 0.2 per cent in prospect this year and next. The headline index is expected to grow in line with the assumed recovery in oil prices next year. Services prices are also forecast to grow throughout 2021, in line with an improvement in labour market developments, putting upward pressure on both headline and core inflation.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a range of commitments to reform the insurance sector. Work has begun to implement these.  In this regard, a Cabinet Committee Sub-Group has been established by Government to oversee insurance reform implementation.  This is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes as standing members, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming.  I strongly believe this cross-departmental approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which published its Eleventh and Final Progress Update report on 30 October. </p>  <p>  By way of update, a new insurance reform Action Plan is being developed which will outline a range of deliverables, including potential legislation, where required, in a number of Government Department policy areas, and will be published before the end of the year.  Work is already underway in relation to a number of areas and it is anticipated that the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group should be able to report on progress in relation to the proposed Action Plan for insurance reform before the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this work, there has been a fresh round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform; the State Claims Agency; Insurance Ireland; Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance; the Central Bank of Ireland; and Brokers Ireland.  More recently, he has just concluded a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market, the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland, Home and Community Care Ireland, and the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key priority issue for this Government.  Minister of State Fleming and my Department will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 provides that if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must, unless it is already authorised by the Central Bank, be authorised by the Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Therefore, the range of consumer protections which applied when the loan was initially made will continue to apply following the sale of the loan.</p>  <p>  The CCMA in particular provides a strong consumer protection framework for borrowers who are in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:</p>  <p>  - Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  - Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  - Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  - Step 4: Propose a resolution</p>  <p>  When the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies, the arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the CPC apply.  Amongst other protections, that CPC requires that where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities, including banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. At my request, in 2018 the Central Bank carried out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  Based on a point in time analysis and informed by various strands of work including inspections, data collection, and stakeholder engagement, the Central Bank found that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA was working effectively and as intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated firms. When a loan is sold by a bank, any existing Alternative Repayment Arrangements (ARAs) in place with a borrower under the CCMA continue to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends and no material breaches of the CCMA by these firms were identified.  As a follow-up action to this review, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in August 2019 to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales. </p></reply>

For example, the Abhaile service which is made up of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and the Citizens Information Board provides free financial, and where appropriate also legal, advice to people experiencing difficulty in meeting their loan commitments.  </p></reply>

I outlined that I expected that staff, customers and other stakeholders would be informed promptly about any decisions being made. </p><p>News of the review is, of course, unsettling for all stakeholders, especially the staff and customers. I outlined that I expect Ulster Bank to keep all its stakeholders, especially its staff and customers, fully informed about any developments in the review and engage with them in relation to any proposals or decisions that result from the review promptly. </p><p>I also emphasised the importance of Ulster Bank to the Irish financial services market, to the wider economy and to the communities it serves. </p><p>Ulster Bank confirmed that the strategic review is ongoing and that no decision has yet been taken. Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.</p><p>The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market would be the most welcome outcome. Ulster Bank is a significant employer with 2800 employees and has 88 branches across the country. Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market. </p><p>In the absence of direct knowledge about NatWest&rsquo;s strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s operations, I cannot and will not comment or speculate on possible outcomes as there is no basis for such speculation, which would be open to misinterpretation.</p><p>While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it. My officials will continue to monitor developments.</p><p>With regard to the availability of a reliable banking systems, a recent Indecon report on Community Banking in Ireland, published by my Department in December 2019, concluded that there is extensive provision of banking services by credit unions, An Post, as well as by commercial banking providers in the Irish market. The report found that there are 1,912 branches operated by banks, credit unions and post offices in Ireland, 63% of these branches are post offices or credit unions and 37% are banks. The Indecon report also demonstrates that there is a higher number of branches per capita in many of the counties where a significant percentage of the population resides in rural areas.</p><p><b>An Post</b></p><p>- An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. </p><p>- An Post offers counter services for a number of retail banks, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.</p><p><b>Credit Unions</b></p><p>- The <b><i>Credit Union Act, 1997</i></b>(the 1997 Act) and the <b><i>Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016</i></b>set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p><p>- One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been approved to provide MPCAS.</p><p><b>Cashback</b></p><p>An alternative method for cash withdrawal is cashback. Ireland is one of only 11 EU Member States in which cashback is common practice, and retailers do not charge consumers for availing of the service.</p><p>I would welcome the introduction of new lenders to the Irish market.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

All sectors of the economy recorded declines apart from the foreign dominated multinational industry sector, which includes pharmaceutical manufacturing. This sector has proven to be resilient, growing by 16 per cent in the second quarter. However, exports from predominately domestic industries have suffered as a result of the pandemic, with the value of non-pharmaceutical exports (excluding aircraft) declining by 11 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter. Additionally, a number of services sectors suffered significant contractions. In particular, the hardest hit sub-sector of Arts and Entertainment declined by two-thirds, with the labour intensive Distribution, Transport, Hotels and Restaurants declining by a third. As the economy reopened during the summer, however, the services sector showed some signs of recovery.</p>  <p>  The recent move to Level 5 Covid-19 measures is also likely to have a disproportionate impact on the services sector while the manufacturing sector, as an &lsquo;essential&rsquo; activity, is expected to be largely unaffected. As the services sector often relies upon close physical interaction with consumers, when the current set of restrictions are relaxed these businesses are likely to reopen at reduced capacity to ensure compliance with public health guidelines. There may also be changes in consumer preferences due to concerns relating to virus transmission, resulting in lower demand for these services. Therefore, the recovery in these services sectors is likely to be gradual. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Covid-19 pandemic is unlikely to significantly impact the relative competitiveness of the Irish economy on the world stage as the global economy is experiencing the pandemic in a similar way. Indeed, the downward pressure on prices and the additional slack in the labour market as a result of the pandemic means that inflationary pressures are not likely to impact on the competitiveness of the Irish economy in the short to medium term. </p>  <p>  The extent of the recovery across the services and manufacturing sectors over the short to medium term is likely to be determined by a number of factors, including the future path of the virus, the availability of a vaccine, changing consumer preferences, as well as the future trading relationship with the UK.    </p></reply>

The Central Bank undertook a review of the continued appropriateness of the &euro;100,000 individual member&rsquo;s savings limit during 2020 which concluded that the limit remains appropriate. </p>  <p>  Separate to the limits set out by the Central Bank in the 2016 Regulations, individual credit unions may decide to set individual savings limits/caps, which are below the &euro;100,000 limit contained in the 2016 Regulations, in order to take account of their own specific business requirements and strategy. It is a commercial decision for any individual credit union to put in place any limits on the level of member savings or to decide to return some member savings where they are of the view that this will best support the ongoing prudent operation of their credit union for their members.</p></reply>

The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provided for the substantial further lessening of the impact of PSPR by way of rate and/or threshold in each of the years 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  Overall, this means that since  1 January 2020, all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum are now exempt from PSPR.  This threshold is even higher, at &euro;60,000, for those who retired between 1 March 2012 and 1 April 2019. It should be noted that pensions awarded in respect of retirements after 1 April 2019, the expiry date of the FEMPI 2013 grace period, are not subject to PSPR. </p>  <p>  These changes mean that only those pre-March 2012 pensions that are linked to salary rates of a minimum amount of &euro;108,000 per annum, or &euro;120,000 per annum in the case of the 1 March 2012 - 1 April 2019 retiree group, bear a persisting PSPR impact from 1 January 2020 on. The vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - are now entirely free from PSPR and as such, have had their pensions fully restored.</p>  <p>  Finally, section 27 of the 2017 Act states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will, no later than 31 December 2020, make an order which will specify a date for the full removal of PSPR from that residual group of PSPR-affected pensions.  </p></reply>

The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published ten-year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. The Arts Council supports and develops theatre in Ireland through grant funding, project awards, support to individual artists, and support to venues, publications and resource organisations.  Further details can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website as follow . </p><p>My Department operate a number of capital investment schemes in respect of cultural venues such as theatres. Applications under the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 are currently being accessed. This scheme focuses on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres that operate as not-for-profit organisations throughout the country and that have a clearly defined arts and culture focus. This scheme has a particular emphasis on the reduction of carbon footprints to dovetail with the Government&rsquo;s action on climate change. The Scheme builds on the success of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 which saw grants allocated to 134 organisations in 26 counties to refurbish and enhance their facilities. This funding is provided from a &euro;40m capital investment allocation for local arts and culture infrastructure contained in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Assessment and final decision on applications were delayed and put on hold as a result of COVID-19 with my Department opening Stream D, a further stream of funding under this overall scheme. This was specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening. Under Stream D, capital funding is provided to assist in the re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues as part of Project Ireland 2040. The measures are designed to support arts and culture facilities in preparation for staff, artists and audiences returning to venues to reopen in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business as well as the Return to Work Safety Protocols. There is a high degree of flexibility which will allow organisations to undertake necessary capital adaptations to their buildings so that they comply with the HSE COVID-19 related public health protection measures. Not-for-profit organisations with a clearly defined arts and cultural remit can apply for Stream D.

The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, poorly ventilated spaces.</p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including indoor sports training and exercise classes or lessons.</p>  <p>  Currently, in Level 5 sporting competition is not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. It is not currently permitted to otherwise open indoor sports facilities. Individual training indoors is permitted in Level 3 and Level 4, however indoor exercise and dance classes are not. </p>  <p>  I recognise that there is great disappointment among those who wish to engage in sport indoors during the current Level 5 restrictions which will continue until 2 December. The suite of measures to be applied thereafter, including for the sport and education sectors, will be decided by Government on the basis of the prevailing public health situation and in the context of the Framework published in September.</p></reply>

The funding will be allocated in the form of a grant scheme, open to the 69 licensed establishments in Ireland. This is aimed primarily at preventing an animal  welfare crisis as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. While the State does not ordinarily provide funding to the zoo sector, the current measures are being put in place in the context of the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect it has had on these organizations. </p>  <p>  The fund is to cover zoos&rsquo; ongoing costs during the upcoming winter period.  As well as having responsibility for licensing, inspection and regulation of zoos, my Department is responsible for ensuring compliance with welfare standards in accordance with the Irish Standards of Modern Zoo Practice, which set out best practice and strict standards for animal well-being. The grant is only to cover feed, veterinary costs, heat and lighting (in the case of reptile and tropical houses) habitat enrichment and maintenance. </p>  <p>  All licensed zoos and aquaria have been sent a copy of the grant circular, grant application form and an additional questionnaire, requesting details and evidence of these costs.  Applications for funding will be assessed by the NPWS in my Department with a view to facilitating access to funds as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  A fund of up to &euro;500,000 is to be made available to small and medium size zoos and aquaria. A distinct emergency fund of &euro;1.1m is to be made available to the two largest zoos, Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park, in order to prevent these large zoos of national strategic importance from closing.</p>  <p>  This financial support recognises the vital role played by our zoos as networks for global conservation of biodiversity, as centres of learning and places where lifelong memories of families and children are made.  This emergency funding will also safeguard employment and stimulate local economies in recovering by ensuring the continued operation of viable zoo establishments throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Applicants will hear back shortly from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p></reply>

I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  The CREL scheme will allow cost-covering rents to be set at a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>In addition to these new schemes, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.  </p><p>The broad parameters of the local authority led Affordable Purchase Scheme will be as follows:</p><p>-  aimed at first-time buyers who cannot purchase a home adequate to their needs on the open market under the macro prudential rules;</p><p>-  homes purchased under the scheme will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), with the final price of the affordable homes to be linked to the cost of provision, on a site by site basis, and</p><p>-  the local authority maintains a fully repayable equity share in the properties equivalent to the percentage discount given.</p><p>Furthermore, &euro;310m is available to local authorities for Serviced Sites infrastructure funding that will support the delivery of up to 6,200 new homes that will be made available under this scheme.  The first SSF project that will be deliver affordable homes will be Boherboy Road in Cork City in early next year.</p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under all of the above schemes will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) will play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of more affordable housing, as promised in the Programme for Government. The LDA is currently developing 9 sites that have near-term delivery potential for 3,600 new homes, the majority of which will be for Cost Rental and affordable purchase. It is also engaged in the progression of a number of other sites with potential for significant housing output.  In the longer term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which will bring essential long-term stability and sustainability to the Irish housing system.</p></reply>

Article 94 and Schedule 6 to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended) set out the information to be contained in an EIAR. Section 172(1B) of the Act requires that an EIAR furnished to the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) must be prepared by experts with the competence to ensure its completeness and quality. Article 94 further specifies that the EIAR must list the experts who contributed to the preparation of the report and identify his or her competence and experience, including relevant qualifications.

Where it is not satisfied with the quality of the EIAR, the competent authority may seek further information from the developer as it considers necessary to enable it to carry out the EIA and where such information is not provided, the application is deemed withdrawn. Furthermore, the planning authority or the Board in carrying out the EIA must consider, in addition to the EIAR itself, any submissions or observations made in relation to the environmental effects of the proposed development. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, under section 30 of the Act, as Minister, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

This work of Local Authority Fire Services, has, to a large degree, been supported by the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003 for nearly 40 years.  While this legislation has served the country well it is an appropriate time now to ensure that it fully and accurately reflects the expanded and more dynamic role that our Fire Services have taken on in recent years.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to bring forward legislation - the Fire, Emergency Management and Public Safety Bill- whose primary purpose will be to update the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003 with particular reference to changes needed arising out of the Grenfell tragedy in the UK. Furthermore, the Bill will place relevant elements of emergency management practice at national and local level on a statutory footing and  revise the legislative approach to certain aspects of public safety in Ireland with an initial focus on safety at funfairs. </p>  <p>  A General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation within my Department. I anticipate bringing a Memorandum to Government on this issue, in the near future, followed by publication of the Bill.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme has been informed by extensive consultation with the relevant sectors likely to be impacted by its provisions. All parts of the Bill have been discussed on a number of occasions at the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). The Board is made up of a representative number of Chief Executive Offices from Local authorities, the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) as well as other Government Departments. The Board has endorsed the general approach taken in the Bill.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are the sector most likely to be affected by all Parts of the Bill. For that reason special attention was paid to seeking their opinions as to the shape of this legislation should take. The views of all Chief Executive Officers, Chief Fire Offices and the relevant Directors of Service were sought via a formal written process.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Part 2 of the Bill (Fire Safety) the CFOA also contributed to the consultative process via a focus group of Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers.</p>  <p>  With respect to Part 3 of the Bill (Emergency Management) many of the provisions are based on the findings of the Review Report on the severe weather events &ldquo;Delivering Integrated Emergency Management&rdquo; brought to Government in December 2019. During the development of this Report significant engagement with key stakeholder groupings took place and informed the final recommendations in that Report. </p>  <p>  In the case of Part 4 (Public Safety) of the Bill a large number of the provisions relate to safety at funfairs. These provisions are being enacted following a comprehensive review of safety carried out by my Department. This Review included a significant degree of consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector.</p>  <p>  The Bill being advanced has been shaped and informed already by extensive engagement with relevant stakeholders. However, as with any legislative process my Department remains open to receiving  and considering all views on the subject matters covered by the Bill.   </p></reply>

The Act provides a legal basis for the various policies and procedures that are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate or naturalisation certificate. However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage, civil partnership etc. where civil, or legal documents are available to verify this change</p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises, other than by marriage or civil partnership etc, the Act requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two year period. In very sensitive cases there is discretion under the Act for accepting evidence of usage for less than two years.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, if a person requests issuance of a passport with a name change consisting of the use of the Irish version of his/her name, the Passport Service may adopt some flexibility in this policy and may facilitate the request if the applicant provides proof of a minimum period of six months usage of the Irish version of their name. In such cases, the Passport Service will include an observation on the passport recording the person&rsquo;s birth certificate or previous name. This observation must remain on the passport until the condition of two years proof of usage can be satisfied. After the required two years and if the person wishes to do so, he/she may reapply (full fee will be required), submitting the required two years proof, and a new passport may issue without the observation.</p>  <p>  These rules seek to protect the integrity and security of the Irish passports against passport and identity fraud while allowing for genuine cases where name changes have occurred. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of security features within the book and the robust processes involved in its issuance.</p></reply>

Medmark, the current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance.</p>  <p>  A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the employee to Medmark, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.   The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  An employee is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, higher risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  </p>  <p>  Under the current HSE guidelines, a pregnant employee is not deemed to be at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, unless suffering from a serious heart condition. A teacher who is well must therefore attend the workplace.  The school has a responsibility as the employer to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full.  </p>  <p>  If this, or any other relevant medical matter, is reviewed and updated by the HSE, Medmark will be informed as the occupational health service provider, by the HSE, and will adjust their decision making processes accordingly.  </p>  <p>  Where an employee considers the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, a review can be requested by the employee where Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The employee may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. </p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year there are 887 schools in the DEIS Programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. My Department will spend in the region of &euro;125 million in 2020 on the DEIS Programme.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2021 I announced a general reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule to 25:1, which will also apply to DEIS Rural and Urban Band 2 schools.  While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only. Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1.  The reason for this is due to the fact that the differential has narrowed further following the announcement of an overall reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule to 25:1. </p>  <p>  The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5 million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.  My Department continues to support those schools most in need and I am considering options on how best to achieve this. </p></reply>

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. Cleaning is an important aspect of infection prevention control measures in schools to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  However, I wish to clarify to the Deputy that cleaners in primary and post-primary schools are not contracted to or paid by the Department of Education.  Cleaners are employed by these schools directly, using the ancillary grant to schools, which allows them the flexibility of hiring cleaner/s in the most locally useful manner.  The provision of a pension is therefore a matter for the respective, individual schools.  Schools as employers are obliged to provide access to a PRSA.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that, in line with the &lsquo;Roadmap for Pension Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023&rsquo;, the Government has committed to develop and implement a State-sponsored &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; supplementary retirement savings system by 2022.  Under Automatic Enrolment, employees without personal retirement savings and who meet certain age and earnings criteria will be automatically enrolled into a State-sponsored quality assured supplementary retirement savings system, with freedom of choice to opt-out. </p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p><p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p><p>1.  enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p><p>2.  additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.  </p><p>3.  utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process.</p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>Under project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in County Kildare may be viewed on my Department's website, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need, has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website and this information is also updated regularly. </p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue) allocated the husband&rsquo;s Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number to the wife and appended a &ldquo;W&rdquo; to the end so that they could be separately identified but linked for joint assessment.  </p>  <p>  The Finance Act 1993 provided that either spouse could be the assessable spouse, and the practice of allocating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers ceased. From then on, all persons were allocated individual, unique numbers.  However, it was decided, at that stage, not to ask all individuals with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them until there was an actual need to do so. </p>  <p>  The Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1998, replacing the RSI Number, and my Department was given legislative responsibility for allocating and managing these new numbers.  In practice the RSI numbers in existence were retained and became PPS Numbers, including &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers.  In other words, Level W numbers are PPS Numbers in their own right and it is not the case that any person shares a PPS Number with another person.</p>  <p>  It is the case that Revenue request people with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them once they need to engage with them on taxation matters. The process of replacing a &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number is relatively straightforward and there is no need for the person to attend any office or to queue for service.  As part of the process, my Department verifies the identity of the individual, secures their consent, purges the existing number and replaces it with either a new number or one that the individual may have had prior to marriage.  In addition, all pre-existing records relating to that individual are transferred over to the new number. </p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021, bringing its budget to &euro;5.8 million for the year, to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid-2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project. In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.  It is not possible to indicate a precise date for the publication of the Bill at this point but I am conscious of its importance.</p>  <p>  With reference to the recommendations of the Report of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, the commencement of Part 8 &ndash; Advanced Healthcare Directives is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I am launching a Review of the SUSI scheme.  This review will focus on:</p>  <p>  - Assessing the impact of Covid on the SUSI scheme.</p>  <p>  - Review of eligibility and adjacency rates.</p>  <p>  - Examining the future role of SUSI in supporting different forms of provision in line with national priorities, including postgraduate studies and part-time provision.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020, and will report in Summer 2021.  Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process, and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students can apply for supports under the Student Assistance Fund. The fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The Scheme operates in the context of competing educational priorities and limited public funding.</p>  <p>  To avail of the graduate entry route for medicine, a primary degree in another discipline is necessary. Accordingly such students are ineligible for grant assistance on the basis that they already hold an undergraduate degree.</p>  <p>  However, institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme. Details of these services and supports are available from the relevant institution.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

As such I'm sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment further on this matter. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact legislation in this area, and I am supporting the progression of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill. The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 1 December 2020.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I secured Cabinet approval to bring forward amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill to provide for two new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </p>  <p>  The first offence will deal with the taking, distribution, publication or threat to distribute intimate images without consent, and with intent to cause harm to the victim. It is intended to carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The second offence will deal with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim. It is intended that this offence will carry a maximum penalty of a &euro;5,000 fine and/or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The amendments proposed also provide that it will be irrelevant that a person may have consented to the taking of an image if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent. It will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.</p>  <p>  Further amendments approved by Cabinet will update harassment legislation to broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover all forms of persistent communications about a person, not just indecent images, and to increase the penalty from seven to ten years' imprisonment to reflect the harm that can be caused by most serious forms of harassment. </p>  <p>  Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society. I am, along with my Government colleagues, fully committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives are underway to address this. </p>  <p>  Producing or distributing child sexual abuse material are already criminal offences under existing Irish legislation. In addition, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 brought in a new offence of accessing child sexual abuse material online. It also criminalised grooming behaviour, such as communicating with a child online for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s national service for the reporting of suspected online illegal content is Hotline.ie.  On receipt of reports, Hotline.ie&rsquo;s Content Analysts examine the content and, if the material is considered illegal, will issue notice and takedown request orders to the appropriate service provider and will notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the relevant information. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Garda National Protective Service Bureau are keeping peer-to-peer activity (this relates to file sharing of illegal material over private networks) under close review including through their use of FBI-developed Round-Up software tool.</p>  <p>  Progression of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill is a priority action for me as Minister for Justice and I am committed to seeing it enacted as quickly as possible. I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Deputy Brendan Howlin in advancing the proposed amendments and I very much welcome the support expressed by all for this legislation. </p></reply>

This is an important Programme for Government commitment and is something I have identified as a priority action for my Department.  Furthermore, the Government has supported this commitment with funding in our first Budget to make sure this priority is delivered in 2021.</p>  <p>  The new statutory Parole Board will considerably improve the system as it currently operates.</p>  <p>  The Parole Act 2019 puts the Parole Board on an independent statutory footing and sets out clear and transparent criteria for how the Board will reach its decisions, which will be independent of the Minister of the day.  This includes what factors will be taken into account in making those decisions, who may make submissions - which includes the victim&rsquo;s right to make a formal submission to the Board - as well as a number of other details. </p>  <p>  The Act also increases the length of the sentence which must be served by life sentenced prisoners before they are eligible to be considered for parole. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may appreciate, the move from the current model to the model set out in the 2019 Act is complex and a significant amount of planning has been required to allow for its establishment. For example, substantial preparatory work is needed to analyse and document the new legal processes that will give effect to the provisions of the Act. The Deputy will appreciate this is essential to reduce the risk of successful legal challenge by those affected. </p>  <p>  There are also a number of practical steps required before commencing the Act and establishing the Parole Board. </p>  <p>  I have established a Project Board in my Department to drive forward and carry out this important work and ensure that all necessary arrangements are made as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a significantly increased funding allocation of &euro;1.3m to allow the Project Board to take forward their work, and move us from planning to the implementation phase of the 2019 Act.  To further support this work, additional staff have been assigned to implement this project on a priority basis, in addition to the seven existing Parole Board staff who will continue to support the existing Board. </p>  <p>  A critical path for delivery of this significant priority project is currently being developed, with a view to ensuring full commencement of the Parole Act, which will be achieved in 2021.</p></reply>

This is a Constitutional function that cannot be transferred or delegated.  The Constitutional prerogative on advising the President on judicial appointments lies with the Government alone.</p>  <p>  Eligible serving Judges who wish to express an interest in elevation to positions in the superior courts are not currently required to apply to Judicial Advisory Appointments Board (JAAB).  Instead, there is a process whereby expressions of interest may be submitted to the Minister of the day via the office of the Attorney General.  Such expressions of interest are received on an ongoing basis and retained for any current or future vacancy that might arise.  </p>  <p>  Whether or not existing judges put forward expressions of interest is a confidential matter for obvious reasons, and it is not the practice to release information that might identify any of those judges.  However, I am conscious of recent speculation that three such expressions of interest were received.  I have not contributed to this speculation at any time and while I cannot disclose any personal details, I wish to be clear that there were in fact five expressions of interest on file dating from 2017 up until June 2020.  All of these were submitted to me and I actively considered all of them. </p>  <p>  Having considered the response from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board: expressions of interest from serving members of the judiciary and all other judges eligible for the position, I made a decision, completed the necessary consultations in line with the Cabinet Handbook and proposed a name to Cabinet.  All the requirements of the process, as set out in law, were fully met.</p></reply>

I, as Minister, have no role in the operational matters pertaining to the Ombudsman Commission's remit, such as the direction of investigative priorities.</p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy will also be aware that the management and administration of the Garda organisation is a function of the Garda Commissioner under Section 26 of the 2005 Act.Again, as Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p><p>I have been advised by GSOC, however, that if GSOC believes there is a suspected criminal offence in the circumstances surrounding the death of an individual in Garda custody, then the subsequent GSOC investigation is a criminal one with GSOC Designated Officers having all the powers, privileges and immunities as those that apply to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>If the matter does not appear to involve a criminal offence, then the GSOC investigation of the death-in-custody is a non-criminal one, which may include the consideration of any disciplinary matters that may be present.  GSOC will ultimately report to the relevant Coroner on the circumstances of the death-in-custody so that an inquest may be held.  To this end, GSOC will adopt a very similar approach to that taken by Garda&iacute; in their investigations into deaths in that context.</p><p>I am further advised that  each such investigation is complex and prescribing a time frame of such investigations is not possible.  I am advised, however, that GSOC commences such investigations expeditiously upon notification from the Commissioner of any incident under Section 102 of the 2005 Act.  In the past , GSOC has also opened investigations in the public interest under Section 102(4) of the Act, in the absence of any complaint or referral from the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>The criteria for referral of such matters to GSOC are provided for under Section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Section 102(1) provides that &quot;<i>The Garda Commissioner shall refer to the Ombudsman Commission any matter that appears to the Commissioner to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person</i>&quot;. </p><p>It is important to note that this statutory obligation covers any incident involving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that may have resulted in the death or serious harm of a person, and is not limited solely to deaths in custody or after a period of detention.</p><p>In relation to the number of investigations carried out by GSOC relating to deaths in custody or after a period of detention,  the question is understood here to mean 'deaths-in-custody in a Garda Station' or 'deaths after release from a period of custody in a Garda Station'.</p><p>GSOC have advised that the following number of such investigations have been undertaken in the years specified:</p><p>2016 - 2</p><p>2017 - 2</p><p>2018 - 2</p><p>2019 - 5</p><p>2020 (Year to date) - 1 </p></reply>

Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There are also legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.  However, I am very much aware that parental alienation is a complex issue and that further analysis may be desirable.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published a report last year on Reform of the Family Law System which includes parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  My department has recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group which will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. As part of its work, the oversight group will consider the various recommendations, including the recommendation on parent alienation, contained in the Report of the Joint Committee. </p>  <p>  The oversight group includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as officials from my Department.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. In the preparation of the General Scheme of that Bill, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System.  </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill will be a key element of the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system. </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: </p><p>1.  be approved  by the local Joint Policing Committee,  </p><p>2.  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and  </p><p>3.  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.

However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; over the last eight months as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>For the Deputy's information the table below, as provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of Community Garda&iacute; by rank, assigned to Community Policing duties, in the DMR North for the years 2015 up to and including 31 October 2020. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>DMR North </b></th>       <th><b>Garda </b></th>       <th><b>Sergeant </b></th>       <th><b>Total</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31-Oct-20</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that some members attached to Community Policing Units in DMR  North were temporarily re-assigned to the regular units at the commencement of the COVID-19 roster. However, members from the Community Policing Units remain in contact with their contacts throughout the community and have been providing valuable assistance to vulnerable persons throughout the crisis.  </p></reply>

Further, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe that a convicted offender poses a serious risk to the public, an application can be made to the courts for a Sex Offender Order under section 16 of the 2001 Act.  Such an Order can prohibit the offender from doing anything the Court considers necessary, in order to ensure that the public is protected from serious harm.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which was developed by my Department following a comprehensive review of current law and administrative practice, the General Scheme was approved by Government in June 2018 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Bill is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. My officials and that Office are working proactively together with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.  </p>  <p>  While the drafting process is not yet complete, I expect the main provisions to include:</p>  <p>-  Stricter notification requirements including requiring offenders to notify Garda&iacute; of their address upon release from custody, or any subsequent change of address, within 3 days as opposed to the existing 7 days. </p>  <p>-  Provision to allow for fingerprinting and photographing  the offender, where necessary to confirm their identity.</p>  <p>-  Enhanced supervision of high-risk offenders, including, in limited circumstances, the electronic monitoring of offenders subject to post-release supervision orders.</p>  <p>-  The placing on a legislative footing of assessment teams to assess and manage the risk posed by sex offenders.</p>  <p>-  Provisions whereby a court can prohibit a sex offender from working with children.</p>  <p>-  Provision for a statutory basis for the necessary disclosure of information relating to a high-risk offender. This information may include the name, address and threat posed by the offender. </p>  <p>  There is a need for caution in relation to disclosure measures. Wide or indiscriminate disclosure of information such as the name and location of sex offenders may lead to offenders withdrawing from engagement with post-release services and fleeing to unknown locations because of fears for their safety. This is in no-one&rsquo;s interest &ndash; it is important that offenders in these very serious crimes are properly supervised after release and encouraged to engage with rehabilitative services in order to prevent reoffending behaviour. However, in limited circumstances this disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of the public or a member of the public. The Bill provides that the disclosure will be limited to the minimum number of people necessary to avert a serious risk.</p></reply>

Its functions are set out in section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended.   </p>  <p>  Section 18 of the 1995 Act makes specific provision that the Board may recommend the Attorney General for appointment to judicial office. Where the Attorney General wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office, he or she shall withdraw from any deliberations of the Board concerning his or her suitability for judicial office.  This is the law. </p>  <p>  As outlined to the House earlier today, I can confirm that the Chief Justice wrote to my predecessor on 4 February 2020 requesting that the Supreme Court vacancy arising from the retirement of Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan in June 2019 be filled.  He cited emerging pressures including the establishment of the Cervical Check Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The then Minister wrote to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) on 17 February 2020.  He asked the Board to furnish him with nominations for this vacancy, and the name of each person who had informed the Board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment. </p>  <p>  The Minister also wrote separately to the Chief Justice stating that this request of the JAAB did not pre-suppose the filling of the post; it was to facilitate the procedure should a decision be taken to make an appointment at whatever point in the future that vacancy might be progressed.   </p>  <p>  By letter to my predecessor dated 11 March, 2020, the JAAB advised that they had met on 9 March and decided to recommend one candidate, Mr S&eacute;amus Woulfe, SC, whom it considered suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court.  As requested by the Minister, and as required by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the JAAB indicated that there was one applicant considered for this post through the JAAB process, Seamus Woulfe, SC, and that there were no other applicants.</p>  <p>  Under Section 20 of the 1995 Act, all proceedings of the Board and all communications to the Board are confidential, so that is all of the information made available to me by the independent Board.   </p></reply>

This reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to  developing all aspects of mental health care nationally.</p>  <p>  Jigsaw currently has 12 sites nationwide, all of which provide appropriate intervention and supports for young people age 12 to 25, with mild to moderate mental health difficulties. Two new sites are scheduled to open in Wicklow and Tipperary in the near future.</p>  <p>  I have engaged intensively at local level since my appointment to help develop various mental health services in Tipperary. In particular, I have liaised with local stakeholders, and with Jigsaw and the HSE, to progress the new Jigsaw service for the county.</p>  <p>  Jigsaw has been, and remains, fully committed to open its new service for Tipperary as soon as possible. The challenge of locating a suitable premises has been significant, and has also been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, along with associated restrictions for a substantial proportion of this year. The focus for Jigsaw over recent times has been to secure a suitable and permanent premises in Thurles.  This process is key to informing and firming up evolving timelines for this important project. The process for securing the new premises is near completion.</p>  <p>  Jigsaw, in its search for a suitable building, operates against a clear set of criteria (including value for public money), and in line with all HSE and other procurement guidelines. The various options it has explored in Thurles have been assessed against such criteria. Other criteria were also considered in the selection process, including accessibility and parking.</p>  <p>  I understand that Jigsaw recently advertised for staff for the new service. Jigsaw will have to undertake necessary minor adaptation works in its new premises. Staffing may include, for example, a Service Manager, Clinical Lead and relevant counselling or other health professionals, depending on the Skill-Mix requirements at local level. The new service will be based in Thurles, thus facilitating development of out-reach services in Clonmel and Nenagh, together with the use of new technologies to facilitate the widest possible service provision.</p>  <p>  Jigsaw look forward to bringing this new service as soon as possible to the young people and the wider community in Tipperary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may rest assured that I will continue to liaise with Jigsaw and the HSE to progress this project, and that I will keep relevant local public representatives informed of developments.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time. All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Primary infection with varicella results in varicella (chickenpox). Recurrent infection results in herpes zoster (shingles).</p>  <p>  NIAC has identified the evaluation of VZV as a key priority for 2020. My Department has written to HIQA to request that it considers undertaking a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) relating to VZV vaccine in children in 2020 to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  The HIQA recently advised that COVID-19 has impacted its work plan and anticipates that it will conduct the HTA prioritisation process in Q1 2021 and the request for a HTA of varicella zoster vaccine in children will be included in that exercise.</p>  <p>  The allocation of funding for Healthy Ireland initiatives does not include provision for the childhood immunisation programme.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. </p>  <p>   On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p>  <p>  At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p>  <p>  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. The latest public health advice on these matters is available at the links below and is updated on a regular basis:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-health/.</p>  <p>  www2.hse.ie/coronavirus/.</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/.</p></reply>

My Department actively investigates incidents of illegal burning using satellite imagery.</p>  <p>  The person named submitted his 2020 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application on 6 May 2020 in which he declared the lands he was farming.

The person named has been given the right to a review of his position and to submit any documentary evidence that he may have regarding the burning of this parcel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the reduction of this parcel does not impact on their BPS payment as he has sufficient land to allow payment on the entitlements held by him.  However, the reduction in land may impact on any other land-based schemes that the person named has applied for such as GLAS.</p>  <p>  The associated GLAS application is currently undergoing pre-payment validation checks for the 2020 advance (85%) payment, including a cross check of land parcels claimed for GLAS against BPS records. The GLAS commonage payment is calculated based on the lesser of the claimed area or eligible area (MEA) as determined by BPS. </p>  <p>  When the 2020 advance payment is processed, if an overclaim arises in relation to commonage which results in a GLAS penalty, the applicant will be informed in writing and be given the option of appeal. </p></reply>

It was also reflected in the Programme for Government commitment to <i>'work at EU level for the development of a PGI for Irish beef'</i>.</p><p>The time taken to finalise an application can depend on a number of factors, including the level of detail provided by the applicant in the initial draft, the nature of the product and the time required for scrutiny of the dossier, including the Single Document and the Specification Document, to ensure compliance with the EU requirements.</p><p>The result of the work undertaken since early 2019 is reflected in the documents published by my Department on 14 August 2020 under the National Opposition Procedure provided for in the PGI governing EU rules.</p></reply>

In the course of examination of the Specification and Single Documents that form the application for registration of a product name, officials of my Department advise applicants on the rules that must be adhered to as provided in the EU Regulation and guidelines. It is open to applicants to act on that advice. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that any GI applications submitted to the EU Commission must be accompanied by a declaration by the Member State Competent Authority that it considers that the application lodged by the applicant meets the conditions of the Regulations and its provisions. Every effort is made by my Department to ensure that applications sent to the EU conform with the requirements. Applications sent are subject to EU scrutiny.   </p>  <p>  Under the EU quality schemes, achieving Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) recognition for products enables consumers to trust and distinguish quality products while also helping producers to market their products better.  It is important therefore that the information provided to the EU Commission at time of application is as complete and correct as possible.</p></reply>

The first of these strategies was published in 2000. All of the strategies have had a ten-year horizon, revisited every five years:</p><p>-  Agri Food 2010 was published in 2000</p><p>-  Agri Vision 2015 was published in 2005</p><p>-  Food Harvest 2020 was published in 2010</p><p>-  Food Wise 2025 was published in 2015.</p><p>Food Wise 2025 is the current 10 year strategy for the Irish agri-food sector. Agreed by stakeholders and adopted by the Government, it underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and illustrates the potential for further development.  The targets and actions in the Food Wise Report are monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee, chaired by myself, meets regularly to review and  monitor these actions and ongoing developments in the sector. </p><p>Preparations are underway for the next strategy for the agri-food sector to 2030.  A public consultation was launched in July 2019 to ascertain the views on the direction of the sector to 2030 and a national stakeholder consultation event was held in October 2019.  A stakeholder committee was established in November 2019, tasked with incorporating the outcomes of these consultations in developing the next agri-food strategy to 2030.  </p><p>The Committee's terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. While there has been some delay in the process arising from the pandemic, the Committee are scheduled to finish their deliberations shortly. </p></reply>
