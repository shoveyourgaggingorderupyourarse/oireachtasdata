We continue to engage on the Afghanistan crisis at international level. </p>  <p>  As the President of the UN Security Council for the month of September, Ireland chaired a meeting on Afghanistan on 9 September. In our national statement, I placed a strong emphasis on full and safe humanitarian access and on the importance of human rights, including the rights of Afghan women, girls and minorities. </p>  <p>  Ireland engaged extensively on the extension of the mandate for the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) that was agreed on 17 September, to facilitate continued UN operations in Afghanistan - including coordinating humanitarian relief. </p>  <p>  At EU level, Foreign Ministers have agreed Council Conclusions that set out five key benchmarks to inform the EU&rsquo;s engagement with any future Afghan Government.</p>  <p>  There has also been close international cooperation and coordination on evacuation efforts.  A total of 58 Irish citizens and dependents have safely evacuated from Afghanistan since mid-August, including with the support of the Emergency Civil Assistance Team which I approved. My Department continues to liaise with partners, including those with a presence on the ground, to explore and utilise safe options for the exit of Irish citizens and Afghans who are resident in Ireland &ndash; so that they can return home. </p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 370 at-risk Afghan citizens have been offered refugee status in Ireland under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme &ndash; as managed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth. Approximately 150 participants in this Programme have reached Ireland to date or are expected to arrive shortly. The Department of Justice is also working to facilitate family reunification visas.</p>  <p>  Addressing the worsening humanitarian situation remains a priority for Ireland. My Department has provided &euro;1m to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for urgent support in and around Afghanistan. We have also this week approved an additional &euro;2m, half of which will go to UNICEF and half to the UNOCHA Afghanistan Humanitarian fund. This follows over &euro;2 million in humanitarian funding we had already provided this year, bringing Ireland's total donation to &euro;5 million for 2021. We have also contributed to the response through joint UN and EU mechanisms.</p></reply>

Under the new programme, current or former Afghan nationals resident in Ireland can apply for close family members in Afghanistan, or who have recently fled Afghanistan to certain countries, to be granted temporary residence in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I very much welcome this new proposal from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, which will create a tailored reunification programme and enable Ireland to better respond to the situation in Afghanistan. Up to 500 places will be available under this programme.</p>  <p>  The current possibilities for Afghan nationals to be granted permission to enter Ireland will continue in parallel to the new programme. Places have been allocated under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme to approximately 370 Afghan nationals, some 150 of whom have travelled to Ireland. Priority was given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations.  The operation of this programme is managed by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs is, through our diplomatic network liaising with relevant authorities in the region and countries in Europe in relation to transit routes. The Department of Justice is providing practical support by way of issuing visas, or visa waivers, to facilitate travel to Ireland. That Department is also focused on processing applications for Afghan family members of Irish citizens and Afghan nationals living in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I understand the Department of Justice is currently reviewing all international protection applications from Afghan nationals with a view to expediting their progress, in line with updated advice provided by UNHCR in recent weeks. These applications are already prioritised, as agreed with UNHCR. The processing of these applications takes full account of whether a person will be in danger if not provided with a permission to remain here.</p></reply>

We have engaged actively in monthly meetings on the situation. I addressed meetings of the Council on this issue in January and May. </p>  <p>  Throughout our Security Council tenure, my officials have consistently engaged with representatives of the parties to the conflict, and with key interlocutors, including with the United States. </p>  <p>  In May, as the situation worsened and hostilities escalated, Ireland worked to ensure the Council engaged on the matter, including co-sponsoring a Tunisian request for consultations on the issue at the Council. Ireland actively participated in negotiations for  a draft Resolution to demand a cessation of hostilities. While that effort was not successful, it is indicative of our sustained efforts on the issue. We supported the Council Presidency Statement welcoming the ceasefire which was subsequently agreed. </p>  <p>  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council this month, I chaired a dialogue between the Security Council and the League of Arab States on 22 September, during which I underlined the need for strong regional engagement on the Middle East Peace Process and a reinvigoration of the political track. </p>  <p>  I had  discussions on the situation in my bilateral meetings at the UN, including with the Egyptian Foreign Minister. On 29 September, Ireland chaired the Council&rsquo;s monthly meeting on the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question. This meeting focused on implementation of Security Council Resolution 2334, which includes the issue of illegal settlements, violence against civilians and de-escalation and reversal of negative trends. </p>  <p>  As part of our commitment to the Council hearing directly from those affected by its decisions, Ireland invited two women civil society speakers, one Israeli and one Palestinian, to address yesterday&rsquo;s meeting. Their perspectives were particularly valuable. </p>  <p>  I have been clear with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of our commitment to advancing a two-State solution for a resolution of the conflict based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.</p></reply>

In recent weeks, the White House announced that these restrictions will be lifted, for those who are fully vaccinated, in early November. I very much welcome this announcement and I know this will come as good news for many in Ireland, Irish citizens living in the United States, as well as our American friends with links to Ireland and the rest of Europe. </p>  <p>  Although entry into the United States, including pre-clearance, is a matter solely for US authorities, ensuring that travel between Ireland and the US can resume in a safe way is a priority for this Government. The Government has consistently raised the matter with the US authorities at the highest levels, both here in Dublin and through our Embassy in Washington D.C. We have also worked with our partners in the EU to address the issue. </p>  <p>  In August this year, the Taoiseach wrote directly to President Biden noting the disruptive impact that US travel restrictions have had, and sharing information about Ireland&rsquo;s successful and ongoing vaccination programme. </p>  <p>  I myself had meetings with US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, in May this year, during which we discussed the importance of strengthening the transatlantic relationship; ease of travel is of course vital to this. Officials at our Embassy in Washington D.C., including Ambassador Mulhall, have actively sought opportunities where they have been able to raise the issue with the US Administration and Department of State. </p>  <p>  In terms of efforts through the EU, together with other member states, we wrote to US Secretary of State Blinken in June requesting reconsideration of travel restrictions. A joint EU-US Experts&rsquo; Working Group was also set up between the EU and the US to work towards the safe resumption of travel. </p>  <p>  Strong connectivity between our two countries is absolutely vital for strengthening connections across the Atlantic. I look forward to November and a swift resumption of safe travel between Ireland and the US.</p></reply>

At present, there are just over 31,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration system.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic, Passport Service staff were reassigned to the HSE for essential contact tracing; to the Department of Social Protection for the processing of essential PUP payments, and to support the Department of Health with quarantine issues. This resulted in a pause in overall FBR processing while Passport Service staff continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency. Over 4,500 of such emergency FBR applications have been processed in 2021. The FBR Service continues to consider urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis, in cases such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. </p>  <p>  In cases of exceptional urgency FBR applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly by telephone or webchat on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.dfa.ie).</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is very concerned about the number of FBR applications currently on hand and is actively planning to resume processing FBR applications as soon as possible. My Department is committed to allocating further resources to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021.  In the medium term, changes to the FBR process to increase efficiencies and improve the customer experience will be delivered under the next phase of my Department's Passport Reform Programme.</p></reply>

The visit provided opportunities to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral cooperation with both countries, along with our engagement on peace and security in the Horn of Africa more broadly.  During the visit, I had extensive discussions on the situation in Tigray with President Kenyatta of Kenya, and with the UN Ambassadors of Kenya, Niger and Tunisia, the three African countries currently serving on the Security Council alongside Ireland.  I followed up on these discussions with a meeting with Ethiopia's deputy Prime Minister, Demeke Mekonnen, in New York on 21 September.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to take the lead at the UN Security Council on the situation in Tigray, most recently spearheading calls for the open Council meeting of 26 August, where we urged an end to the violence, full humanitarian access, accountability for atrocities, and for a political solution to the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority is the welfare of the people of Ethiopia, which is affected by the persistence of conflict. Through the Irish Aid programme, we have so far provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and to the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground. On 7 July, Minister Brophy announced additional humanitarian funding of &euro;2.75m for Ethiopia, to address hunger and insecurity, including in Tigray.</p></reply>

On 9 September, I chaired a Council meeting on Afghanistan which took place in advance of the Council&rsquo;s extension of the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission. I stressed that those in power in Kabul must adhere to Afghanistan&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian, refugee and human rights law, and that women and girls must be treated as equal citizens.  </p>  <p>  In Security Council meetings this month on Yemen, Libya and South Sudan, Ireland emphasised the need for human rights to be fully respected. In the Council's recent meeting on Sudan, Ireland focused on the need to ensure the full, equal, and meaningful participation on women in new democratic institutions. As co-penholder with Norway of the Syria humanitarian file, Ireland renewed calls for unhindered humanitarian access, while condemning recent attacks on hospitals and schools.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that the Security Council hears the voices of those affected by its decisions, and we have sought to ensure the participation of civil society speakers in Council meetings during our Presidency with a particular focus on women peacebuilders.

It allows a predetermined number of vulnerable people in need of international protection to be granted refugee status in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Approximately 370 places have been allocated to Afghan nationals under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and some 150 of those have arrived in Ireland.  Priority was given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations.  My colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth considers requests for refugee status.  My officials transmit requests received to his Department for consideration.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs is in touch with and providing consular assistance to this group, and since mid-August 58 Irish citizens and their dependents have safely exited from the country. Our support has included the short-term deployment of an Emergency Civil Assistance Team (ECAT), which enabled 26 Irish citizens and residents to evacuate safely on 24-26 August. </p>  <p>  Efforts are ongoing to secure the safe exit of the remaining citizens and their dependents who wish to leave Afghanistan. Our Embassy network is playing a critical role in this, including working with partners in the region on transit routes. My Department also continues to liaise with the European External Action Service and EU Member States on information sharing and the management of repatriations.</p>  <p>  The situation is complex and our priority remains ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our citizens. We will continue to provide consular support to those remaining in Afghanistan via our Embassy in Abu Dhabi. </p>  <p>  In addition to providing assistance for Irish citizens and their dependents, Ireland is also supporting Afghans who are resident here to return to Ireland, as well as those qualifying for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  Vital to our work is the fulfilment of the Taliban commitment to allow the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and Afghans at-risk who wish to leave the country &ndash; in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2593. </p>  <p>  The Council of the European Union has also made it clear that this is one of the key benchmarks for any future engagement with the Taliban-appointed caretaker cabinet in Afghanistan. </p>  <p>  I know that there are many with deep concerns for family members, friends and colleagues who remain in Afghanistan. I can give full assurance that the Government remains strongly committed to doing whatever possible to ensure that people are able to depart safely, and return to Ireland, if they wish to do so.</p></reply>

It is important that we do so in a responsible way. Ireland's development programme has a strong global reputation. This reputation was confirmed in the Peer Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Development Assistance, issued by the OECD earlier this year. Our ambition to meet this important target must not see ODA quantity come at the cost of its quality.</p>  <p>  Our ODA allocation has increased in real terms for the last seven consecutive years. The recent strong recovery in GNI means that to achieve modest increases as a proportion of GNI, ODA will need to continue to increase in real terms. My Department is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable way. This also includes working in coordination with other Government Departments and bodies spending Official Development Assistance, and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on allocations to ODA.</p></reply>

It is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s membership, and we are currently providing leadership on the Council as co-chair of the Informal Expert Group (IEG) on Climate and Security together with Niger.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Open Debate was to deepen substantive awareness of how climate is relevant to the work of the Security Council, and the impacts of climate change on situations of conflict, and to outline what actions the Council can take within its mandate to anticipate, advance and shape action on climate-related security risks. UN Secretary-General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres and a civil society activist provided important briefings to the Council on these issues. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach noted that, where climate change is a factor in exacerbating instability and undermining peace and security, the Security Council should use the tools at its disposal to tackle the related issues. He urged the Council to act, and noted Ireland&rsquo;s intention to convene discussions on a thematic resolution on climate and security. </p>  <p>  Council members broadly welcomed Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to advance this agenda, with most supporting the tabling of a thematic resolution. A small number noted their view that Climate change should be dealt with in broader development-related organs, fora and processes outside of the Security Council.</p>  <p>  Following on from the Open Debate, Ireland and Niger intend to convene further discussions with all Council members, with a view to being able to adopt a thematic resolution. This would be an important first for the Security Council and would allow it to better assess and address the effects of climate change in its work.</p>  <p>  During our Presidency of the Council throughout the month of September 2021, Ireland chaired meetings across a broad range of issues on the Council agenda. I chaired a debate on Afghanistan on 9 September, during which the Council unanimously approved a Resolution on peacekeeping brought forward by Ireland. Minister of State Byrne also chaired a Briefing on the 25th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on 27 September.</p></reply>

Progress on its implementation is crucial, for families and victims and for society as a whole. It was agreed in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented.</p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July for a &lsquo;Statute of Limitations&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, have caused significant upset, shock and concern. They represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement and we cannot accept them.</p>  <p>  Where the British Government propose significant changes to the Stormont House framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly and in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society. </p>  <p>  Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward, with discussions beginning in July. Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland by the end of this Autumn.</p>  <p>  It is the position of the Government that there should be effective investigations into all Troubles-related deaths, regardless of the perpetrator. The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p>  <p>  We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government and will continue to do so, and to caution in the clearest terms against any unilateral action. The Government will continue to engage and work with the British Government and the parties represented on the Northern Ireland Executive on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

Ireland, along with our EU partners, has been a consistent supporter of the annual Resolution put forward by Cuba at the UN General Assembly regarding the US economic blockade, and Ireland again voted in favour of this Resolution at the General Assembly on 23 June last. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department closely follow developments relating to the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which, as the Deputy is aware, is a US federal law that strengthens and continues the  economic embargo against Cuba. I was concerned by the decision taken in 2019 by the previous US Administration to suspend waivers for Title III of the Act, which had protected European persons and entities from its extra-territorial elements. Together with our EU partners, Ireland has firmly and continuously opposed extra-territorial measures that seek to extend the US embargo against Cuba to third countries, as contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade. </p>  <p>  I also regret the inclusion of Cuba on the list of State-sponsors of terrorism by the previous US Administration and I support the statement made by EU HR/VP Josep Borrell in January 2021, noting the negative impact of this decision on foreign direct investment in Cuba, further aggravating the difficult situation of the Cuban people in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The situation in Cuba has not been discussed at the UN Security Council in some time; however, should this issue be brought to the Council agenda during our term on the Council, Ireland will actively engage, in line with our long-standing position.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the lifting of the US embargo on Cuba and my officials, including at the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico which covers Cuba, will continue to monitor the situation closely, in cooperation with our EU partners.</p></reply>

During the sixth session of the Open Ended Intergovernmental Working Group last Autumn, the EU acknowledged &ldquo;the potential of a legally binding instrument to effectively contribute to enhance the level of protection against human rights abuses and violations, and to ensure that countries around the world do not gain undue competitive advantage by lowering human rights.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  In the same statement, the EU set out continuing concerns with the then draft of the proposed treaty.  These included the need for any such instrument to cover all businesses in a non-discriminatory manner; consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; to be realistically implementable and enforceable; and to be capable of garnering support from a critical mass of UN members.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, a further draft of the treaty has been published by Ecuador (as Chair of the Open Ended Intergovernmental Working Group) and is under consideration by the EU and its member states.  Ireland will continue to promote a constructive and engaged approach to the negotiations.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that Ireland is strongly supportive of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were unanimously endorsed by the Human Rights Council in 2011.  Professor John Ruggie, who developed the UNGPs, and did so much to advance the Business and Human Rights Agenda, passed away last month.  I would like take this opportunity to record our appreciation on the  record of the House for Professor Ruggie's invaluable leadership on this area.</p></reply>

In this regard, we hope that agreement can soon be found on the appointment of a Personal Envoy of the Secretary General in order to move forward with the full resumption of dialogue between the parties under the auspices of the UN.  </p>  <p>  During our term on the Security Council, Ireland has called on all parties to respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement of 1991, to fulfil their obligations under international law, including ensuring full respect for human rights, and to refrain from taking any actions that could lead to further destabilisation of the situation on the ground.</p>  <p>  The Council, in UNSCR 2548 of 2020, encouraged the parties to the conflict to develop and implement independent and credible measures to ensure full respect for human rights as well as enhanced cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), including by facilitating visits of the High Commissioner to the region.</p>  <p>  As part of the Security Council&rsquo;s consideration of the mandate renewal process in October, the Special Representative of the Secretary General and Head of MINURSO will update the Council on the situation.</p>  <p>  In the mandate renewal process, as in all our work across the Council agenda, Ireland will continue to promote respect for human rights, accountability and compliance with international law.</p></reply>

This event drew attention to what the Security Council can tangibly do to address climate related security challenges, including in conflict-affected regions in Africa. During this debate, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland would convene a discussion on a thematic resolution on Climate and Security, which would be a major step forward for the Council.</p>  <p>  In addition, as co-chair of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security at the Security Council, Ireland is working to raise awareness on climate related security risks and how these can be acted upon. To date, this year, we have held meetings on the Sahel and South Sudan. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been working to secure language in Security Council mandated peacekeeping operations to enable the inclusion of risk assessments and risk management strategies to help address climate related security risks. </p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland is providing targeted finance to address this challenge, including funding for a UN Climate Action Officer in Somalia, through the UN Volunteer Programme.  One of the messages which Minister Coveney received during his visit to Somalia in July was the increasing interplay there between climate change and security risks.  Irish Aid supports a research project, Weathering Risk, which aims to analyse how climate change undermines peace as well as to strengthen the abilities of governments and international organisations to act in affected regions.  Additionally, through the bilateral programmes managed by Irish Embassies in Africa the Irish Aid programme is helping mitigate the effects of climate change.</p></reply>

Approximately 60% of those applications are first-time applications. First-time applications are complex to process. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant, take measures to ensure the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship and, in the case of children, confirm that all guardians have consented to the issuing of the passport. Accordingly, the current processing time for first-time online applications is 40 working days. </p>  <p>  In contrast, simple adult online renewal applications are currently processed within 10 working days and, in almost 45% of cases, they are being issued within one business day. </p>  <p>  A number of Departmental staff have been on-site throughout the pandemic. In August 2021, there were 519 staff assigned to the Passport Service. Of these, less than 1% were working from home on a full-time basis. From 20th September, all Departmental staff based in Ireland have been required to attend their respective workplaces one day a week. </p>  <p>  On Monday, 27th September, the Passport Office in Mount Street resumed its Urgent Appointment Service for passport renewal.

It allows a predetermined number of vulnerable people in need of international protection to be granted refugee status in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Places on the programme have been allocated to approximately 370 Afghan nationals, some 150 of whom have travelled to Ireland.  Priority was given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations.  The operation of this programme is managed  by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is, through our diplomatic network, including in Abu Dhabi and Ankara, liaising with relevant authorities in the region and countries in Europe in relation to transit routes. The Department of Justice is providing practical support by way of issuing visas, or visa waivers, to facilitate travel to Ireland. That Department is also focused on processing applications for Afghan family members of Irish citizens and Afghan nationals living in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is currently reviewing all international protection applications on hand from Afghan nationals with a view to expediting their progress, in line with updated advice provided by UNHCR in recent weeks. These applications are already prioritised, as agreed with UNHCR. The processing of these applications takes full account of whether a person will be in danger if not provided with a permission to remain here.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Department of Justice to determine which documents must be submitted in support of visa applications or visa waivers and the extent, if any, to which these may be relaxed. </p>  <p>  The Government at its meeting earlier this week, approved the introduction of a new Afghanistan Admission Programme whereby current or former Afghan nationals resident in Ireland can apply for close family members in Afghanistan or who have recently fled Afghanistan to certain countries to be granted temporary residence in Ireland. I very much welcome this new proposal from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, which will create a tailored reunification programme and enable Ireland to better respond to the situation in Afghanistan.</p></reply>

Our position is that the Stormont House Agreement, which was agreed by the two Governments and political parties, provides the framework to address the legacy of the Troubles. Where there are genuine concerns regarding its implementation, or proposals to further strengthen it in different areas, we are ready to engage together with the parties and the British Government to find a collective way forward. Crucially, victims and survivors must be at the heart of this process. </p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July for a &lsquo;Statute of Limitations&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, have caused significant upset, shock and concern. They represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement and we do not accept them as the basis of a way forward.</p>  <p>  Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward, with discussions beginning in July. Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland by the end of this autumn.</p>  <p>  All victims&rsquo; families must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice in accordance with the law and regardless of the perpetrator. With respect to Bloody Sunday and Ballymurphy, officials in my Department have remained in ongoing contact with the families who have lost their loved ones in both cases, who have campaigned with such dignity and tirelessness for truth and justice for their loved ones, and we continue to offer our support.</p></reply>

The human rights situation in Belarus is appalling. There are over 650 political prisoners in the country, with reported use of torture and sexual assault of detainees. State violence against protesters has extinguished public displays of opposition. Freedom of media has been greatly restricted by the closure of various independent news outlets.</p>  <p>  In response to EU sanctions and support for Belarusian civil society, the Lukashenko regime has weaponised the use of migration against EU borders. Since mid-May Belarusian State entities have been actively transporting migrants, who arrived in Minsk on direct flights from Baghdad or Istanbul, to the borders of Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. Migrants who have been declined entry into the EU but who are not allowed to return to Belarus are effectively &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; at the border. </p>  <p>  The Lukashenko regime must cease the instrumentalisation and abuse of the plight of migrants and refugees. Together with our EU partners, Ireland is continuing to press Lukashenko&rsquo;s regime to cease the repression of the Belarusian people, release political prisoners, and ensure the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as respect for democratic principles. We remain, with our EU partners, firm and united in response to Lukashenko&rsquo;s provocations.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports a sustainable, democratic and peaceful resolution of the current crisis. Our focus remains on seeking such a resolution that leads to fresh elections that are free, fair and independently monitored. We will continue to encourage the regime to begin a meaningful national dialogue with the Belarusian people.</p></reply>

Team Ireland abroad, aided by support teams at home, works constantly to identify and take advantage of new opportunities for Ireland.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025. The Global Ireland initiative aims to see Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint and influence double in the period to 2025, including through an expanded and strengthened Diplomatic presence. This remains the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken. </p>  <p>  By the end of this year, this programme will have opened 14 new missions open and fully operational.  To date new Embassies have opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia, Santiago de Chile and Kiev, and new Consulates General in Cardiff, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Manchester, Mumbai and Vancouver.  Work on the expansion of the Mission network continues including through the planned opening of new Embassies in Manila and Rabat by the end of this year. We will also be reopening our Embassy in Tehran in 2023 and in July this year the Government approved the opening of a further four new Missions in Dakar, Lyon, Miami and Toronto.</p>  <p>  All of the new missions are located in countries that present trading opportunities for Irish business. Indeed, the new Embassies and Consulates opened to date, are contributing to the expansion and deepening of Ireland's international presence across priority regions, providing opportunities to grow our trade and inward investment, strengthening our political relationships with our partners, promoting our values, and supporting Irish citizens and our diaspora abroad. </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Department of Taoiseach and other Government partners to deliver on the Global Ireland plan. We are collaborating closely with Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and others on the &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; model which will provide co-located facilities for all departments and agencies involved in Team Ireland. We are also focused on increasing our efficiency and effectiveness through greater Team Ireland mobility with an increased deployment of staff from across Government Departments to key strategic locations. This has been complemented by the expanding presence of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in key markets and by the strengthening of strategically important missions (including Brussels, Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, New York (UN), Tokyo and Beijing). Over the lifetime of Global Ireland, my Department has the objective of further strengthening the existing mission network. </p>  <p>  In considering any further expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s mission network, a range of factors will be taken into account including our national, political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.</p></reply>

The EU side took note of the fact that some progress has been made regarding real-time access to relevant databases and recalled the need that all work should be finalised by the end of the year. The EU also expressed its concerns regarding the lack of progress on Border Control Posts, as well as the issue of export declarations from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. The EU updated the UK on the ongoing work to implement flexibilities regarding the movement of live animals between Great Britain and Northern Ireland that it announced in June. </p>  <p>  The Commission confirmed that it will soon come forward with a package of measures, within the framework of the Protocol, addressing the issues that matter most to the people of Northern Ireland, including on medicines.</p>  <p>  Outside of the Specialised Committee, we welcome the continuation of technical talks between the two sides on outstanding matters on implementation of the Protocol. As has been made clear by the Commission however, the Protocol will not be renegotiated. </p>  <p>  Our approach, shared by our EU colleagues, continues to be informed by regular engagements with people and business across Northern Ireland, taking on board their genuine concerns, as we seek realistic solutions. The clear message we have received is that most people in Northern Ireland &ndash; especially those in the business community &ndash; want the Protocol to work well. They see the very real opportunities presented by the Protocol and want these opportunities to be fully realised. </p>  <p>   On 9 and 10 September, Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic paid a very well received visit to Northern Ireland. His openness to engaging with political, business and civic representatives clearly demonstrates the EU&rsquo;s wish to hear and understand the concerns of the people on the ground. Vice President &Scaron;efcovic made clear the EU&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to the people of Northern Ireland and their focus on the issues that matter most to them.  I remain in regular contact with Vice President &Scaron;efcovic and we spoke most recently on 27 September where we discussed the Protocol.  I also briefed the Commissioner on my visit to Washington, and the continued strong support received from the US Congress. </p>  <p>  We remain confident that solutions do exist, within the parameters of the Protocol, for the issues that have arisen to date.

This has helped multilateral partners such as the COVAX Facility and WHO to accelerate the equitable distribution of vaccines to Low and Middle Income Countries, as well as strengthening the health systems of partner countries so that they can mount effective vaccine campaigns.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supplemented financial support to COVID-19 response with in-kind support, including an initiative I spearheaded between Irish Aid, the HSE and partner countries to assist the mental wellbeing of health practitioners during this time of strain.  This initiative sees the sharing of Irish best practice with partners.</p>  <p>  With the maturing of the vaccination programme here in Ireland, earlier this month the Government committed to donating 1 million COVID-19 vaccines to the COVAX Facility by the end of 2021.  A further substantial donation will follow next year.  The Irish Aid programme is complementing the donation of vaccines with a &euro;7 million contribution to the COVAX facility this year, to ensure that in kind donations can be used effectively and to facilitate vaccine purchase by COVAX also.   A further 335,500 Astra Zeneca vaccine doses have been donated bilaterally to Uganda, supplemented by an in-kind donation of necessary equipment from the HSE. This shipment will arrive in Kampala this week. These doses will provide a much-needed boost to the vaccine programme there, and help get basic services such as health and education back on track.</p></reply>

The engagement was a very useful follow-up to her meeting with the Taoiseach in March, as well as my previous engagement with Speaker Pelosi in September 2020.</p>  <p>  The discussion focused mainly on developments with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland and EU-UK relations post-Brexit, issues in which the Speaker has shown a strong interest, and which she has also discussed in the past week with British Prime Minister Johnson. I thanked Speaker Pelosi for her support for the peace process and stability in Northern Ireland, and took the opportunity to update her on Ireland and the European Union's position on the Protocol and on Brexit. We also discussed Ireland-UK trade in the post-Brexit context. </p>  <p>  The meeting also briefly touched on the upcoming COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the consistent engagement of the US Congress on the peace process in Northern Ireland, which continues to attract support on a bipartisan basis across the political system in the United States. Limiting the challenges posed by Brexit in Northern Ireland will be essential in the period ahead and support from the United States will continue to be critical in protecting our shared achievements and making further progress into the future. We will continue to ensure that the Irish perspective is heard and understood in Washington through high-level contact, as well as through the ongoing engagement by our Embassy.</p></reply>

The Independent Expert Panel proposal provides a new definition of the crime of ecocide, which seeks to serve as the basis for consideration for an amendment of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This amendment, if accepted by the States Parties to the Rome Statute, would see ecocide included as an international crime, alongside genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. </p>  <p>  The ICC is the first permanent, international criminal court and was established by the 1998 Rome Statute to end impunity for perpetrators of the world&rsquo;s most heinous crimes. Ireland is a State Party to the Rome Statue and a strong supporter of the ICC as the cornerstone of a system of international criminal justice. As with all proposed amendments to the Rome Statute, it is for States Parties individually to assess the merits of the proposal in the first instance. If there is sufficient support among States Parties for an agreed definition of ecocide, a formal amendment can be considered by the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statue. As such, the UN Security Council has no role in this process.</p>  <p>  I have followed this initiative with great interest since its publication in June 2021. The proposal to agree a legal definition of ecocide and to subsequently include it as a new international crime in the Rome Statute is in its very early stages and will require careful consideration and analysis. My officials will engage in discussions on the important implications of this proposal with our international partners, both within the EU and with other fellow States Parties to the Rome Statute.</p></reply>

Following its registration, the European Commission has six months in which to consider the initiative and any potential proposals arising from it. </p>  <p>  Ireland has previously raised at EU level the question of whether goods from occupied territories, including from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, should be excluded from the EU market altogether. However, it is clear that at present there is no possibility of getting substantial support, still less consensus, for such a proposal. </p>  <p>  We have therefore instead focused our advocacy on practical measures to differentiate in EU policies between Israel itself and the illegal settlements. This has resulted in a number of EU measures already, including guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods (so that consumers can identify them and make their own choices in this matter), and exclusion of settlement institutions from EU research funding. </p>  <p>  Settlement goods are already excluded from the normal lower tariffs applying to goods from Israel and other countries with which the EU has trade agreements, when they are imported into the EU. </p>  <p>  I have directed my officials to continue to explore further such options, as well as the potential for them to gain support from EU partners.</p></reply>

I have continued to engage regularly on these issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and with the Northern Ireland parties. Where there are legitimate concerns, be they in relation to the outworking of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol, or other issues, we will continue to listen and to engage.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to co-chair the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in June. The BIIGC is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement, and it was positive both that it met for the first time since 2019, and that we agreed that it would be convened again in November. We were able to discuss how we can, together, best support the stability of all institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. There were also important discussions around the need to make progress on addressing the legacy of the past, and a process of intensive engagement of these issues is underway.</p>  <p>  We look forward to continued engagement with counterparts from the Northern Ireland Executive through the North South Ministerial Council. The Government is also continuing to progress the commitments that were made at the time of the New Decade New Approach Agreement, which are focused on working with the Executive to deliver projects that benefit people across the island.</p>  <p>  The Reconciliation Fund also plays a key part in demonstrating in a very practical and tangible way the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The Reconciliation Fund awards grants to 150-200 projects each year, and these projects build meaningful links across communities, addressing the issues that are impacting on people&rsquo;s lives, and working to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work with both the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive for strengthened peace and stability.</p></reply>

Ireland has repeatedly emphasised that the rights of children to protection, safety, and well-being must be upheld at all times.</p>  <p>  I fully endorse the statement of 9 September 2021 by European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, on the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, which underlined that attacks on education constitute violations of International Humanitarian Law.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been active on this issue in the UN Security Council. In my address to the Council on 16 May, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at the plight of children in the occupied Palestinian territory. I stressed that all violations against children must end, including and in particular attacks on schools.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of education for Palestinian youth, which is crucial for the long-term economic viability of a Palestinian state. Ireland is a longstanding supporter of UNRWA&rsquo;s delivery of services, including quality education, to 5.7 million registered Palestine refugees.</p>  <p>  This year, Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million to UNRWA, including &euro;1 million in additional emergency support in response to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip in May. Ireland also provided &euro;500,000 to UNICEF for the provision of essential supplies and services to thousands of children in acute need in the West Bank and in Gaza and &euro;300,000 to the oPt Humanitarian Fund.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the Palestinian Ministry of Education in providing equitable access to quality education for children.  </p>  <p>  Irish officials will continue to engage actively on the ground and by supporting Israeli and Palestinian civil society partners who play a critical role on this issue.</p></reply>

As famine-like conditions are reported, there is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and the commencement of political dialogue to find a resolution to the conflict.   </p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious human rights violations and abuses.  It is vital that perpetrators be held to account.  Ireland strongly supports the work underway by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to investigate reported atrocities. The publication of their joint report on 1 November will be a crucial step towards accountability.   </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to take the lead at the UN Security Council to ensure a focus on the situation in Tigray. Ireland spearheaded calls for the most recent open Council meeting on 26 August, where we called for an urgent end to the violence, full humanitarian access, accountability for atrocities, and for a political solution to the conflict.  Minister Coveney met with Ethiopia's deputy Prime Minister, Demeke Mekonnen, in New York on 21 September, where they discussed the situation in his country.   </p>  <p>  The Government continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  EU Foreign Ministers will discuss Ethiopia again in October. On 15 September, Minister Coveney met with the EU Special Representative on the Horn of Africa, Dr Annette Weber, to discuss options for addressing the conflict.   </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority will remain, as always, supporting the needs of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia, including those affected by conflict in Tigray. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, has provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground. On 7 July, I announced additional humanitarian funding of &euro;2.7 million for Ethiopia, to address hunger and insecurity, including in Tigray.</p></reply>

As a result, its construction and filling has been the cause of escalating tension between Ethiopia on the one hand, and Sudan and Egypt on the other. Against the background of new conflict dynamics in the Horn of Africa, this dispute poses a potential challenge to regional peace and security. </p>  <p>  Ireland views the African Union (AU)-led negotiation as the best framework within which to address the concerns of the parties and develop a comprehensive agreement on the GERD. We actively support the role played by the European Union in bolstering this process, particularly through the engagement of the Office of the EU Special Representative on the Horn of Africa.</p>  <p>  In July 2021, a second filing of the GERD took place in Ethiopia, leading Sudan and Egypt to increase diplomatic efforts to secure Security Council engagement. The Council discussed the issue on 8 July, at the request of Tunisia. This was followed by a Presidential Statement, adopted on 15 September, which reinforces the key role of the AU in facilitating the parties to reach a mutually acceptable and binding agreement.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation closely through our missions accredited to Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, and look for ways to continue to support the AU-led process on the GERD, including through EU engagement as an observer to the talks. </p></reply>

As the work plan agreed under a Joint Declaration seeks to advance institutional links between the EU and NATO, this Declaration will be agreed between the leaders of the two institutions, rather than individual EU Member States or individual NATO Allies.   </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes greater EU-NATO co-operation where it contributes to international peace and security and is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards as this ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.   </p>  <p>  The multi-annual financial framework (MFF) is the EU's long term budget. The 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework includes a separate heading dedicated to security and defence. While the European Union (EU) has previously financed action linked to security and defence, this is the first time that this policy area has been identified in this way in the EU budget structure.   </p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) which forms part of the MFF, is an instrument intended to foster competition and innovation in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The final budget of just under &euro;8 billion will be split between a research budget of &euro;2.651 billion, and a capability budget of &euro;5.302 billion. It should be noted that the EDF is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for Common Security Defence Policy operations.   </p>  <p>  The European Peace Facility (EPF) is a European Union off-budget financing mechanism of up to &euro;5bn (&euro;5.7bn in current prices), designed to finance a range of Common Security Defence Policy (CSDP) actions having military or defence implications for the period of the 2021 to 2027 MFF. Off-budget means that although financed by Member States contributions, the EPF does not form part of the overall EU budget. The EPF replaces and expands on the scope of the former Athena Mechanism, which funded the agreed common costs of CSDP operations, and the African Peace Facility which operated between 2004 and 2021.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the proposed Summit on European Defence, the level at which it may take place - whether at the level of Heads of State and Government or Ministers for Defence - has yet to be determined.  Ireland remains ready and willing to engage on a constructive basis in the discussion in accordance with Ireland's key objectives for the EU's Common's Security and Defence Policy. Ireland always endeavours to participate in meetings in all Council formations in order to ensure that Ireland's position is articulated fully and that Ireland's influence on policy development is maximised.</p></reply>

While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, there are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.</p><p>I have acknowledged the on-going staffing challenges in the Defence Forces and these have been well-documented. Initiatives to counter those challenges and play a role in restoring and retaining capacity and boosting specialist numbers include:</p><p>- Continuing Recruitment, which has resulted in a total of 406 personnel being inducted as at 27th September.  A further 95 General Service recruits have accepted offers and will commence training on the 4th October.  The Cadet competition is at offer stage and the process is expected to close on the 22nd October.  Further inductions are also anticipated. </p><p>- The scope of direct entry competitions was expanded in 2021, from 10 competitions, to also include a new Air Corps Aircraft Technician competition which resulted in 3 recent inductions. Additionally, direct entry terms and conditions continue to be revised to further improve intakes. In 2021, the maximum age of entry for Technicians was increased to 29 and flexibility in the starting rate of pay of some Naval Service specialists was progressed. </p><p>- The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues and has resulted in 1 re-commissioned officer and 28 re-enlisted personnel, to date, in 2021.</p><p>- The sea-going service commitment scheme and an extension of a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures that I have introduced which are aimed at retaining experienced personnel. This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.</p><p>There has been significant progress on pay arising from increases from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1st October 2020. The new public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo; provides for an increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on October 2021, with further increases to follow.</p><p>I am confident that the pay benefits delivered by the Public Service pay Agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC's recommendations will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently being experienced by the PDF.  15 projects, most of which are now complete, were undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the PSPC&rsquo;s recommendations. These included projects focused on a broad range of non-pay measures and also included 4 projects relating to immediate pay which have provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. I have recently received the final report for the Review of Recruitment project and the Workforce Planning Project is being progressed through the joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group.  These projects will inform recruitment and retention policy.</p><p>Additionally, the independent Commission on the Defence Forces is examining a range of recruitment and retention matters and I look forward to receiving their recommendations, which will be considered and implemented as appropriate.</p><p>My focus remains on retaining and restoring the PDF to its full capacity but there is no quick fix to the challenges facing the Defence Forces today. As I have outlined, there has been significant work undertaken to date, and such work continues, but it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced.</p><p>More information is available at the following link: <a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-10-01_pq97-30-09_en.xlsx">Ranks</a></p></reply>

In addition I am also looking forward to engaging with the associations at the upcoming PDFORRA Annual Delegate Conference on 6 October 2021 and the RACO Biennial Delegate Conference on 23 November 2021 and hearing the issues of interest and concern to their members.</p></reply>

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way. For this reason compulsory retirement ages for ranks in the Permanent Defence Force are considerably lower than in other employments.</p><p>The Public Service Pay Commission in their report on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force, included in their recommendations, the need to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force, including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>A review of contracts of service of personnel who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994, is currently being conducted by civil and military staff. The Review is considering appropriate mandatory retirement age limits for Privates, Corporals and Sergeants, as well as senior Non-Commissioned Officers.</p><p>The Review is taking into consideration the recommendations from an Adjudication in 2015, arising from a claim PDFORRA made through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  </p><p>In 2019, agreement was reached with PDFORRA that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022, (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel meet certain criteria, including medical grades and fitness tests, during the interim period. This agreement was subsequently extended to include Sergeants recruited to the Permanent Defence Force, post 1st January 1994, who can also continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.</p><p>This agreement with PDFORRA provides for such personnel to continue in service to allow for this review to be completed in an extended timeframe.</p><p>A draft report of the review has been submitted to me. There will be consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to discussions with PDFORRA on the recommendations arising from the Report.</p></reply>

This can make taking up a position in the private sector very attractive where a full-time position, even at the same rates as those in the Defence Forces, could lead to an increase in an individual&rsquo;s earnings.</p><p>In that context, I have fully acknowledged the retention issues affecting both officers and enlisted personnel.  A range of actions have been taken to address these issues which includes the 15 projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the PSPC Report on Recruitment and Retention. Most of these projects have been completed with others being considered in the context of wider public sector pay arrangements. These include:</p><p>- 4 projects relating to immediate pay have provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. </p><p>- Also completed are projects on non-pay retention measures, enhanced professional military education; bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, , the consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas and a review of technical pay groups. </p><p>- A project to examine workforce planning in the Defence Forces has been progressed through a joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group and will inform recruitment and retention policy.</p><p>Other measures undertaken, aimed at retaining capacity, include:</p><p>- The Service Commitment Scheme for pilots, introduced in 2019, which has had a stabilising effect on Air Corps pilot numbers, with 25 officers currently participating.  A further iteration of the Scheme is scheduled in Q4 2021.  </p><p>- A Naval Service Sea-going Service Commitment Scheme, aimed at retaining experienced personnel and incentivising sea going duties, was also introduced this year with 81 applications received to date.  .</p><p>- A sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270, which was applied in the 2020 tax year, has been extended for the 2021 tax year, and has been increased to &euro;1,500.</p><p>Complementing these retention measures, the following recruitment initiatives are playing a role in countering the current staffing challenges:  </p><p>- Ongoing General Service recruitment, maximising the Defence Forces training capacity.</p><p>- The expanding scope of direct entry competitions along with reviews of direct entry terms and conditions to further improve intakes. </p><p>- The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF which resulted in 1 re-commissioning officer and 28 re-enlisting personnel in 2021.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the terms of reference of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, the Commission is considering appropriate turnover and retention approaches, having regard to work undertaken to date and international best practice, to deliver the capabilities required of a modern military force.  I look forward to receiving the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff, I remain committed to maximising recruitment and retention of both men and women to maintain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.</p><p>More information is available at the following link: <a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-10-01_pq97-30-09_en.xlsx">Ranks</a></p></reply>

It is essential, therefore, that Ireland remains fully engaged in all CSDP processes and contributes fully to the development of the policy in order that we can influence its evolution.   </p>  <p>  When the Defence Forces deploy overseas, our women and men never do so alone. We always work in close cooperation with other countries deployed on such operations.   </p>  <p>  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Under PESCO, Member States come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  It is a means of enhancing interoperability with our future project partners, something that will be of great benefit for our troops on future missions overseas. Ireland is currently a Participant in one PESCO project (the Greek-led Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance project) and has Observer status on a further nine PESCO projects.  Our level of participation in PESCO is something we keep under review and any such participation is undertaken only with the approval of the Government and the Dail.   </p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that Defence is a national competence and any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Through our participation in CSDP initiatives like PESCO and the Coordinated Annual Review of Defence, Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions and to meet any commitments agreed as part of our participation in such initiatives.  </p></reply>

The strength of the First Line Reserve at that date is 262 personnel and as of the same date, the Naval Service Reserve has a strength of 125.</p><p>While the Government remains committed to restoring the strength of the RDF, given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is, and will remain a priority.  However, RDF recruitment will also be progressed to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>The Military Authorities have further advised that a revised Defence Forces framework for living with COVID -19 is now in place, based on the recent easing of Government restrictions.This revised framework, I understand, affords more scope for RDF Training within the parameters of Government guidelines, and is facilitating the commencement of the RDF Induction Process with planned induction training to commence shortly.

These include:</p><p>- 4 projects relating to immediate pay have provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. </p><p>- Also completed are projects on non-pay retention measures, enhanced professional military education; bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy,  the consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas and a review of technical pay groups. </p><p>- A project to examine workforce planning in the Defence Forces has been progressed through a joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group and will inform recruitment and retention policy.</p><p>Other measures undertaken, aimed at retaining capacity, include:</p><p>- The Service Commitment Scheme for pilots, introduced in 2019, which has had a stabilising effect on Air Corps pilot numbers, with 25 officers currently participating.  A further iteration of the Scheme is scheduled in Q4 2021.  </p><p>- A Naval Service Sea-going Service Commitment Scheme, aimed at retaining experienced personnel and incentivising sea going duties, was also introduced this year with 81 applications received to date.  .</p><p>- A sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270, which was applied in the 2020 tax year, has been extended for the 2021 tax year, and has been increased to &euro;1,500.</p><p>Complementing these retention measures, the following recruitment initiatives are playing a role in countering the current staffing challenges:  </p><p>- Ongoing General Service recruitment, maximising the Defence Forces training capacity.</p><p>- The expanding scope of direct entry competitions along with reviews of direct entry terms and conditions to further improve intakes. </p><p>- The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF which resulted in 1 re-commissioning officer and 28 re-enlisting personnel in 2021.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the terms of reference of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, the Commission is considering appropriate turnover and retention approaches, having regard to work undertaken to date and international best practice, to deliver the capabilities required of a modern military force.  I look forward to receiving the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff, I remain committed to maximising recruitment and retention of both men and women to maintain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

The National Cyber Security Centre in his Department is the national response authority for cyber security incidents. But, of course, response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The primary responsibility of the Defence Forces relates to the defence and security of their own networks and systems. However, as in any emergency situation, once Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and Defence Forces provide support to the National Cyber Security Centre. For example, during the recent cyberattack on the HSE, the Defence Forces played an important role in supporting the response to it including provision of operational support to the HSE and, in particular, logistical and organisational support.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  To this end, officials from the Department of Defence and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in implementing the National Cyber Security Strategy such as through secondment of an officer to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Estonia and departmental membership of the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  This Inter-Departmental Committee has recently been charged with the additional work of overseeing the plan to significantly expand the National Cyber Security Centre so that it can further develop its competence and capacity to help defend and protect IT systems and key services into the future.  </p>  <p>  For operational security reasons, no public comment will be made regarding Defence Forces Cyber Capability but I would note that the establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030. Amongst the issues that the Commission is examining are Defence Force capabilities, structures and staffing in a number of areas. I expect that a report will be produced for consideration by Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p> The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020, completed through extensive joint civil-military work, provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over a five year period. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrades and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  I am committed to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, having regard to the financial envelope available.  Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.  </p>  <p>  The level of capital funding available will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>   The Government has established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020, with a mandate to report within 12 months.   The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the the future development of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The aim of the strategy is to provide a coordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.</p>  <p>  Eight supporting objectives (Governance, Resilience, Suicide, Stigma, Critical Incident Stress Management, a Comprehensive Approach, Military Families and a Model for Clinical Support) have been identified as essential components of the strategy to support the principal aim. It is intended that at the end of 2023, mental health and wellbeing support within the Defence Forces will be delivered in a coordinated, multi-disciplinary and directed manner that is designed to produce the best outcomes for the organisation and the military personnel and their families.</p>  <p>  On 2nd November 2020, the Deputy Chief Of Staff (Support) issued an order for the convening of the Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Standing Committee which has responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. The Committee is chaired by the Officer In Charge of the Defence Forces Personnel Support Services and includes representatives of all subject matter experts in the area of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The committee has selected 15 milestones from the strategy for initial consideration during 2021. Each milestone has been allocated to a working group consisting of selected members of the Standing Committee and other key personnel and subject matter experts as required. Work plans have been created and the Working Groups report monthly to a full meeting of the Standing Committee. At these meetings progress achieved is assessed and guidance offered to counter obstacles or to provide direction for action. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, completed Working Group reports with associated documents will form the basis for a report on the working of the Standing Committee for the period, along with interim reports for Working Groups which are scheduled to continue into 2022. It is expected that the Defence Forces will then be in a position to proceed with the implementation of a Mental Health Strategy for 2024-2029, which will look to build on the progress achieved and ensure the effective delivery of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces to the end of the decade.</p></reply>

Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), MSA was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.   This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was published in January 2001 and was considered and broadly accepted by the Government.  This Report was the first comprehensive examination of public service occupational pension arrangements since the foundation of the State.  The Commission was an independent body and had invited submissions from interested parties, giving those concerned an unprecedented opportunity to put their case on occupational pension issues.  I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the Commission.  </p>  <p>  In its Report, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service pensioners generally.  However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned.  Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service and retired teachers.  </p>  <p>   In the context of the Government&rsquo;s subsequent consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated and, accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</p></reply>

It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The priority of the Defence Forces Joint Task Force from the beginning has been to provide support to the Health Service Executive (HSE), while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.</p><p>To date, the Defence Forces personnel have provided significant supports in response to the Covid-19 crisis, with in excess of 109,000 man days and there have 22,000 instances of vehicles being deployed in an extensive range of supports from the Defence Forces.  This has provided surge support to our health services through bolstering their capacity and providing them with the additional resiliency needed to respond to the Covid 19 pandemic. </p><p>The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis included:</p><p>operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>- support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>- transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>- collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>- support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>- PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>- provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>- transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>- a range of non clinical and administrative supports in a number of residential care home facilities; </p><p>- assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>- production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>- the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p><b>Vaccination Programme</b></p><p>The Defence Forces provided logistical and operational planning advice for the national vaccination programme.  </p><p>Vaccinator support has been provided by the Defence Forces across a number of vaccination centres and Long Term Residential Care settings. </p><p>Through the Joint Task Force, the Defence Forces has also supported the rollout of the vaccination programme through:</p><p>- Marshalling, administration, logistical and security supports at a number of vaccination sites</p><p>- Secure storage supports</p><p>- Transportation of vaccinators in adverse weather conditions</p><p>- Transportation of vaccines by air at the request of the National Ambulance Service. </p><p><b>Mandatory Quarantine Scheme (MQS) </b></p><p>The Department of Health is the competent authority and has overall responsibility for implementation and operation of the system of MQS in accordance with the Health (Amendment) Act 2021 and associated regulations.</p><p>It had been agreed that the Defence Forces, acting in an Aid to Civil Authority role, would provide 24/7 assistance and support to the new mandatory quarantine requirements for passengers arriving from &lsquo;designated states&rsquo; in accordance with the Health (Amended) Act 2021 through fulfilling the role of the State Liaison Officer.  This role provided for the day to day oversight and quality assurance of the Mandatory Quarantine System. The Defence Forces role was confined to designated airports, ferry ports and at mandatory quarantine facilities.</p><p>A Service Level Agreement was put in place between the Department of Health and the Department of Defence for the provision of the Defence Forces support to the Covid 19 MQS.  </p><p>Under this SLA, the roles fulfilled by the Defence Forces under the State Liaison Official function were:</p><p>- Overarching State Liaison Official (SLO) role. The DF provided a senior officer to hold the appointment of the SLO who was the official representative of the State for the MHQS. A designated officer was also appointed to the role of Deputy SLO. </p><p>- Assistant State Liaison Official (ASLO) role at Dublin Airport.</p><p>- Assistant State Liaison Official (ASLO) role at Cork and Shannon Airports.</p><p>- Terminal Liaison Official (TLO) role at Dublin Airport.

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 349 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 134 personnel.Ireland also contributes observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU, NATO/PfP and OSCE headquarters.</p><p>Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the United Nations and UN Peacekeeping.  Our commitment and support for the primary role of the United Nations, in the maintenance of international peace and security, is expressed in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations.  This commitment is also expressed in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).</p><p>The conditions under which the Defence Forces may participate on overseas peace support operations are set out in the Defence Acts.  Where the Defence Forces contingent comprises part of an International United Nations Force, the conditions, known as the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;, must be satisfied, that is the operation must be authorised/mandated by the United Nations; it must be approved by the Government; and it must be approved by way of a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, where the size of a Defence Forces contribution is more than twelve personnel. No D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval is required where members of the Defence Forces are deployed in a training role, which is consistent with the provisions of Section 3(1)(b) and 3 (1)(d) of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006.</p><p>Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the following factors are taken into account:  </p><p>- An assessment of whether a peacekeeping operation is the most appropriate response. </p><p>- Consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy. </p><p>- The degree of risk involved. </p><p>- The extent to which the required skills or characteristics relate to Irish capabilities. </p><p>- The existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution. </p><p>- Whether the operation is adequately resourced.  </p><p>- The level of existing commitments to peacekeeping operations and security requirements at home. </p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces Personnel overseas.  The changing nature of demands and potential future mission profiles need to be considered in the context of assets and capabilities which can be made available by the Defence Forces for overseas deployment, given existing operational demands at home and overseas.</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving in missions overseas are listed in the following table. </p><p><b>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS</b></p><p><b>AS OF 1 September 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>UN MISSIONS </th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ<br /><br />UNIFIL 118th Infantry Battalion<br /><br />UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td>       <td>9<br /><br />336<br /><br />4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MINUSMA (United Nations mission in MALI)</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic of the Congo) </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UNDOF (COS Staff/FHQ Staff - Camp Faouar - Bravo side)<br /><br />UNDOF 63rd Infantry Group (Camp Faouar - Bravo side) </td>       <td>8<br /><br />126</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>511</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EUFOR (EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EUTM Mali (EU-led Training Mission) </td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Naval Service EU Mission (Op Irini HQ) </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL NUMBER  OF PERSONNEL SERVING  WITH UN MISSIONS</td>       <td>552</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group, Vienna</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brussels</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td>       <td>3*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Military Representative in PSC Delegation (Brussels)</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td>       <td>574</td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <td>* Includes Major General Maureen O'Brien serving on secondment to the United Nations following her appointment by the UN as Deputy Military Advisor in the Office of Military Affairs, Department of Peace Operations</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews. The reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments. Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are represented on the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, my Department introduced a pilot quota-based scheme to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  This pilot scheme proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and 150 permits were made available to the dairy sector. These three quotas created for dairy farm assistant, horticulture worker and meat processing operative have now been filled.</p>  <p>  A review of the occupations lists for employment permits is currently well underway with submissions received from a range of sectors - including from the dairy sector - which are under active consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised in the coming weeks with any changes necessary to deal with verified skills or labour shortages taken at that time.</p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county in Ireland with over 257,000 premises surveyed as of 17 September. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and premises are now connected in Cork, Cavan, Galway and Monaghan. Retail Service Providers are actively selling on the NBI Network with almost 23,000 premises (across Cavan, Cork, Limerick, Monaghan and Galway) now available for order and pre-order through local broadband service providers</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas across the country through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p><p>Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, , which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 September, 373 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-map/. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

The development of the national retrofit plan to achieve these targets is well underway.  Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes, including the Solar PV scheme and the Building Energy Rating programme, of which &euro;113 million is Carbon Tax revenue.</p>  <p>  Of the total budget, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households with the balance of &euro;112.5 million to be spent on expanding existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives.</p>  <p>  Of the overall capital allocation for 2021, &euro;48.9 million has been spent as of 16 September and over 5,600 homes have been retrofitted.  It is important to note that extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April had a significant impact on activity this year. Output has also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials. Every effort is being made to maximise output over the coming months.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Given that prices are not regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. The position of successive Governments, for almost twenty years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices.  Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers and this can mitigate the impact of price rises for consumers.    Protections are in place for those falling into difficulty with their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to engage with them as early as possible. Suppliers are also obliged to offer a range of payment options, such as a debt-repayment plan for a customer in arrears. Where possible, suppliers must also offer customers with difficulties paying their bills a prepayment meter or budget controller. </p>  <p>  Income supports including the Fuel Allowance and the Household Benefits Package are available from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to help households with the costs of heating their homes. The Fuel Allowance payment, of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;784 from October to April, will be provided to approximately 370,000 low-income households. The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. In addition, DSP also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can include support with fuel bills in some cases. </p>  <p>  Improving the energy efficiency of a home can also help to protect households from energy poverty. This year, &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been allocated to SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households. An Additional &euro;65 million is allocated to improve the energy efficiency of social housing.</p></reply>

This provides advice urging vigilance at all times on the part of consumers and listing suggestions for the proactive steps to be taken by those receiving scam calls, and in particular, advising people not to answer, or to call back any number which they do not recognise or where there is a bland or no voicemail left.  The notice also provides a phone number for consumers to contact and the Regulator also offers a text call back service and other facilities to assist consumers.   </p>  <p>  I understand that An Garda Sioch&aacute;na has also raised public awareness to warn phone users on the need to remain continually alert with respect to calls and text messages</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is no immediate technical or (telecoms) legislative solution to scam calls, or smishing. I understand  that industry operators are actively analysing the position at network level and the matter continues to be monitored by the Regulator.</p>  <p>  The advice to the public remains focussed on the importance of being vigilant.</p></reply>

This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and premises are now connected in Cork, Cavan, Galway and Monaghan. Retail Service Providers are actively selling on the NBI Network with almost 23,000 premises (across Cavan, Cork, Limerick, Monaghan and Galway) now available for order and pre-order through local broadband service providers</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas across the country through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website, www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 September, 373 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-map/. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website, at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to the provision of cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer such insurance products and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific situation of cardiac patients, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland to get a view.  It noted that life insurance products are designed to provide financial support to customers in the event of death or ill-health and insurers are keen to ensure that cover is available where it is needed.  They set out that it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants, including those with cardiac conditions.  They noted that an insurer is obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy and this will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of this product depends on a number of factors.  In this regard, applicants are asked questions about various conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, strokes and any specific cardiac conditions in order for the insurers to assess the risk involved.  They concluded that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria, and if higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment then the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and that cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.</p>  <p>  With regard to the points made in relation to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, as the Deputy will be aware it is no longer part of the Single Market, including for insurance. As part of the extensive preparations for the end of the withdrawal transition period, European and domestic regulatory authorities, including the Central Bank of Ireland, instructed relevant UK/Gibraltar firms to make and implement contingency plans to ensure that they could continue to provide services to their EU customers post-Brexit.  I understand from the Central Bank that a significant majority of these undertakings implemented such measures.  Therefore, these insurers should be able to continue to offer insurance business to Irish customers. Insurance Ireland also informed my officials that it is unaware of any insurer selling life insurance in Ireland that has exited due to Brexit.</p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

This exemption also applies to childminding, childcare and child protection/ education services.

To note, section 59 (2) provides that VAT may only be deductible insofar as the goods and services are used for taxable supplies. Only persons making taxable supplies of goods and services or qualifying activities can reclaim VAT charged on goods and services used for the purpose of their taxable trade.</p></reply>

It recognises the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unfair to tax income earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties unless this is specifically provided for in legislation. Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.  However, based on public information as to pre-COVID-19 profitability levels,  a limit (be it 25% or 50%) on the Corporation Tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the relevant companies.  </p>  <p>  A five-year restriction on the carry forward of losses could mean that these companies would no longer be able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis. However, the likely additional tax yield from such a measure would depend on future profitability levels of the banks and it is not possible to estimate this accurately at present. It is further noted that, if losses forward were to be restricted in this manner, future profitability is likely to be offset to some extent by current losses arising during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  It is important to understand that the State is actually getting value from these tax losses through share sales. In addition, despite the scale of losses accumulated, the banks contribute to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy. </p>  <p>  In 2018 Department of Finance officials produced a detailed technical note for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally (see www.gov.ie/en/publication/436ff7-technical-note-on-the-potential-consequences-of-changes-to-the-treat/). It was further updated and re-circulated to members during the 2019 Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

Many submissions contain proposals across a range of taxes and allowances that are of particular relevance to the sector in which the person or representative organisation operates. Some are from individuals describing their personal circumstances to place their proposals in context.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that many representative organisations publish their pre-budget submissions on their websites and see it as part of their communication strategy with their members. The vast majority of these pre-budget submissions are sent electronically to my office in the Department of Finance and this is the preferred method of receipt.</p>  <p>  I can confirm my office has received the Macra Na Feirme and the Irish Cancer Society submissions respectively. The contents of both submissions will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget. </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings; thereby reducing the regulatory and financial burden associated with this type of development. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.</p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The SEA process, involving a public consultation on the proposals, is currently underway and is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021. </p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in early 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.</p></reply>

The NQSF specifically provides that service users are safeguarded and protected from abuse and their safety and welfare is promoted where services are provided.  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework.  This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the NQSF arrangements.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive are in the process of reframing the quality assurance arrangements under the NQSF to cover all privately operated facilities and this regime is due to be in place shortly.</p></reply>

The aim was to provide rent certainty to tenants and landlords by moderating medium-term rent levels. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduced the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. </p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that an index, other than HICP, may be prescribed for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I intend to consider all the legal options available to me to ensure that effective rent controls are legally in force in RPZs to cap the rate of any rent increase where the general inflation rate is too high. I intend to bring forward the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021 before the end of this D&aacute;il term and any necessary provision relating to rent control in RPZs will be considered in this context.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining this matter and the advices of the Office of the Attorney General will inform any changes in this area.</p></reply>

The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the Customs Union and Single Market produced inevitable and unwelcome consequences for the island. Even with the Withdrawal Agreement and Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, the seamless trade we enjoyed with  Great Britain when we were both members of the Single Market cannot be replicated as was. The Government has dedicated substantial time and resources into preparing for Brexit since 2016 and continues to do whatever it can to mitigate against disruption caused by Brexit.</p>  <p>  At an early stage in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiations, both the UK and the EU acknowledged the unique circumstances on the island, recognising the necessity of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border and protecting North-South cooperation. The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements is an utmost priority for this Government. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process, while at the same time protecting the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it.</p>  <p>  I am in regular and ongoing contact with political leaders and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland in relation to the implementation of the Protocol, as well as with Commission Vice President Maros &Scaron;efcovic, fellow EU Member State colleagues, and British Government counterparts. </p>  <p>  Our approach, shared by our EU colleagues, continues to be informed by engagements with people and businesses across Northern Ireland, taking on board genuine concerns as we seek realistic solutions within the framework of the Protocol. Throughout these engagements, the clear message we have received is that most people in Northern Ireland &ndash; especially those in the business community &ndash; want the Protocol to work well. </p>  <p>  However, stability, certainty, and predictability are required to realise the opportunities which the Protocol presents for Northern Ireland. This can only be achieved by the UK and the EU jointly agreeing solutions to outstanding issues. In this regard, we welcome the continuation of technical talks between the two sides and the latest meeting of the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on 24 September. </p>  <p>  We take unionist concerns in relation to the Protocol seriously and we will continue to listen and engage with those concerns, just as we have with the perspectives of everyone across Northern Ireland. It is important to reiterate that the Protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  We remain confident that solutions do exist, within the parameters of the Protocol, for the issues that have arisen to date. The EU has consistently demonstrated a considered, credible, solution-driven approach to these issues. We will continue to encourage the UK to work in partnership with the EU in a spirit of positive and constructive engagement in order to identify pragmatic and sustainable solutions.</p></reply>

In addition, 500,000 children, aged 6 to 59 months are suffering from acute malnutrition.  This is likely to deteriorate further over the coming months, which are the traditional lean season.  My officials, including through the Embassy of Ireland in Maputo and engagement with the UN humanitarian system, continue to actively monitor the situation in Madagascar.</p></reply>

During this time, we chaired all meetings of the Council and were responsible for managing its agenda. </p>  <p>  The Council Programme of Work for September included meetings on a range of important issues, including Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and the Middle East Peace Process. I chaired a meeting of the Security Council on the situation in Afghanistan on 9 September, and Ireland engaged extensively in the negotiations to extend the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan for six months from 17 September. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council provided an important opportunity to highlight a number of our policy priorities, and we convened three High-Level signature meetings in September.</p>  <p>  On 8 September, Ireland chaired an Open Debate of the Security Council on peacekeeping operations and on 9 September, I was very pleased to preside over the unanimous adoption of Resolution 2594 on peacekeeping transitions that was drafted and negotiated by Ireland. This important resolution provides a framework for ensuring that the reconfiguration of a UN presence is properly planned for and resourced, particularly with respect to protecting civilians. I also chaired an informal interactive dialogue with the League of Arab States on 22 September. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach chaired a High-Level meeting on Climate and Security on 23 September, during the UN General Assembly High Level Week. At that meeting, the Taoiseach announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention, along with Niger, to convene discussions with all Council members, on a thematic resolution on Climate and Security. A resolution on the link between climate change and the maintenance of international peace and security would be a first for the Security Council and would allow it to better assess and address the effects of climate change in its work. </p>  <p>  Minister Byrne chaired the third signature High-Level meeting on 27 September to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This meeting provided an opportunity to highlight the importance of the CTBT and the need for entry into force and universalisation of the Treaty.</p>  <p>  Ireland prioritised the Women, Peace and Security agenda during our Presidency to support the right to full, equal and meaningful participation of women in matters of peace and security. We also placed a particular focus on including women peacebuilders in Council meetings as civil society briefers, as we believe it is crucial that the Council hears the voices of those affected by its decisions. </p>  <p>  Throughout our Presidency, we continued our work to protect human rights, uphold International Humanitarian Law, and promote accountability for violations. Over the next 15 months of Ireland&rsquo;s Security Council membership, we will continue to work openly and constructively with all partners, as a solution-oriented member of the Council.</p></reply>

As provided for in the agreement, the first Implementation Review meeting took place in January of this year, and a second is planned for the period immediately ahead, to review progress made to date.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) is essential to overseeing and developing North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, including the implementation of the NDNA Agreement. The important work of the NSMC to develop cooperation on an all-island basis resumed in 2020, and three successful NSMC plenary meetings have now taken place, as well as a number of Sectoral meetings at Ministerial level. Progress is underway with respect to these commitments that come under its remit &ndash; we look forward to this progress being continued and seeing these commitments implemented in full.</p>  <p>  The 35th summit of the British-Irish Council (BIC), hosted by the Northern Ireland Executive, took place on 11 June. Former First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill welcomed all administrations to the summit, which included in person and virtual attendance. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, and I attended in person and the UK side was represented in person by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, and Secretary for State for NI Brandon Lewis. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford attended virtually. The summit discussion consisted of firstly addressing recovery and planning for potential impacts following Covid-19, and secondly a discussion regarding latest political developments and ongoing work and future of the BIC. The Council noted that the next BIC Summit would be hosted by the Welsh Government.</p>  <p>  I also attended the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) on 24 June alongside my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Heather Humphreys, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, and the former Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Robin Walker. The Conference was established under Strand Three of the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The meeting allowed for discussion of a wide and positive agenda of East-West and economic and security cooperation. We were also able to discuss how we can, together, best support the stability of all institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. There were also important discussions around the need to make progress on addressing the legacy of the past. As agreed at the BIIGC, the Government has joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of intensive engagement of these issues, with discussions beginning in July. The BIIGC is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement. It was positive to see it take place for the first time since 2019, and we agreed that the Conference should meet again in November.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach raised the matter in March this year while meeting with President Biden during his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit.

It allows a predetermined number of vulnerable people in need of international protection to be granted refugee status in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Approximately 370 places have been allocated to Afghan nationals under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and some 150 of those have arrived in Ireland.  Priority was given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations.  My colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth considers requests for refugee status.  My officials transmit requests received to his Department for consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government at its meeting earlier this week, approved the introduction of a new Afghanistan admission programme. Under the new programme, current or former Afghan nationals resident in Ireland can apply for close family members in Afghanistan, or who have recently fled Afghanistan to certain countries, to be granted temporary residence in Ireland. I very much welcome this new proposal from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, which will create a tailored reunification programme and enable Ireland to better respond to the situation in Afghanistan. Up to 500 places will be available under this programme. The current possibilities for Afghan nationals to be granted permission to enter Ireland will continue in parallel to the new programme.</p></reply>

In these discussions, Ireland has called for a peaceful and negotiated political settlement, and we have placed a very strong emphasis on the need for any new administration to guarantee the protection of civilians, to fulfil Afghanistan&rsquo;s obligations under international law, and to respect human rights, especially for Afghan women and girls. We have highlighted the worsening humanitarian situation as a top priority, and have also consistently called for the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans who wish to leave the country.  </p>  <p>  On 9 September, I chaired a Security Council debate on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Speaking at that meeting, I stressed that Kabul airport and Afghanistan&rsquo;s land borders must be fully open and operational, both to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to ensure that Afghans and foreign citizens can safely depart. I also emphasised the need for full and safe humanitarian access to allow life-saving support to reach all Afghans, and called for the full respect of the human rights of all Afghans, including women and girls as well as minorities. </p>  <p>  It is critically important that the UN can continue to do its vital work in Afghanistan and, in this context, Ireland played an active role in the negotiation of UN Security Council Resolution 2596, adopted on 17 September, which renewed the mandate of UNAMA for a further 6 months. </p>  <p>  Ireland was also actively engaged in the negotiation of Resolution 2593, which was adopted on 30 August. This called on the Taliban to respect its commitments to allow the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghans and foreign nationals who want to leave, and for the re-opening of Kabul Airport and enhanced airport security. </p>  <p>  We supported the Security Council Press Statement of 27 August, which was issued in response to the appalling terrorist attacks near Kabul Airport, and which called on all relevant parties to respect and facilitate the safe evacuation of civilians. Ireland was also actively engaged in the negotiation of the Security Council Press Statement adopted on 16 August, which emphasised the need for all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law in all circumstances, including those related to the protection of civilians, and underscored the particular vulnerability of humanitarian and medical personnel, interpreters and other international service providers.</p>  <p>  We will continue to prioritise the situation in Afghanistan in our work on the Security Council, and to do whatever we can to help ensure that at-risk Afghans can safely leave the country. </p>  <p>  Our work on the Security Council complements our other activities in support of the Afghan people, including our ongoing efforts to provide refuge here in Ireland for some of those who are most at risk.</p></reply>

It is the result of over four years of difficult negotiation with compromises on all sides. It was designed to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect vital all-island supply chains, and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p>  <p>  By virtue of the Protocol, Northern Ireland effectively remains within the EU Single Market for the movement of goods. It also provides that the Union Customs Code continues to apply in respect of Northern Ireland &ndash; ensuring no customs processes are necessary for movements (in either direction) between Northern Ireland and the European Union, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Protocol has been of vital importance in protecting cross-border trade and all-island supply chains. Cross-border trade has grown significantly in the years since the Good Friday Agreement, strengthening a growing prosperity across the island of Ireland. This has been particularly important for small businesses, which account for the vast majority of cross-border trade. </p>  <p>  While EU-UK engagement is ongoing around implementation of the Protocol across a number of outstanding issues, ensuring continued free movement of goods North-South is not in question.</p>  <p>  The Government dedicated substantial time and resources to ensuring that businesses were prepared for the post-Brexit context. For those trading on a cross-border basis, whether in goods or services, InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Advisory Service also provides a range of practical advice, support, and information for businesses on Brexit related issues.</p></reply>

All citizens can and should use their voice and have their say as part of the Conference process by attending events or submitting their ideas to the online digital platform created for the Conference. I am also pleased that Dublin has been selected as a host city for one of the four European Citizens&rsquo; Panels which will take place in early December.</p>  <p>  A key strategic priority of this Government is to maintain engagement with the EU Institutions. Since March 2020, much of this has been conducted on a virtual basis. As society re-opens, it is the intention across Government that Ministers re-engage with Ministerial counterparts in other Member States and with the EU Institutions, most notably but not exclusively with, the European Commission and the European Parliament. The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Career for EU Strategy&rdquo; is also a key priority. The strategy aims to increase the number of Irish people working for the EU Institutions and agencies in order that Irish EU officials can continue to act as important channels of interaction and influence between our national system and the EU Institutions.</p></reply>

There are currently 12 UN peacekeeping operations worldwide, with over 95,000 uniformed personnel from over 120 countries. This is a global effort to which Ireland is fully committed &ndash; with contributions from the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Ireland is present in half of the current UN peacekeeping operations.</p>  <p>  UN peacekeepers are increasingly deployed to complex and volatile environments, making it vital that peacekeeping operations are designed to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and focus on the protection of civilians. To this end, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres launched a peacekeeping reform initiative in 2018, known as Action for Peacekeeping. This aims to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, stronger operations, increased support for political solutions, and better-equipped and trained forces to strengthen protection of civilians. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the Secretary-General has launched a new phase of reform with Action for Peacekeeping Plus, which incorporates the use of technology and the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda across its priorities. Ireland is fully supportive of this initiative. </p>  <p>  During our time on the Security Council, Ireland is working to ensure that the mandates for peacekeeping missions align with the needs of the people they seek to protect, and that missions have the resources necessary to carry out their tasks. </p>  <p>  We also believe that peacekeeping missions need to be designed with the aim of making themselves obsolete; this is why Ireland was so determined to secure agreement on Security Council Resolution 2594. This resolution provides a framework for how to ensure that the reconfiguration of the UN presences during a transition is properly planned for and resourced, most especially with respect to protecting civilians. Its adoption is a testament to our leadership on peacekeeping and our commitment to making UN peace operations as effective and responsive as possible.</p></reply>

The rights of women and children are central to our engagement and especially so in regards to conflict zones where risks of child recruitment or trafficking in persons are particularly prevalent. </p>  <p>  Conflict continues to fuel human rights violations and abuses across much of the world, and remains the most significant driver of humanitarian crises, while the number and complexity of these crises globally continues to increase. Each conflict is unique in its character, scale and complexity, and as such cannot be ranked by any single set of criteria of severity.</p>  <p>  This month alone, at the UN Security Council, Ireland has highlighted human rights issues in meetings relating to: climate and security; small arms and light weapons; UN peacekeeping transitions, as well as in regard to conflicts in Afghanistan; Libya; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria and Yemen. </p>  <p>  The particular human rights violations and abuses encountered by women and children, including sexual and gender based violence issue, crosscuts all of our engagement on both conflict and human rights.  In addition to co-chairing the Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, Ireland is also a member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict which addresses the issue of child soldiers and ensures follow up of the recommendations at country level.  </p>  <p>  Longer-term, we also support the reform of the Security Council itself and continue our efforts in this regard. </p>  <p>  Ireland also has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 550 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  The Government is committed to participation in peacekeeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security. </p>  <p>  On 9 September, I was very pleased to preside over the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 2594 on peacekeeping transitions that was drafted and negotiated by Ireland. This important resolution provides a framework for ensuring that the reconfiguration of a UN presence is properly planned for and resourced, particularly with respect to protecting civilians and upholding human rights. It also encourages national governments to develop national plans, policies and strategies for the protection of civilians. </p>  <p>Ireland also engages actively at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). At the 47th   session of the Council beginning on 21 June, Ireland made national statements on a broad range of thematic issues and country-specific human rights situations including in regard to violence against women. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador also delivered a national statement in response to the report from UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, with whom my Department meets regularly. Ireland provides core funding to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) with whom we work in partnership on the many aspects of counter-trafficking responses including prevention, protection, and prosecution </p>  <p>  At the ongoing 48th session of the Human Rights Council Ireland&rsquo;s national statement under item four highlighted grave concerns about the human rights and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan; Tigray and neighbouring regions of Ethiopia; the occupied Palestinian territory; and Yemen. It additionally highlighted our serious concerns about the human rights situation in Belarus and Myanmar where elected politicians, together with media and civil society face severe restrictions on their rights to freedom of movement and expression. In the context of increased authoritarian restrictions globally, Ireland will also join a Joint Statement supporting the right to peaceful protest. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also member of the core group presenting the HRC resolution in response to the current report from the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen. This is the only UN mandated international, independent mechanism working towards accountability for the Yemeni people. Our Ambassador also intervened in response to reports from the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar and the Commission of Inquiry on Syria.</p>  <p>  At European Union (EU) level, Ireland is an active participant and contributor to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security. Human Rights issues feature prominently at the meetings I attend at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials engage extensively on human rights issues at the relevant Council-level working parties including on the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime which strengthens the EU&rsquo;s ability to take collective action against perpetrators of human rights violations. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassies also engage actively in support of the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-24); on EU led Human Rights dialogues; and through financial support from Irish Aid in relevant countries. </p>  <p>  Ireland prioritises accountability, including for crimes such as genocide or ethnic cleansing, not only as a means of pursuing justice for victims, but also as a crucial component to create stability and peace in post-conflict situations. A strong international criminal justice system is central to fighting impunity. While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, including war crimes and genocide, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. Ireland, together with its EU partners is a consistent and strong supporter of the Court. We will continue to support and defend the Court throughout and beyond our term on the United Nations Security Council, whilst ensuring that accountability remains one of the key principles underpinning our engagement at all levels.</p></reply>

The roots of hunger lie in poverty, deprivation and exclusion, exacerbated by conflict and climate change: COVID-19 has amplified all of these drivers. Insecurity is a barrier to providing timely and effective assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a long-standing champion of global efforts to reduce hunger and starvation, working with a range of development and humanitarian partners. </p>  <p>  At last week&rsquo;s Food Systems Summit, Ireland played a key role in the coalition on Zero Hunger. The action of this coalition, in the run up to the December Nutrition for Growth Summit in Japan, will focus on mobilising resources, and focusing efforts on coordinated, effective interventions in priority hunger hotspots. </p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council, Ireland is playing a leading role on hunger, in particular through our work on Resolution 2417 on hunger and conflict. Discussions at the Council also address issues such as starvation as a weapon of war and the denial or impeding of humanitarian access.</p>  <p>  The Irish National Task Team for Rural Africa, a collaboration between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, a number of State agencies, NGOs and representatives of Irish agribusiness companies, has made a number of recommendations to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s food systems contribution in Africa. Work is ongoing to implement those recommendations, including better coordination and targeting of the provision of Irish expertise on nutrition in Africa. </p>  <p>  At present, Ireland holds a seat on the Executive Board of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which provides an opportunity to champion issues of hunger and nutrition in its work, as well as across the Rome-based Agencies. </p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, and through our Embassies on the ground, we will continue to closely monitor hunger crises across the globe, supporting political efforts to resolve conflicts, advocating for resource mobilisation, and championing effective responses. In 2020 (the last year for which figures are available), Ireland spent at least &euro;193 million on projects that addressed hunger. As set out in A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, our overseas assistance will continue to target those furthest behind, and continue to relentlessly focus on preventing hunger.</p></reply>

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians and humanitarian workers and facilities. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, Ireland is tackling poverty, hunger and exclusion which can be drivers of support for groups such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. Also, as a Member State, Ireland contributes to the significant European Union development and humanitarian response in Somalia, and in countries affected by Boko Haram.  </p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has contributed &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region.  This includes funding to Concern Worldwide, Goal, and Plan International Ireland, as well as to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region. Ireland is penholder, together with Niger, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and both attacks and threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including recent abductions in Nigeria.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid provides funding to support those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance: both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;56.4 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas.  With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.  The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al-Shabaab. Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council. That Committee oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia, including engagement with Al Shabaab. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions.  </p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission.  In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to peace and security, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for sustainable development.</p></reply>

Early on in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiations, both the EU and the UK  acknowledged the unique circumstances on the island. They recognised the necessity of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, avoiding a hard border and protecting North-South cooperation.</p>  <p>  Following years of intense negotiation, the Protocol was agreed between the EU and the UK in October 2019. It was conceived as a stable and lasting solution. The Protocol avoids a hard border, enabling the smooth functioning of the all-island economy and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. It protects the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market, and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it. </p>  <p>  Where issues of concern have arisen around implementation, we are confident that solutions do exist within the parameters of the Protocol itself. We must bear in mind that many of the issues of concern to people and businesses in Northern Ireland flow directly from the form of Brexit pursued by the UK Government.</p>  <p>  As demonstrated by Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic&rsquo;s recent visit to Northern Ireland, the European Union is taking a solutions-oriented approach, aimed at addressing the matters of concern to people and businesses in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  While the EU will continue to engage constructively to find solutions to genuine issues arising around implementation of the Protocol, it is important to be clear that the Protocol is not up for renegotiation. </p>  <p>  We will continue to encourage the UK Government to work in genuine partnership with the EU towards seeking stable and sustainable solutions that will enable Northern Ireland to gain the full benefit of the Protocol to support trade, investment, and jobs, developing the prosperity of the region.</p></reply>

Our  readiness work continues to be underpinned by a strong communications and outreach programme.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy the Government is very much aware of the challenges that Brexit brings for businesses, in particular for the agri-food and farming sector on the island of Ireland.  Support teams from across Government continue to engage directly with companies, representative organisations or individuals to help them navigate challenges caused by Brexit. This ranges from 24-hour in-person support at Dublin Port, to a huge offering of webinars and online guidance providing targeted, sector-specific advice.  Ministers continue to meet with stakeholders across a range of fora. There is further detail on all our supports at Gov.ie/Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Brexit presents additional challenges and costs for the agrifood sector and our rural economy with further changes for exporters coming next year when the UK introduces its new import controls. The Department of  Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is devoting considerable time and resources to assisting all companies to prepare.  It is vital that exporters use the time available to get ready for these new controls.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the allocation of resources from the &euro;1 billion allocation Ireland has received from the EU&rsquo;s Brexit Adjustment Reserve will focus on the most impacted sectors.  Allocations from the BAR are being aligned with the annual estimates process.</p>  <p>  The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland means that no new procedures apply to the movement of goods, including agri-food goods, between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or the rest of the EU.  This presents opportunities for Northern Ireland and for the all island economy.    We continue to encourage the UK to work in partnership with the EU in a spirit of positive and constructive engagement in order to identify pragmatic and sustainable solutions to the outstanding issues around the implementation of the Protocol.</p></reply>

The budgeted ODA allocation for 2021 was &euro;868 million, estimated at 0.32% of GNI.  If current trends of strong economic growth continues, ODA will need to continue to increase in real terms in order to achieve modest increases as a proportion of GNI. My Department is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable way. </p>  <p>  This also includes working in coordination with other Government Departments and bodies spending Official Development Assistance, and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on allocations to ODA. The allocation for ODA for 2022 will be determined through the ongoing budget process.</p>  <p>In growing the allocation to ODA, it is important that Ireland continues to provide a quality international development programme.  The strong global reputation of the Irish Aid programme was confirmed by the OECD in its periodic Peer Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Development Assistance, published last year.</p></reply>

The aim of the strategy is to provide a coordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.</p>  <p>  Eight supporting objectives (Governance, Resilience, Suicide, Stigma, Critical Incident Stress Management, a Comprehensive Approach, Military Families and a Model for Clinical Support) have been identified as essential components of the strategy to support the principal aim. It is intended that at the end of 2023, mental health and wellbeing support within the Defence Forces will be delivered in a coordinated, multi-disciplinary and directed manner that is designed to produce the best outcomes for the organisation and the military personnel and their families.</p>  <p>  On 2nd November 2020, the Deputy Chief Of Staff (Support) issued an order for the convening of the Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Standing Committee which has responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. The Committee is chaired by the Officer In Charge of the Defence Forces Personnel Support Services and includes representatives of all subject matter experts in the area of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The committee has selected 15 milestones from the strategy for initial consideration during 2021. Each Milestone has been allocated to a working group consisting of selected members of the Standing Committee and other key personnel and subject matter experts as required. Work plans have been created and the Working Groups report monthly to a full meeting of the Standing Committee. At these meetings progress achieved is assessed and guidance offered to counter obstacles or to provide direction for action. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, completed Working Group reports with associated documents will form the basis for a report on the working of the Standing Committee for the period, along with interim reports for Working Groups which are scheduled to continue into 2022. It is expected that the Defence Forces will then be in a position to proceed with the implementation of a Mental Health Strategy for 2024-2029, which will look to build on the progress achieved and ensure the effective delivery of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces to the end of the decade.</p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>The Defence Forces have received pay increases in line with the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2020. </p><p>The restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation was also restored from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2020. </p><p>In addition to the general round of pay increases awarded to public servants, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Force allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission. These included: </p><p>- a 10% increase in military service allowance, </p><p>- the restoration of a 10% cut applied to a number of Defence Forces allowances under the Haddington Road Pay Agreement </p><p>- the restoration of premium rates for weekend security duty allowances. </p><p>- the restoration of a service commitment scheme for pilots. </p><p>The introduction of a new sea-going service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel, which came into effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021, is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel, while also incentivising sea going duties. </p><p>Furthermore, a sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 was applied in 2020 for members of the Naval Service who served 80 days or more at sea in 2019. This tax credit has been extended for a further year and is increased to &euro;1,500 for the 2021 tax year. </p><p>Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations. A new agreement &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions. Following a ballot of their members the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, namely RACO and PDFORRA, formally notified the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) of  their intention to comply with this agreement.  </p><p>In return for ongoing reform and productivity measures the agreement provides for further increases in pay to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. This agreement includes the following increases:</p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1<sup>st </sup>October 2021. </p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1<sup>st </sup>February 2022. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1<sup>st</sup>October 2022.</p><p>Notably, all Defence Force personnel also receive three additional public holidays over and above the public sector norms. These additional holidays are specific only to members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. This provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15<sup>th</sup>December 2020. On completion of the Commission's work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 crisis.   Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway, with the recent return to operations of L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n and work commencing on L&Eacute; Niamh.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.   The MRV project is currently underway and will be progressed over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  There is also a multiannual mid-life maintenance and upgrade programme in respect of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers.  When completed, this will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. The upgrade of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot was also completed during 2020. Other major projects are also in train.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills.  The full spectrum of personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise.  Further inductions have taken place throughout the year as recruitment continues.  The Air Corps Apprentice competition closed in March 2021, and attracted 663 applications.  General Service recruitment is ongoing and the Cadet competition was also launched recently.  This is in addition to the 9 current Direct Entry competitions and the Re-commissioning and Re-enlistment schemes.   I recognise that reaching a strength level of 9,500 personnel is a key challenge but I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the means to continue to carry out all of the roles assigned by Government.  </p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as a natural disaster rests with three designated principal response agencies, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant Local Authority  and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles.  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020, with a mandate to report within 12 months.   The work of the Commission encompasses  the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing and their report will inform decisions regarding the the future development of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish Waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</p>  <p>  On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service. </p>  <p>  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is the immediate project currently under way. The MRV project is an important capability development project and indicative of the commitment to ongoing investment in and development of defence capabilities. The project is included in the Government's National Development Plan as a major capital project and is an important element of the Defence Equipment Development Plan. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and overseas.  </p>  <p>  Following a public tender competition, Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV. This work is now underway and will inform a public tender competition in due course.</p>  <p>  Projects for other vessel replacements are being considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall Equipment Development Plan process.</p>  <p>  In relation to training, I remain committed to ensuring that all personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards. The primary function of training in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the capabilities necessary to enable them to fulfil the roles laid down by Government. The scheduling of training across all three arms of the organisation, including the Naval Service, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding current challenges being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p></reply>

They are invited to make submissions as to how much, if any of the compensation should be taken into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  The Minister then makes a bona fide decision based on a consideration of all circumstances of the case, including the annuity value of the compensation awarded. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Courts, in various previous judgements, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, as he considers proper.</p></reply>

In addition to the principal role of maritime surveillance, particularly fishery protection, the aircraft will also enable the Air Corps to provide a wide range of services including logistics support and transport of troops and equipment, medical evacuation and air ambulance, search and rescue and a general utility role.</p>  <p>  This significant investment in maritime patrol aircraft is an example, which demonstrates my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  </p>  <p>  I also remain committed to ensuring that all personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards. The primary function of training in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the capabilities necessary to enable them to fulfil the roles laid down by Government. The scheduling of training across all three arms of the organisation, including the Air Corps, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements.</p>  <p>  Whilst the Defence Forces are not a primary response agency for non-security related emergencies, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Principal Response Agency in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to Civil Authority (ATCA) role.  In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

Unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces and where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations will be initiated by the appropriate authorities. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces policies and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships and unacceptable behaviour are outlined in Defence Forces Administrative Instruction A7. Complaints of unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour are dealt with by the military chain of command either through the legal/disciplinary process or by administrative action. Administrative instruction A7, Chapter 1, 'Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces" is the Defence Forces' policy document which deals with sexual harassment, harassment and bullying.  I am advised by the military authorities that these complaints are dealt with at different levels, either by way of an informal approach or formal process. Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are available to assist complainants. The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing. </p>  <p>  Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for individuals, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint. Complaints may be submitted orally or in writing to the complainants Commanding Officer, or in the case where they feel themselves wronged by their Commanding Officer, may complain to the Chief of Staff. Notifications are sent to my office and the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces formally when any Chapter 2 complaint is submitted and of its subsequent outcome. </p>  <p>  Under this mechanism there exists further recourse for the complaint to be referred to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for review and recommendation if appropriate. As the Deputy will be aware, the Ombudsman is entirely independent in carrying out his functions in line with the provisions of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces Act, 2004, and his final report, which may include a recommendation on each complaint, is submitted to me for determination. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that in the event that a complaint of a criminal nature is reported, I understand that the standard procedure is that the matter is investigated immediately by the Military Police. Where allegations of serious criminal incidents among serving members are brought to the attention of the Military Police, they are traditionally passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their consideration and investigation who have the lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that earlier this week I met with participants from the Women of Honour group and with a group of serving female members of the Defence Forces, where I had the opportunity to listen carefully to their experiences, in what were very informative meetings. It is clear that there are very strong views that the culture that is pervading, and the application of the current policies, systems and procedures in place for dealing with bullying, harassment, discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual assault have not, and are not, serving all Defence Forces personnel well. I have given my commitment that the serious issues they have raised, will be addressed. </p>  <p>  You will also be aware of the actions being taken to establish an Independent Review, which will be undertaken by external, independent and unbiased experts.  The Review will examine the effectiveness of current policies and procedures dealing with workplace issues, such as dignity, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination. The terms of the Review, which are in the process of being finalised, are being reviewed in light of  recent meetings with the Women of Honour group and with serving female personnel.  Further engagement with the Women of Honour Group on the Terms of the Review is proposed.  In addition engagement with other stakeholders, including with the Representative Associations, is also scheduled, and will additionally inform the terms. </p>  <p> I can assure the Deputy that I, as Minister, working closely with the Chief of Staff, and the Secretary General, am committed to providing a safe place of work for all employees in the Defence Organisation, both male and female. All individuals have a right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity in the workplace, and to carry out their duties free from any form of bullying, gender discrimination, or any form of harassment and to reach their full potential.  </p></reply>

LCPE is designed to be taught in a minimum of 180 hours across 5th and 6th year. </p>  <p>  A Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education (SCPE) has been published by my Department and is designed to support teachers in planning quality learning in Physical Education for all students in Senior Cycle. The non-examinable Framework will assist schools in designing a physical education programme for senior cycle students, including students who do or do not elect to take Physical Education as a subject for their Leaving Certificate examination. From September 2020, the new Framework replaced the existing guidelines for PE at senior cycle. All students in Senior Cycle should be studying SCPE. However, if a student is studying the optional LCPE specification, they are not required to also study the SCPE Framework, although this is not prohibited.</p></reply>

In response to stakeholder requests and in order to extend  the opportunities for all those interested to engage with the process, this consultation is now scheduled to remain open until 30 November 2021.

To support this objective my Department has engaged extensively with all of the education stakeholders and the Department of Health and the HSE Public Health.</p>  <p>  Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and have advised that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. My Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools.  These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are very effective. </p>  <p>  Each school was provided with an updated COVID-19 Response Plan in advance of the return to school.  Significant additional resources of &euro;639m were put into schools in the last academic year to keep schools safe.  </p>  <p>  Further funding of &euro;57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in the last week for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this new term. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. </p>  <p>  At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for Principals and Deputy Principals. Principals have one day per week away from teaching duties to concentrate on leading teaching and learning and administration duties. Teacher Supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide. </p>  <p>  At post primary level over 1000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements in order to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students and ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision.</p>  <p>  All of these measures are remaining in place for this school year. My Department has also provided updated guidance about good ventilation practices and arrangements have been put in place to provide CO2 monitors to assist schools with managing ventilation.  </p>  <p>  The infection prevention and control measures in place in schools have worked very effectively to prevent and control Covid-19 in schools.  The Department will continue to work closely with public health officials and the education stakeholders in respect of the safe operation of schools during Covid-19.</p></reply>

This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of similar employment services across.</p>  <p>  This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  The Phase two procurement, which will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State, including Monaghan, will take on board the learnings of the first phase.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  In relation to references to the &lsquo;privatisation&rsquo; of employment services, the Department has outsourced services to assist and advise long-term unemployed people since the 1990s. No new privatisation is being undertaken in the current procurement process. No service previously undertaken by civil or public servants is in the process of being shifted to the private sector. Intreo will continue to engage with those unemployed for 12 months or less and, under the July Stimulus and in line with the new Pathways to Work strategy, has been given additional resources to do so.</p>  <p>  The Department is in receipt of legal advice from the Attorney General's office that it must procure its employment services in an open and competitive manner in order to meet its legal obligations arising from EU and national procurement rules.</p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns in the sector at the changes to the Local Employment Service model. However, existing service providers with a strong track record and a willingness to cooperate with others in the sector, will be well-placed to submit high-quality tenders for the new services. The new model and its associated procurement process is accessible to the community and voluntary sectors given the model's significant emphasis on service quality and the need to harness local networks and linkages to best support the clients of the new employment service.  </p></reply>

T&uacute;s is delivered locally by a network of 48 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, known as implementing bodies (IBs).  Eligible jobseekers can commence on T&uacute;s following  selection and referral, or assisted self-referral, to the IB that delivers T&uacute;s in their area.  The IB then matches the participant to available T&uacute;s placement opportunities in their locality.</p><p>A key element of T&uacute;s is the placement of participants in structured employment placements within their local community to break the cycle of unemployment. As the objective is to provide opportunities to participants for work within their local communities,  the candidates address is, as far as possible, taken into account when referrals and placements are being arranged.</p><p>Eligible jobseekers are randomly selected for T&uacute;s participation and referred to the IB that delivers T&uacute;s in their area.  The IB to which a jobseeker is ordinarily referred is determined by the address that is recorded for them. However, a jobseeker may choose to refer themselves through the assisted self-referral process to a different IB in an alternative location or county to the one in which they reside.</p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of the number of people who commenced on T&uacute;s by their county of residence in the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and up to the end of September, 2021.</p><p>Throughout 2018 and 2019, continued improvements in the labour market led to a corresponding fall in the number of people on the live register, and decrease in the number of jobseekers that were long-term unemployed and eligible for participation on T&uacute;s.</p><p>Since 2020, the emergence of Covid-19 and the introduction of public health restrictions also impacted on  the number of jobseekers that commenced T&uacute;s. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>132</td>       <td>128</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>123</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>612</td>       <td>506</td>       <td>276</td>       <td>159</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>361</td>       <td>359</td>       <td>228</td>       <td>99</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>1391</td>       <td>1214</td>       <td>504</td>       <td>287</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>432</td>       <td>361</td>       <td>236</td>       <td>81</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>243</td>       <td>173</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>206</td>       <td>205</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>61</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>123</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>91</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>273</td>       <td>202</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>108</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>201</td>       <td>197</td>       <td>127</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>293</td>       <td>281</td>       <td>220</td>       <td>97</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>259</td>       <td>230</td>       <td>210</td>       <td>64</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>104</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>91</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>157</td>       <td>130</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>368</td>       <td>314</td>       <td>221</td>       <td>133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>303</td>       <td>281</td>       <td>202</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>127</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>347</td>       <td>291</td>       <td>237</td>       <td>123</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>275</td>       <td>243</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>65</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>7,019</td>       <td>6,099</td>       <td>3,547</td>       <td>1,694</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The programme aims to improve a persons opportunities to return to the labour market.  The six year participation limit ensures the continued availability of places on CE schemes to those furthest removed from the labour market. </p>  <p>  Following a review of the CE in 2017 a number of new conditions were introduced to further support progression to employment, broaden access to a wider range of people and, to standardise the conditions relating to the length of time a CE participant can remain on a scheme.   </p>  <p>  In general, all placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  However, participants working towards a major educational award can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable them to reach the required qualification standards. Those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and who commenced on CE prior to the introduction of the changes in 2017 continue to be eligible to remain on CE for six consecutive years.  </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to certain criteria.  In total, 10% of CE placements are available under the service support stream. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that contract extensions were provided to CE and T&uacute;s participants at various stages of the Covid 19 pandemic to ensure that participants were not disadvantaged by restrictions on CE activities during the pandemic and to support the ongoing delivery of essential services where it was safe to do so.  A final contract extension has been provided to those CE and T&uacute;s participants until October, 2021 and they will leave their respective schemes on a phased basis thereafter.  </p>  <p>  Given that these exceptional supports are still in place, it is not possible to estimate any potential drop-off in numbers due to the six year participation limits, until normal activity has fully resumed.   My Department continues to monitor the position closely and is acutely conscious of the need to ensure that placements on the scheme will continue to be available to the long term unemployed, including the new cohort of long-term unemployed those whose jobs are permanently lost due to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  RSS is an income support programme that provides part-time employment opportunities within community and voluntary organisations in local areas for farmers or fishers in receipt of Farm/Fish Assist, or certain other social welfare payments, and who are underemployed in their primary occupation.</p>  <p>  Participation on RSS is by self-selection with applications made directly to one of the implementing bodies (IB) that deliver the scheme locally. IBs are required to promote and publicise RSS to the best of their ability.</p>  <p>  The six-year limit on RSS participation was introduced on 1st February 2017 as part of a Government decision to introduce a set of broader reforms to employment support schemes. The number of places available on RSS was also increased by 750 throughout 2017 and 2018.  </p>  <p>  The rule change was introduced at a time when participation on RSS was increasing to ensure that places on the programme would continue to be made available to new candidates, while also helping to avoid any long-term dependency on RSS from existing participants.  </p>  <p>  The six-year limit on RSS only applies to participants who joined the scheme after 1st February 2017. RSS participants who were already on the scheme at that date are not affected.  The first RSS participants who will  leave RSS based on the six-year rule will not take place until after February, 2023.   </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of the Community Employment and RSS schemes and will continue to support and improve the schemes for the benefit of both the participants and their communities, while ensuring that these placements are available for the current cohort of long term unemployed.</p></reply>

Entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department operates the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme which is a group of benefits for people injured or incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from work. The scheme also covers people who have contracted a disease as a result of the type of work they do. There are a number of benefits available and there are different conditions attached to each benefit. The benefits include: Injury Benefit, Disablement Benefit, Incapacity Supplement, Constant Attendance Allowance and the Medical Care Scheme.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 does not constitute a prescribed disease or illness as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as it does not meet the criteria laid down in the Act.  Section 87 (2) of the Act states that a disease or injury shall be prescribed for the purposes of this section in relation to any insured persons, where the Minister is satisfied that&mdash;</p>  <p>  (a) it ought to be treated, having regard to its causes and any other relevant considerations, as a risk of their occu­pations and not as a risk common to all persons, and</p>  <p>  (b) it is such that, in the absence of special circumstances, the attribution of particular cases to the nature of the employment can be established or presumed with reason­able certainty.</p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  It is payable for up to two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  An enhanced Illness Benefit is payable for up to ten weeks for people diagnosed with Covid-19, subject to ongoing medical certification.  In a case where a person continues to be ill with Covid-19 beyond ten weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  </p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are &ldquo;permanently incapable of work&rdquo; because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and medical condition and is not means tested. </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance (DA) is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for other schemes.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  As set out above, a comprehensive set of income support payments is in place for those experiencing illness and disability, based on a person&rsquo;s medical condition and either their social insurance contributions or means testing.  It is generally the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work rather than the nature of the illness or disability that is taken into account when eligibility is being assessed.</p></reply>

My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives. </p>  <p>  The primary data-source for the ELC and SAC sector is the Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile. In the most recent published report (the 2019-20 report, published in 2021), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high. </p>  <p>  Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in ELC and SAC services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. </p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC.</p>  <p>  In addition, work on a Workforce Development Plan for ELC and SAC continues, with a final report expected by the end of the year. </p></reply>

Data is routinely collected from a variety of sources for this purpose. Local Authority level data is captured annually through the Early Years Sector Profile, administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.  Owing to COVID, capacity data is not available for 2020. Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups, and in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring that supply is sufficient to meet demand is a policy priority. </p>  <p>  A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available - by 27,433 places nationally since 2015. New data on capacity was collected in May and June 2021, and is expected to be available in the latter part of the year. This will allow the Department to update our data on capacity at a Local Authority level, which will inform future planning and funding priorities. My Department has also committed to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand, by including undertaking a regular national needs assessment.

The NCS pays subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme incorporates rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is continuously absent from the service, or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  These rules are intended to be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent and recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  The rules reflect the realities of family life. They do not disadvantage parents or services for what would be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p></reply>

Refugees will be assisted with access to services such as education and health by the IRPP to accelerate their integration to Irish society. </p></reply>

We are prioritising all such applications and processing them speedily and sympathetically. </p>  <p>  All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary. Guidelines in this regard are posted on the Immigration Service website (www.irishimmigration.ie). Supporting documents are vital because they provide information about the applicant&rsquo;s circumstances and identity. It is the applicant&rsquo;s responsibility to satisfy the Visa Officer that a visa should be granted for the purpose sought.</p>  <p>  The applicant must provide evidence of any claimed relationship to a sponsor in the State. The responsibility to show proof as to the genuineness of the relationship rests on the applicant and their sponsor. The nature of the evidence required will depend on the relationship claimed. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, my Department must be able to determine the identity of the applicant, whatever documentation is provided. As commercial flights have resumed from Kabul airport, the applicant must have a valid passport to travel by commercial airline. The Visa Office also require original passports in order to place the visa sticker into them.  </p>  <p>  The visa fee is an administration fee which covers the cost of processing an application and is not a charge for the visa itself. That remains the case, even in current circumstances. </p>  <p>  Any requests for fee waivers are considered on a case by case basis. To determine if an application may be fee waivered, the sponsor should contact the relevant Visa Office in Abu Dhabi and outline in detail their circumstances.</p>  <p>  The contact details for this office can be found at the following link: www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/uae/contact-us/visa-queries/  </p>  <p>  As with all visa services worldwide, the overarching concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who are entitled to come to Ireland. </p></reply>

We also recognise that the policy and operational responses of a number of other Ministers and agencies will continue to be crucial in meeting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. </p>  <p>  We have also agreed that other recommendations in the audit should be considered as part of the development of the Third National Strategy on DSGBV.</p>  <p>  This new strategy will place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. I am determined it will be the most ambitious to date and will be published before the end of the year. The strategy will build on the experience of the last two strategies, the learning from the priority given to this work during the pandemic and the commitment and expertise of all bodies involved. </p>  <p>  The audit outcome, the current review of accommodation needs undertaken by Tusla and the ongoing work of implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey, will all feed into the development of the next National Strategy on DSGBV.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to have a draft strategy ready for a further round of public consultation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This new Strategy is being co-designed in partnership with the sector. It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and will radically improve services and supports for victims. The strategy is on track to be developed by my Department in consultation with all relevant Departments and stakeholders with a view to it coming to Government for approval before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that the Government has considerably strengthened the law and structures targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, as part of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021. Implementation of the strategy is monitored on an ongoing basis by a monitoring committee which is made up of representatives from state agencies and the community and voluntary sector, including Women&rsquo;s Aid.</p>  <p>  Central to this is the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January 2019.  Other developments in this area include the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent, and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which provides a wide range of measures and services to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the Criminal Justice system.</p></reply>

Work on the General Scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill is at an advanced stage. The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme shortly. There is a clear path towards the regulator being established in early 2023.</p>  <p>  When it is established, the regulator will have the necessary enforcement powers for licensing, and powers to take action where individuals or operators are failing to follow rules and regulations.  Operators offering activities in whole or in part online, will be subject to the licensing terms and conditions as set out by the regulator. Matters regarding enforcement will also be for the gambling regulator.</p>  <p>  Key objectives of the regulator will be ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way for companies to make decisions in certainty, requiring safeguards including in relation to gambling advertising and preventing gambling from being a source or support to crime.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task. </p>  <p>  Further details on the functions and powers of the regulator will be outlined in the Scheme. </p></reply>

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows:  </p>  <p>  - Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). </p>  <p>  - Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). </p>  <p>  - Children aged 12yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team. </p>  <p>  - Children aged 12yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.</p>  <p>Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf</p>  <p>   The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily  </p>  <p>  - Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease </p>  <p>  - Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings </p>  <p>  - Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting  </p>  <p>  - Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.</p>  <p>  On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test.

Orthodontic treatment is provided to patients with the greatest need. </p>  <p>  Through waiting list initiatives, the HSE also procures orthodontic care through private service providers. Since 2016 approximately 2,000 patients have received treatment in this way.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme, operational from 1 January 2021 for 12 months on an administrative basis, enables persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for private healthcare, including orthodontic care, in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland. Patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU Cross Border Directive Scheme in EU/EEA countries. </p>  <p>  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy (2019) provides a framework to transform oral health services and will facilitate better oral healthcare for everyone. The Policy supports the development of clinical care pathways to ensure that some aspects of orthodontic care, where appropriate, will be more readily available in a primary dental care practice. Stakeholders including the Dental Council will have an important role in progressing these aspects of the Policy, which will be implemented on a phased basis.  </p></reply>

The project commenced on 17th May 2021 with a 13 month works programme. The project could not commence earlier due to levels of Covid Infection presenting at UHW. </p>  <p>  It is expected the main Contractor will hand over the project by the end of June 2022. Equipping and commissioning will follow for a period of 2 months and the Cath Lab is expected to be available for operational use from September 2022 onwards.</p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services at UHW should cease to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The then Minister for Health asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on its progress. Work has now recommenced on the Review to progress this with a view to completion over the coming months. As part of this, the Steering Group, under the Chairship of Prof Philip Nolan, has reconvened and a meeting was held on 20th September.</p>  <p>  As the issues raised in the deputy&rsquo;s question are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The National Maternity Strategy recognises the importance of improving and standardising bereavement care throughout our maternity services and recommends the implementation of the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. The Standards are designed to enhance bereavement care services for parents who experience a pregnancy loss or perinatal death and cover all pregnancy loss situations from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death. </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress to implement the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. This includes the development of Specialist Bereavement Teams in all 19 maternity hospitals/units, each with a Clinical Midwife Specialist in Bereavement, and the majority of maternity units also now have a specific Bereavement Room. This ensures that families who have experienced a bereavement, get high standard, compassionate care in an appropriate setting, and a setting that affords them privacy and dignity at a very difficult and distressing time.  There are also quiet rooms available in most units to facilitate parents spending time with their baby.  The Department has been assured that all units continue to implement the Standards, and this is closely monitored by the Bereavement Standard Implementation Steering Group which reports to the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the National Standards, a National Maternity Bereavement Experience Survey is being developed by HIQA in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE. The survey will provide an opportunity to consult with women who have dealt with miscarriage and stillbirth. This will be the first national survey asking bereaved parents about their experiences of maternity care in Ireland. The survey will gather bereaved parents&rsquo; lived experiences of maternity care throughout the duration of their pregnancy, hospital admission, postnatal and follow-up care. The findings of this national survey will drive service improvements in maternity care, acknowledging what is working well and identifying areas where improvements are needed.</p>  <p>  This survey is currently under development and was due to begin surveying bereaved parents later in 2021. However, in light of the difficulties posed by the cyber-attack on the HSE&rsquo;s IT systems, the survey has been postponed for a period of 4 months. It is anticipated that surveying of parents will commence in February or March of 2022.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid-19 protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to develop a two-pronged approach to tackle the rise in waiting lists.  Firstly, with the finalisation of a Waiting List Action Plan which will cover the rest of the year, until December 2021. Secondly through the development of a longer-term Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.</p><p>The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p><p>  ">Waiting Lists</p></reply>

My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

The framework was developed in relation to four major chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. </p>  <p>  The Model of Integrated Care for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes recommends screening for diabetes in asymptomatic patients who are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Early identification of patients and initiation of treatment can reduce the development of complications of diabetes.</p>  <p>  Early detection of chronic disease requires clinical suspicion combined with case finding. The Chronic Disease Management Programme, introduced by the 2019 GP GMS Agreement, includes an opportunistic case finding programme to identify eligible patients at high risk of chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, COPD, asthma and/or diabetes). Patients identified as having a chronic disease are included in the structured treatment programme. Patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes are provided with an annual preventive consultation. </p>  <p>  A number of programmes and strategies support diabetes prevention for the wider population, including the Making Every Contact Count Programme through which health professionals encourage patients to make healthier lifestyle choices during routine contacts to help prevent and manage chronic diseases, and Healthy Ireland&rsquo;s A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan which recognises obesity as a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes.</p>  <p>  Other relevant programmes focus on children&rsquo;s health and early intervention, such as the Healthy Ireland Smart Start, the HSE&rsquo;s National Healthy Childhood Programme, and the provision of free GP for all children under six which includes two periodic wellness checks that focus on health and wellbeing and disease prevention. </p></reply>

Ireland does not set the standards for animal welfare in third country markets, which are set by that country's government.</p>  <p>  The Department, however, in cooperation with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. The OIE is the global standard setting body relating to animal health and animal welfare. It is through this forum that we influence standards in other countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a member of the OIE European Platform Steering Committee on Animal Welfare since its creation in 2013 and has offered technical inputs for the development of the OIE Platform action plans. To support these activities, Ireland has also provided financial supports in recent years.  </p>  <p>  All live export shipments from Ireland are conducted in full compliance with legislative requirements. All proposed journeys must be notified to the Regional Veterinary Office in advance, and veterinary certification will only be provided where the journey complies with all animal transport and animal welfare regulations.</p>  <p>  The export of animals is a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry. It plays a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p></reply>

Therefore, from 28th January 2022 antiparasitic veterinary medicines will require a veterinary prescription before they can be supplied.</p>  <p>  All current suppliers of antiparasitic veterinary medicines will continue to be legally permitted to supply these medicines post January 2022. The Department is actively working with all stakeholders to sustain a competitive market for the supply of these products. The ambition is to ensure Irish farmers are empowered to purchase medicines from their supplier of choice. Initiatives such as the development of a National Veterinary Prescribing System (NVPS) will help deliver on this ambition. The NVPS will result in a prescription being made available to a farmer by choice of email or text. Farmers can then engage with Licensed Merchants, veterinary pharmacists or their veterinary practitioner in getting their prescription dispensed.</p></reply>

The CAP Consultative Committee has been meeting for over two years to prepare this plan, together with officials from my Department. A Public Consultation on the draft interventions for the 2023-2027 CAP Strategic Plan took place from 30<sup>th</sup>July to 3<sup>rd</sup>September 2021.  </p><p>I would like to re-iterate my commitment to achieving a better integration between the next CAP Strategic Plan and the new National Forestry Programme, ensuring the measures in both will complement each other. It is the intention of the Government that a new national Forestry Programme, will be put in place for the benefit of farmers, the industry and the overall environment. This new Forestry Programme will be the enabler of the short term goals of the new Forest Strategy which is currently being developed by Working Group 4 of Project Woodland.</p><p>Due to the long-term nature of forestry, it is considered the best option to continue to deliver the forestry programme entirely separately from the CAP Strategic Plan, subject to new State Aid rules rather than the requirements of the CSP regulations. The interlinkages between the CAP Strategic Plan and the new Forestry Programme are well understood. These two significant programmes will provide the mechanisms to deliver for farmers, rural communities and for society as a whole.  </p><p>The planting of trees has the potential to play a significant part in our environmental priorities especially water quality, biodiversity and climate.  Tree planting measures included in the new Agri-Environment Schemes will lead to better integration with our afforestation goals, such as the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme, while the Forestry Programme can provide for the planting of trees in different configurations, including agro forestry. Tree planting of an area greater than 0.1 ha comes under the definition of a forest and is therefore subject to measures in the Forestry Programme. The Department draws in the necessary expertise from across the relevant Divisions, including forestry, in the design of our schemes. </p><p>Throughout the process, there has also been regular engagement between my Department and the various stakeholders in the Agriculture and Forestry Sectors through the CAP Consultative Committee, Project Woodland, the various COFORD working groups and individual sectoral bilateral meetings.</p></reply>

The scheme also pays an annual premium to the landowner of up to &euro;680 per hectare payable each year for 15 years.  I am advised that at present, there is 5,700ha with approval to plant forestry, and I would encourage anyone with a valid approval to contact their Registered Forester to arrange planting.</p>  <p>  In respect of forestry licensing in general, the Department has significantly increased resources with  ecologist numbers gone from one in 2018 to 27 currently and 21 additional forestry inspectors have been deployed.   </p>  <p>  Licensing outputs have increased again in September, with over 500 licences issued (to 24th), the highest in any month this year.  We have now issued more licences year to date than the whole of 2020. We are not there yet but we are making significant progress.  The Department is currently examining every afforestation application in the system and has deployed 10 ecologists to deal specifically with afforestation. </p>  <p>  The Department will shortly announce the successful bidder for the recent tendering process to engage external expertise to carry out an end-to-end regulatory and process review, which has been sought by the Project Woodland working groups.  This is in addition to the systems analyst already in place.  In the meantime, the Department is working with forestry companies to improve the quality of information provided with licence applications.  This has already yielded results for felling licences.  The same exercise has been completed for forest roads and will shortly be carried out on afforestation licence applications.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  The inspection referred to by the Deputy related to work undertaken on a road that was funded through the LIS. The inspection found that the road surface applied by the Local Authority was different from what the applicant understood would be provided. The finish provided by the Local Authority was that outlined in the Local Authority Engineer Inspection Report produced in advance of the works. My Department's inspection also noted that the length of the works undertaken was less than that originally envisaged in the Engineer Inspection Report.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the local authority to determine the appropriate finish on an LIS road, subject to the requirements set out in the LIS scheme outline. Nonetheless, I have asked my officials to contact the Local Authority to highlight the issues raised in the inspection report and to request that they engage directly with the applicant to explore solutions to the concerns raised. </p></reply>
