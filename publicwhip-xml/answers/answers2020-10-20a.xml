    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000075#WRA00900"><p>Ensuring affordability for parents availing of Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare is a priority for my Department.</p><p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department has provided special funding streams to support providers through this difficult time. These funding streams have aimed at minimising the need for providers to raise parental fees in the current circumstances, and some made a fee freeze conditional. </p><p>Some of the supports were additional to the whole-of-Government supports available to all businesses and organisations. </p><p>My Department provided the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme during the required closure period, between April and June. This provided funding towards overhead costs and topping up staff wages. Participating providers agreed that fees could not be charged to parents for that period.</p><p>Following the reopening of services from 29 June, eligible services could continue to avail of the Revenue-operated Wage Subsidy Scheme. My Department provided a COVID-19 Capital Grant, to help services to adhere to the reopening guidelines. </p><p>A Reopening Support Payment was also introduced to support providers in meeting the reopening guidelines necessitated by COVID-19. Recipients of this payment agreed to adhere to the Registered Fees List that had been in place on March 12th for the summer period, to 23 August. </p><p>From September, all registered providers can participate in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. If a provider&rsquo;s viability is still negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, they can apply for the COVID-19 Sustainability Support Fund. Applicants to the Sustainability Fund must adhere to their Registered Fees List for parents/guardians as it was on the 12<sup>th</sup>March 2020. </p><p>All of these financial supports, totalling &euro;180m for 2020, in addition to the existing childcare budget, mean that it should not be necessary for providers to increase fees in order to meet operational costs arising from COVID-19. </p><p>It is important to set the context that all 4,500 childcare services in Ireland are private enterprises and normally set their own fees. However, when they are in receipt of Government funding, it is appropriate that proportionate and reasonable conditions are attached to any scheme. My Department and Pobal investigate cases that arise where a provider may be in breach of scheme requirements.</p></reply>

It is important that Tusla can determine the best ways to meet local needs, within available resources.</p><p>The FRC Programme was established by the then Department of Social and Family Affairs in 1994. Later it transferred to the Family Support Agency, which became part of Tusla on its establishment in 2014. </p><p>The funding for FRCs this year amounted to some &euro;18m.</p><p>I greatly value the work of these Tusla funded services. I recently met with the Family Resource Centre National Forum and heard their concerns and wishes for future resourcing. I am aware of pressures across the community and voluntary sector, which have implications for a number of government departments. </p><p>I intend to work with my cabinet colleagues, and with Tusla, to ensure our key delivery partners are enabled to fully meet the needs of children, young people and their families.</p><p>On 30 September last, I submitted my Performance Framework to Tusla, which will inform its priority focuses for the next three years. My vision for Tusla is for an Agency that equips families and communities to be strong and supportive of children and young people, and promotes their wellbeing. </p><p>I am pleased to have secured additional funding of &euro;61m for Tusla in this year's Budget which, I believe, will help the Agency more fully achieve this vision.  The exact details of where this additional funding is allocated by Tusla will be finalised in the coming weeks, and will form part of my consideration of Tusla&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2021.</p></reply>

These include a literature review, consultations with stakeholders, geographical and census data analysis, consultation with service users and policy analysis. The literature review is now complete.</p>  <p>  In 2020, I am providing &euro;25.3m to Tusla in core funding for DSGBV services. I am also providing additional resources to Tusla to address challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. &euro;800,000 has issued to DSGBV services to date, and I anticipate that &euro;1.2m will be provided by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this crisis, Tusla has actively engaged with services to support a continuity of service, and prioritised DSGBV services as a key service area during COVID-19. We know that COVID-19 restrictions present particular risks to victims of domestic or sexual violence. This can make it more challenging for them to access supports. </p>  <p>  Tusla continues to monitor the situation in refuges with regard to the impact of COVID-19.  According to Tusla, at the end of September, the number of operational refuge spaces was reduced by approximately 53 so that services could operate in line with COVID-19 guidelines.</p>  <p>  Tusla has worked with refuges to identify and secure additional accommodation places where needs have arisen, and is working to bring a number of additional safe houses onstream shortly.  At the end of September, 118 women or families were in refuge services, including off-site units. This also includes 160 children. </p>  <p>  I understand that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be taken into account by Tusla, in its accommodation review. </p>  <p>  Tusla is particularly aware of the need for additional refuge spaces to be self-contained, in line with public health recommendations. The recently developed Modh Eile refuge in Galway City, which opened this year, is a good example of a model that meets these needs. </p></reply>

In addition, low pay and poor working conditions have an impact on the quality of the care provided to children, through their effect on the recruitment, retention and turnover of qualified staff. </p><p>The most recent data available indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019, while staff turnover was 23%.  </p><p>As the State is not the employer, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector.</p><p>My Department is a significant funder of the sector, alongside parents. My Department has, over a number of years, provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p><p>However, wages in the sector remain too low and a solution is required that will most likely need more investment, but also a mechanism to ensure that this investment results in improved pay and conditions.</p><p>I am committed to exploring new ways to impact positively on pay and conditions. In the medium term, the Expert Group on a New Funding Model and the Steering Group of the Workforce Development Plan are both considering future policy tools to support the workforce in early learning and care and school-age childcare services.</p><p>Work on the new funding model is looking at ways in which some services can be funded to meet additional requirements on the quality, affordability and accessibility of services. These could include requirements in relation to wages or working conditions.</p><p>In addition, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to the creation of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector, which could offer a mechanism through which a pay agreement could be achieved in the shorter term. I would urge staff and provider representatives to do their part and urgently consider how this matter can be progressed.</p><p>Since coming into office, I have held a series of meetings with stakeholders in the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector, including ICTU and SIPTU on the employee side, and IBEC and the new trade association Childhood Services Ireland on the employer side.</p><p>The possibility of a Joint Labour Committee is an issue I have discussed in these meetings. In line with the Programme for Government commitment, I intend to continue close engagement with these and other stakeholders with a view to establishing a JLC </p></reply>

I know it has been a long and difficult wait for many but we are now rapidly approaching the point where these matters can be examined by all.</p><p>The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 dictates that the evidence of the Commission be deposited with the prescribed Minister in a sealed form and must remain so for a period of 30 years, pending its transfer to the National Archives.</p><p>The Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020 that I am currently progressing, aims to avail of the opportunity to safeguard an invaluable database so that it is not destroyed or put beyond reach but, rather, can be used to support future information and tracing services.</p><p>The Bill also aims to ensure that the entire Commission archive will be preserved in full so that future generations can benefit further from the important work of the Commission. It is important to note that the majority of the archive is made up of copies of documents received from a number of public bodies such as the HSE, Tusla, Local authorities as well as Diocesan records.</p><p>I recognise that the issue of access to birth and early life information has long been a contentious issue for those who have tried to find the truth of their origins. I am absolutely committed to addressing the wider matter of providing a new architecture surrounding access to birth information and tracing.</p><p>I am aware that interesting proposals have been developed in relation to the potential development of a national archive of institutional abuse at the former Se&aacute;n McDermott Street Laundry.</p><p>While this is a matter worthy of further discussion, I am mindful that it is a complex matter which extends beyond my own Department. It would require detailed consideration and extensive engagement, both with other Government colleagues and Departments, and with a large number of statutory bodies and stakeholder groups.</p><p>I am also conscious that the Government will wish to consider the final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation prior to considering its overall response to issues of this nature.</p><p>However, I do welcome the further engagement with all stakeholders that will undoubtedly happen at a future date in relation to archiving, memorialisation and remembrance.</p></reply>

I will be bringing forward a number of amendments this week, at D&aacute;il Committee stage, in relation to the legitimate expectations of individuals who engaged with the Commission&rsquo;s Confidential Committee module, and to ensure a complete copy of all the records in the archive will be deposited with my Department at the completion of the process.</p><p>I look forward to engaging with members of the House on this important matter. </p><p>The urgent necessity for the Records Bill is to ensure the Commission's database, and related records, are preserved and available to support current and future tracing services. The Bill ensures we protect the opportunities provided by this invaluable digitised and searchable information so we can support its appropriate use now and into the future. </p><p>In addition, the legislation provides that the records to be deposited with my Department are preserved in full as appropriate.</p><p>It must be emphasised that unrestricted use or open public access to the information contained in the database is not being proposed.  Importantly, in bringing forward this Bill, it is not possible to provide a basis for any new entitlement or right of access by individuals to these records. </p><p>Access to personal information held in these records will continue to be regulated by the Adoption Act 2010, GDPR and Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, having regard to the constitutional rights of third parties. </p><p>However, I am absolutely committed to addressing the wider matter of providing a new architecture surrounding access to birth information and tracing and this will be advanced soon. I look forward to engaging widely to allow all those with a stake in this process to have their voices heard.</p></reply>

Unaccompanied minors arriving in the state are taken into the care of Tusla and are allocated a social worker from the Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) team who works with them to ensure that their needs are met. This can include work in relation to asylum, visa or passport applications and extensive family reunification work.    </p></reply>

A Public Services Card (PSC) and verified MyGovID account are required to apply online only.</p>  <p>  The online system offers a user friendly application process for busy parents. It delivers greater efficiency in the administration of a major, national Government scheme. It gives parents the possibility of accessing subsidies via an online automated income assessment.</p>  <p>  A secure identity verification system is required for any such IT system.  The Public Services Card and MyGovID offers this security.  It safeguards applicants' information and the administration of public funding.  Our priority is to provide direct funding to hard-pressed parents and not into administration. An alternative or secondary online identity verification system would be unlikely to deliver the same level of security and would generate additional, unnecessary duplication and expense for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  Parents without a PSC can choose to apply to the NCS via the paper application route.

That same department administers the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). I was gladdened by my colleague, Minister McEntees', recent announcement to bring 50 people in family units from the camp to Ireland in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children, the vast majority of them are aged between 15 and 17 years. My Department and Tusla officials are examining the immediate requirements to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s existing commitments, including expansion of care placements and working with Department of Justice and Equality officials to identify unaccompanied children who wish to come to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to accepting 36 unaccompanied minors and has to date received 8 teenage boys. The young people arrived safely and are settling in well with their new lives. The transfer of this group had been delayed by the COVID-19 public health crisis, and took place in June.</p>  <p>  Tusla is presently working to progress the transfer of four additional young people from Greece, which would form part of the overall commitment to accept 36 young people.</p>  <p>  The state&rsquo;s capacity to bring unaccompanied children to Ireland is determined by the available care placements, and the commitments the state has made to unaccompanied children who are already here. </p>  <p>  Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children and to accelerate their arrival here.  In the Budget allocations last week I secured additional funding to support this aim.  </p>  <p>  Tusla was allocated an additional &euro;61M in Budget 2021. A portion of these additional resources will support Tusla to meet our commitments to transfer additional unaccompanied minors in Greece to Ireland as quickly as possible. I am confident that we will be in a position to fully achieve our existing commitment and the additional resources provided in Budget 2021 will make sure such transfers can take place on a consistent and sustainable basis.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) Team, which has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in international protection programmes, and through caring for unaccompanied minors who arrive unannounced at Irish ports.</p>  <p>  Tusla currently has 59 unaccompanied children in  care, all of whom come from various international protection contexts,  including specific programmes and separated children seeking asylum. In addition at the end of Q1 2020 96 young people, who had previously been unaccompanied children, were in receipt of an aftercare service from Tusla.  Seventy nine were in education or accredited training.</p></reply>

This funding will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide.  My officials and I will, over the coming weeks, be considering how we can best use this funding to ensure that youth services support young people through this very challenging period, with a particular view to their mental wellbeing and their social and employment prospects. </p>  <p>  I am not clear on what the Deputy means by funding anomalies. However, it is important to note that, in addition to funding universal youth services aimed at all young people, my Department funds targeted youth services through the UBU Your Place Your Space scheme. Under this scheme, &euro;38.7million was allocated in 2020, to support young people between the ages of 10 and 24 who are at risk of becoming disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable.</p>  <p>  The scheme is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process. The APNASR Tool supports each Education and Training Board (ETB) to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. The ETB then carries out an analysis of the data to identify the needs of young people in that area.  This results in a Service Requirement for new or existing projects that will be funded by the Department under UBU. The approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidence- informed need.</p>  <p>  It should be noted the ETB is there to support funded youth organisations in implementing the Service Requirement of the area.  The ETB Youth Officer meets regularly with each youth organisation to this end. </p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. In addition, low pay and poor working conditions have an impact on the quality of the care provided through their effect on the recruitment, retention and turnover of qualified staff. The most recent data available indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019, while staff turnover was 23%. This is not good for children, families, staff, providers or the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. However, wages in the sector remain too low and as a significant funder of the sector, alongside parents, it is imperative that my Department works with provider representatives and staff representatives to address the issue.</p>  <p>  I am committed to exploring new ways to impact positively on pay and conditions. In the medium term, the Expert Group on a New Funding Model and the Steering Group of the Workforce Development Plan are both considering future policy tools to support the workforce in early learning and care and school-age childcare services. Work on the new funding model is looking at ways in which some services can be funded to meet additional requirements on the quality, affordability and accessibility of services. These could include requirements in relation to wages or working conditions. In addition, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to the creation of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector, which could offer a mechanism through which a pay agreement could be achieved in the shorter term. </p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is one of many initiatives under First 5.  Others include supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care, and health initiatives. </p>  <p>  Baby Boxes are packages of items and information to assist with the transition to parenthood including safety items, baby clothes, small toys, baby toothbrushes, and books to support early development. The intention is to welcome a new arrival to a family, acknowledging this significant moment for parents. </p>  <p>  The project will pilot and test the design, items for inclusion, registration and distribution of Baby Boxes in a selected geographic area.  An evaluation will inform any plans about wider roll-out. </p>  <p>  Owing to COVID-19, work on this project has been delayed. However, invitations will issue over the coming weeks to key early childhood experts to join an oversight group being established to oversee this development.   </p>  <p>  This Group will finalise the scope of this project and agree a detailed project plan. Key initial considerations will include the identification of the pilot geographic area, agreement on the optimal timing for (pre- or post- natal), and channel of, distribution of the baby box and the likely contents.  A researcher will be appointed to oversee focus groups and/or consultations with new and expectant parents to inform the identification of items for inclusion. </p>  <p>  Following this initial scoping phase, which should conclude by end Q1 2021, the Oversight Group will oversee a competitive procurement process to appoint suitable tenderers to a) develop and distribute the baby boxes and b) undertake a full evaluation of the pilot. Given the likely value of these contracts, the procurement process will take several months and distribution of the baby boxes will commence in end Q3 2021 / early Q4 2021.  </p></reply>

I can confirm that Officials in my Department are presently  engaged with the Department of Justice and  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency on the matter. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to accepting 36 unaccompanied minors and has to date received 8 teenage boys. The young people arrived safely and are settling in well with their new lives. The transfer of this group had been delayed by the COVID-19 public health crisis, and took place in June. Tusla is presently working to progress the transfer of four additional young people from Greece and they are also working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Greek island to identify unaccompanied minors who wish to come to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children and to accelerate their arrival here.   In the Budget allocations last week I secured additional funding to support this aim.  </p>  <p>  Tusla was allocated an additional &euro;61M in Budget 2021. A portion of these additional resources will support Tusla to meet our commitments to transfer additional unaccompanied minors in Greece to Ireland as quickly as possible. I am confident that we will be in a position to fully achieve our existing commitment and the additional resources provided in Budget 2021 will make sure such transfers can take place on a consistent and sustainable basis.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) Team, which has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in international protection programmes, and through caring for unaccompanied minors who arrive unannounced at Irish ports.   </p>  <p>  Tusla currently has 59 unaccompanied children in  care, all of whom come from various international protection contexts,  including specific programmes and separated children seeking asylum. In addition at the end of Q1 2020 96 young people, who had previously been unaccompanied children,  were in receipt of an aftercare service from Tusla.  Seventy nine were in education or accredited training.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the budget also introduced other welcome measures such as the increase in the Qualified Child Allowance by &euro;5 for children over 12 and &euro;2 for children under 12.  The weekly payment for a qualified child aged 12 or over will increase from &euro;40 to &euro;45, while the payment for a child aged under 12 will increase from &euro;36 to &euro;38. These changes represent increases for over 419,000 children in households, which are dependent on social welfare and will take effect from January 2021.</p>  <p>  Other Social Protection measures introduced in Budget 2021 in relation to poverty reduction include:</p>  <p>  - Parental Benefit increasing to 5 weeks for parents of children born or adopted from November 2019 &ndash;an increase of 3 weeks;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;10 increase in the weekly income threshold for Working Family Payment for families with up to three children to help working parents on low incomes; and</p>  <p>  - Working lone parents will no longer lose their One-Parent Family Payment when their employment income exceeds the current &euro;425 limit. This limit of &euro;425 will be removed from April 2021.</p>  <p>  Further supports in education are being provided as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage. This will be supported by additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2021 and &euro;5 million in a full year. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 I have secured extra funding of some &euro;121 million for Tusla, International Protection Seekers Accommodation, and Youth services, bringing the total investment by his Department to over &euro;1.9 billion for 2021. </p>  <p>  The increase of  &euro;61m in funding for Tusla alone will meet increasing demand for existing services including residential care, supporting the community and voluntary sector, services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, and unaccompanied minors. </p>  <p>  The significant additional funding for my Department will be targeted at improving outcomes for children, young people and their families as well as the promotion of equality and human rights.  The funding also provides for the inclusion and integration of persons seeking international protection.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my commitment to ensure that a central focus of the successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures will be on addressing poverty for children and young people. This will be developed in 2021.</p></reply>

My officials are working with Tusla to accelerate the arrival of additional unaccompanied refugee children from the Moria Camp.

Seventy nine were in education or accredited training.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Helen Mc Entee T.D., recently announced an additional commitment under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to welcome up to 50 people in family groups from Greece following the recent fire that almost completely destroyed the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos.  This area of work transferred to my Department on 14 October 2020 and my department will now make the necessary arrangements to receive these families.</p>  <p>  The families who will arrive from Greece have already been granted an international protection status by the Greek authorities. The International Protection Office (IPO) in the Department of Justice will grant them &lsquo;programme refugee&rsquo; status immediately upon their arrival in Ireland. My officials are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements for their safe passage to Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established in 2015 in response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe. Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.   </p>  <p>  To date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under this first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  Most of the remaining people will arrive under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admissions Programme (IHAP). </p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the IRPP was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023, through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship. The refugees who are due to arrive from Greece are in addition to this number.</p></reply>

While the scheme was being developed, preliminary payments were paid in advance to providers to enable them to retain their staff and cover some overhead costs. These preliminary payments were primarily based on pre-covid staffing levels.  It emerged subsequently that such staffing levels were not maintained by some providers and this has resulted in excess funding.</p>  <p>  A letter was issued to providers by Pobal on 16 September informing of their overpayment status and set out how proposed recoupment of the excess funding will take place. </p>  <p>  The TWSCS rules made clear the purposes for which this sector specific funding was intended for.  Excess funding provided  was required to be returned to the Exchequer at the earliest opportunity. Many services will therefore still have the excess amount in their accounts and be in a position to repay it when requested. Some providers have expressed a wish to return the excess funding immediately and structures are in place to facilitate this.   </p>  <p>  My Department, in recognition of pressures the providers are facing in trying to safely reopen  have allowed a  &ldquo;grace&rdquo; period  by delaying the recoupment process until November. This will give providers an opportunity to manage their cashflow requirements in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  and it is not possible from an Exchequer perspective to extend  repayment into another financial year, except of course in exceptional circumstances as discussed below.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some providers may require special or alternative arrangements due to ongoing cashflow difficulties. My Department is prepared to be flexible in supporting providers who may struggle with recoupment and Pobal will be available to work closely with these providers.     </p>  <p>  If a provider continues to experience ongoing viability issues, my Department has recently launched a new Sustainability Fund. This will assist providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) struggling with an imminent threat to the viability of their service arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic.  In the meantime my Department encourages providers seeking further advice and support to contact their City/ County Childcare Committee in the first instance.   </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that in 2020, it is estimated that an additional &euro;180m, above and beyond the childcare budget, will have been invested in the sector. Also, for the first 3 months of 2021 alone, the EWSS will be worth &euro;63m to providers, again on top of their usual Departmental payments. Intensive and very successful efforts have been made by the Department to boost the income of providers in recent years with the 141% increase in investment in the sector. This has enabled services to grow from an average size of 33 places to 47, to access subsidies for twice the number of children as before, to access increased ECCE capitation payments, free CPD for staff, Programme Support Payments worth at least &euro;19m per annum and extra capital investment, for example. </p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to supporting services to provide accessible, affordable and high quality services to children and families.  </p></reply>

The processing of all international protection applications is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  While Tulsa has no role in the asylum system, it has a specialist team of social workers dealing with separated children - the Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) team.  The SCSA team also works with unaccompanied minors that Ireland has agreed to accept under specific projects led by the IRPP.  The SCSA will assist the child in completing a protection application form for the International Protection Office and will also provide emotional support to the child.</p>  <p>  Separated children are the largest cohort of children who come into Tusla care when they present to the immigration authorities at our sea and air ports. The service provided to these children is demand-led, and accurately estimating future demand is challenging as the international situation can change quickly.   These children are received into care and are placed in residential and foster care. </p>  <p>  Tusla's SCSA team received 167 referrals in 2019. Often such referrals include children who arrive unaccompanied at a port of entry but who have an adult relative or friend who lives in Ireland and is willing to care for them. The children who do not have adult relatives or guardians are received into care. There were 46 of these children in 2019.  </p>  <p>  With regard to children who are accompanied by their parents or guardians, such children are included in the protection applications made by their parents.  The International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department (IPAS) has no role in the processing of asylum applications.  IPAS is  responsible for the provision of accommodation and other services to persons who indicate their need for such accommodation during the protection application process.  IPAS has developed a number of policies, including a Child Protection and Welfare Policy and a Domestic and Gender Based Violence Policy.  The implementation of the Child Welfare Policy is overseen by a social work team leader on secondment from Tusla to the Child and Family Services unit of IPAS. This unit provides assistance to centres, develops policies, oversees their implementation and works to ensure that families receive the supports they require while they are being accommodated in our accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  Numerous organisations, including NGOs and State Partners, provide in-reach assistance to the families to assist with their orientation to the country.

Supplies of these should be readily available in services.</p><p>The HPSC has advised that services should keep a small supply of surgical masks in a readily accessible place for use by a staff member who develops symptoms of COVID-19, or by staff members caring for a sick child who is waiting to be collected by a parent.</p><p>The guidance provides the following clarification on the use of face coverings in a childcare setting: </p><p>&ldquo;The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommends the use of cloth face coverings in certain indoor settings. This guidance is applicable to adults in childcare settings where it does not pose a barrier to care. This includes situations where there is interaction between adults when not caring for children. </p><p>If a childcare worker wishes to use a face covering but this may pose a barrier to care, they may consider use of a visor. Visors should extend from above the eyes to below the chin and from ear to ear.&rdquo;</p><p>Responsibility for accessing supplies of PPE for safe operation of services is a matter for the individual service provider. The cost and sourcing of PPE was raised as an issue by provider representatives at meetings of the Department's Advisory Group on Reopening during Covid. In order to assist services with reopening, the Department has put financial supports in place, including a once-off reopening grant, and access to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme which covers approximately 38% of  services' operating costs, in addition to Departmental schemes and parental income.  </p><p>These measures are being very effective is assisting providers with their operating costs. </p></reply>

The Department makes every possible effort to be flexible with providers participating in theses schemes. DCYA does this through its scheme administrator, Pobal.   </p>  <p>  In the case of the National Childcare Scheme, providers do not have to make up for closed days. The provider can select up to 10 days (in addition to bank holidays) that they can close for across the year and still be paid. The provider does not need to give a reason for these closures.</p>  <p>  For ECCE, to ensure children benefit from the full 38 week provision of care and education, DCYA allows services to close temporarily where this is required, once it is notified to Pobal. Full payment continues in these cases, but the provider must make up the days at another time during the academic year, for example, by adding an extra day at the end of term, or during a mid&ndash;term break.</p>  <p>  Providers have found this level of flexibility to be reasonable in the past allowing them to respond to any emergencies that may arise and it also ensures that children (or their parents) do not lose out on their entitlement. </p>  <p>  Finally,  it is important to note that while providing a crucial service, childcare providers and their staff are not employees of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.   As such the Department is not responsible for the leave arrangements of childcare providers, whether leave is required on compassionate, bereavement or any other grounds.  </p></reply>

An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. Government has made available &euro;50 million in funding to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on this group was included in Budget 2021. My officials and I are developing proposals for the utilisation of this funding for submission to Government prior to commencement. </p>  <p>  This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education.  The future development of Ireland as an inclusive society and a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.   </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options including the existing student contribution and other supports.  </p>  <p>  Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future funding which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability. </p>  <p>  All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of the Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further education. </p></reply>

This classification continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p>  <p>  Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student when they progress from further education to higher education or if they are returning as a "second chance" student after a five year break in studies. This is intended as an access measure for mature students. </p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. Relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I recently announced plans to review the SUSI scheme.  It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020, and will report in Summer 2021.  Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process, and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review. </p>  <p>  The existing rules reflect the fact that very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents, where their parents have sufficient means, while in full-time education. Therefore, any proposed changes would need careful consideration. The forthcoming Review of the SUSI scheme provides a suitable means to do so.</p></reply>

My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  I understand, based on the information available to me, that a number of universities are offering flexible accommodation options to students this year, in response to the move to blended learning. Short term on-campus accommodation is available in several universities, and students should contact their institution directly to see what options are available to them.</p>  <p>  I would hope that private student accommodation providers will recognise the evolving accommodation needs of students this year and respond accordingly, however no powers are available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action. </p>  <p>  In relation to flexibility around existing tenancy or license agreements, the terms of the lease or license should be set out in an agreement signed by both parties at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage directly with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached.</p>  <p>  If no satisfactory solution can be reached with their provider, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to continue to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to continue to assess the situation and to monitor and report to me on developments on this issue in order to ascertain whether any further policy response is feasible.  </p></reply>

As of the end of Round Two, more than 49,000 students have accepted a place. There is no indication that a higher number of students than usual are opting to defer their place to the 2021 academic year, and given the large numbers of students who have been accommodated in higher education this year it is feasible that the numbers of students reapplying to the CAO next year on the basis of Leaving Certificate results from prior years will be lower in 2021 than previously. </p>  <p>  &euro;18 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places from September 2021.  This increase will address demographic growth pressures and equates to an overall investment of nearly &euro;80 million to address the demographic increases since 2018. These places are in addition to the 1,330 additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  My Department will monitor the situation as it develops and take action as necessary to ensure the availability of a full range of further and higher education options for the class of 2021.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has been made in the 2020/2021 academic year on the necessary increase in third level places to meet current and projected demographic demand, and Budget 2021 will greatly facilitate us in continuing this progress in the next academic year. </p></reply>

As part of Budget 2021, I have secured an additional &euro;20 million to provide for additional applicants, &euro;6 million to expand supports to postgraduate students and an additional &euro;1.5 million to support the most disadvantaged students through the 1916 Bursary scheme.  I have also secured a &euro;50 million fund to support full-time students in third level this year.  </p>  <p>  This is on top of a range of additional supports which have been provided to reflect the particular circumstances of learners affected by the pandemic, including  an additional &euro;10m for access supports services, &euro;15m in IT equipment grants and &euro;3m for wellbeing and mental health.</p>  <p>  There is an immediate challenge which we must meet in responding to the changed economic circumstances. During the course of 2020, SUSI has experienced an increase in the number of applications for grant assistance as well as the number of students seeking a review based on the change of circumstances provision in the scheme. This is primarily due to the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on tenure of employment and income levels.  To date there has been an increase of 4% in the number of applications received by SUSI in comparison to this time last year. It is estimated that SUSI will receive over 100,000 applications for the 2020/21 academic year compared to 96,094 for the 2019/20 academic year. </p>  <p>I want to look strategically at the wide range of issues related to the SUSI scheme, and that is why I recently announced plans to review the scheme. It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020, and will report in Summer 2021. Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process. The amount allocated to SUSI in any given year will continue to depend on the annual Estimates cycle, but it is my intention that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review.    </p></reply>

For the education providers under the remit of my Department, the allocation includes funding towards immediate ICT costs relating to the move to online provision for staff and students.</p><p>My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions. The additional funding allocation has been assessed by the HEA and a final breakdown and distribution of funding allocation for the costs incurred is being finalised and correspondence is now being issued to all eligible providers. </p><p>As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of the allocated funding, including any expenditure in relation to area raised by the Deputy in his question, is a matter for the individual institutions.  The institutions are best placed to make decisions on the nature of ICT provision to particular staff based upon the work they do and supports required. </p><p>Through Budget 2021 an additional &euro;15million is being provided for the Devolved Capital Grant to higher education institutions for the academic year 2020/21.  This recognises the significant adjustments that the sector has had to make to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Some examples of how the funding may be used include:</p><p>- ICT-related capital investments to support blended and online learning</p><p>- Equipment procurement to support learning and research</p><p>- Minor building upgrades or health and safety-related works</p><p>- Building improvements that support access for all</p><p>- Capital investments that advance sustainability and decarbonisation goals</p><p>This funding is in addition to &euro;25 million for the Devolved Capital Grant announced in August &ndash; the first time in nearly a decade that this flexible capital funding had been extended to the university sector.</p><p>I will continue to work with further and higher education providers, agencies and key stakeholders including staff representatives to mitigate the additional pressures faced as a result of Covid-19 and the very significant additional resources provided to the sector, which are available to support the effort.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the SUSI scheme contains provisions which allow this payment to be recognised for the purposes of meeting the eligibility criteria for the special rate of grant, which is the highest maintenance grant support available.  Over 5,000 students qualified for the special rate in the last academic year by virtue of their family having a family income supplement.</p>  <p>  This treatment, along with other provisions of the scheme, ensures that those students most in need receive supports commensurate with their needs. </p>  <p>  I also think it is important for students to be aware of  the other supports available to them, particularly the Student Assistance Fund which assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

Section 38 of the 2018 Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. </p>  <p>  As autonomous higher education institutes established under statute, it remains a matter for the governing body of an IoT to set the institute&rsquo;s particular strategic direction within the higher education landscape, including whether or not to seek TU designation through the prescribed legal processes.</p>  <p>  In June 2020, Dundalk Institute of Technology launched a new three-year strategic plan in which the Institute articulates a mission to be a leader for higher education and craft apprenticeships, and the engine for growth and social cohesion in North Leinster-South Ulster through the achievement of TU status and strengthened cross-border alliances. </p>  <p>  The Department understands that the Institute has explored with a number of TU development consortia and with TU Dublin the potential for mergers under the relevant legislative framework.</p>  <p>  On 7 October 2020, together with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), I announced the first funding allocations under the new TU Transformation Fund. Total funding allocated amounted to &euro;34.33 million.  Dundalk IT was invited to make a submission under the fund given its stated commitment to becoming a TU and was allocated &euro;0.76m. The HEA has indicated its willingness to work with and support the Institute to facilitate a process placing it on a trajectory to achieve TU status. This includes the services of a HEA advisor on higher education policy to assist the Institute as an external advisor going forward.  </p></reply>

All provision will be reviewed by SOLAS with the broader FET sector in this context.</p>  <p>  Strategic performance agreements between SOLAS and the ETBs set out the parameters and the current targets and deliverables for 2018-2020.

The aim of this new strategy will be to ensure that everyone has the literacy, numeracy and digital skills to meet their needs and participate fully in society. </p>  <p>  This new strategy will provide a framework to build on and streamline the substantial work that is already being done across a range of Departments and agencies, to increase awareness of services for the public and to capture the contribution that can be made right across Government to deliver better literacy, numeracy and digital skills in the adult population. I would also like the framework being provided through this new strategy to be a tool that can be used to embed the use of literacy friendly provision and plain language to ensure the most accessible public, civil and business services throughout the country.</p>  <p>  To support a whole-of-government approach, I have established an interdepartmental stakeholder group on literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. This group is made up of Government Departments, Government agencies and stakeholder groups with keys roles in the areas of adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. </p>  <p>  I chaired the first meeting of this group last Thursday. The meeting was really positive and was attended by representatives from the public service, civil service, business and NGOs.  SOLAS will shortly be initiating a public consultation process on the key themes for the strategy and representatives are assisting in finalising a paper and ensuring the consultation gets the widest engagement possible.  I intend to bring the completed strategy to Government in the Spring.</p></reply>

An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. Government has made available &euro;50 million in funding to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on this group was included in Budget 2021. My officials and I are developing proposals for the utilisation of this funding for submission to Government prior to commencement. </p>  <p>  This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education.  The future development of Ireland as an inclusive society and a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.   </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options including the existing student contribution and other supports.  </p>  <p>  Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future funding which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability. </p>  <p>  All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of the Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further education. </p></reply>

This unique three-pillar approach was developed in close consultation with agencies, stakeholders, provider representative bodies and social partners.</p>  <p>  These guides have since been supplemented by Implementation Guidelines developed by experts within the higher education sector, and approved by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, published on August 5th.  These guidelines can be further updated and modified as the public health situation evolves.</p>  <p>  On 25th September intensified protective measures in third level were announced, in line with public health advice. On-site activity in further and higher education will be reduced so long as these measures are in place. Campuses will remain open to facilitate learners and researchers attendance for laboratory, practical and apprenticeship training, scheduled library attendance and small group activity on a prioritised basis. </p>  <p>  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures are very important from a public health perspective in controlling the spread of the Coronavirus.  </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous with regard to their administrative and academic affairs, and the way in which blended learning will be implemented will vary between institutions and programmes, and will change in line with the changing public health situation. It is not intended for a 'one size fits all' approach to be followed as the diversity and flexibility of the higher education sector has been key in driving responsive and adaptable approaches to the challenges created by the pandemic. The guidance that has been provided is designed to allow higher education institutions to leverage that flexibility to adapt to a evolving situation, and change their approach in accordance with the latest health advice.</p></reply>

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students can apply for supports under the Student Assistance Fund. The fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website </p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

The SFI Public Service Fellowship, which was launched in 2019, offers researchers a unique opportunity to be seconded to Government Departments, Agencies and the Oireachtas Library and Research Services, to work on specific research projects. The Fellowships awarded will foster innovation within the Public Sector by supporting the development and implementation of data-driven and evidence-based approaches. </p>  <p>  The projects offered by the hosts include a wide range of topics &ndash; including the economic, social and ethical implications of technological innovation; data analytics for signals of emerging food safety risks;  the economic cost of discrimination and the benefits of diversity in the workplace, to name a few. Projects are due to commence in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic it became very clear to me the essential input, expertise and service that the academic research community can provide to bolster colleagues in Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  Equally, placements within Government Departments and Agencies will expose academic researchers to the mechanics of public service and policy making which will contribute greatly to their career development.  The secondment model will also provide an opportunity for further dissemination of knowledge and learnings to a broader academic cohort on return of the Fellow to their academic institution.   Thus, the Public Service Fellowship pilot programme will help in increasing the linkages between the research and civil service systems.</p></reply>

In recent years the Irish Research Council (IRC) and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) have launched a number of initiatives to bring researchers closer to Government. </p>  <p>  In July 2018 the IRC launched its Oireachtas Shadowing Scheme. The scheme sees some of Ireland&rsquo;s most prominent researchers &lsquo;shadowing&rsquo; members of the Oireachtas for the day in Leinster House. The scheme was developed by the IRC to bridge the divide between policy-making and research and to ensure that elected representatives are supported to tap into publicly funded research. The scheme pairs an IRC funded researcher with a member of the Oireachtas. The scheme is an excellent opportunity for researchers to deepen their understanding of political engagement and the policy-making system and for members of the Oireachtas to engage directly with publicly funded researchers. I would encourage my colleagues in the Oireachtas to contact the Council and take advantage of this opportunity.</p>  <p>  SFI places a particular priority on creating opportunities for the Houses of the Oireachtas staff and members to engage with SFI funded researchers over the past number of years. Many of these engagements have been arranged in close partnership with the Oireachtas and Library Research Services. The Oireachtas LRS is now a formal partner with SFI through the SFI Public Service Fellowship (launched in 2019) which will see academic researchers placed within the Oireachtas LRS (and other Government Departments) teams working side by side with colleagues there on critical areas such as climate change and the economic, social and ethical implications of technological innovation.</p>  <p>  There have also been targeted talks by researchers, and science week events. In addition, SFI has also brought Oireachtas Committees on site visits to their research centres so that they can see, first hand, the research that is taking place in Ireland which is of relevance to the work of their Committees. </p>  <p>  Both SFI and the IRC are creating engagement opportunities through a range of formats, and these engagements are created to expose members and staff of the Oireachtas to the excellent and impactful work research that is being carried out by academics and to create opportunities for dialogue and relationship building with that community. </p>  <p>  Public and Government outreach by our scientists is more important than ever in the context of COVID-19, and my Department, in consultation with all other relevant Government departments and agencies, will consider how best to further engage publicly funded researchers in the wider context as part of the development of the next national strategy for research and innovation.</p></reply>

This will provide up to 500 places on new specialist retrofitting training courses targeted towards unemployed persons.  In the region of 400 additional places will also be provided to allow for the expansion of existing programmes targeted to the upskilling of persons already in employment &ndash; bringing the total number of learners in retrofit specific programmes to over 1,500 per annum.  </p>  <p>  The Regional Skills Fora are working with enterprise and education providers in their regions to identify and address the skills needed to transition to the green economy.  For example, the Midlands and Mid East Regional Skills Fora continue to work with the Just Transitions team in their region in order to ensure a range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities to enable the workforce to meet the needs of the green economy.</p>  <p>  As in other sectors, the upgrade and retrofit of the building stock to meet decarbonisation targets will be an important part of the overall climate response. In the higher education sector, my Department is co-funding an Energy Efficiency and Decarbonisation Pathfinder Programme with SEAI.  This initiative, which comprises eight projects and involves total Exchequer investment of &euro;5.9 million, will test and demonstrate retrofit approaches, inform key stakeholders and provide an evidence base for larger scale investments in the future.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also convened a technical steering group to support the development of a decarbonisation pathways report for the higher education sector.  This report, which will include a practical tool to be deployed by the higher education sector in assessing different retrofit approaches, is expected to be finalised this year.    </p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland continues to invest in research which underpins our ambitions for reductions in emissions.  These multiannual investments will see new advancements in science, technology and innovation in 2021 and beyond, and will continue to attract industry and international partnerships. Examples of existing investments include large scale world leading SFI Research Centres such as MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine and BiOrbic, the SFI Bioeconomy Research Centre.</p>  <p>  In addition to the existing investments, SFI will launch new calls for research proposals under its programmes &ndash; such as the Frontiers for the Future Programme &ndash; that support excellent research, foster diverse top talent and fund research that produces tangible benefits.  </p>  <p>  New opportunities for all island cooperation in the area of climate action is a priority for SFI in 2021. The agency will also continue its important work on citizen and community engagement, with an increased focus on creating opportunities for dialogue and conversation with the people of Ireland on what the future looks like for them and the role of science and innovation in creating that future.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, work is underway in my Department to develop the successor strategy to Innovation 2020, Ireland's strategy for research and development, science and technology. I expect the strategy to set out a vision that will ensure we prioritise investing in RDI as key to addressing our economic and social challenges, including the challenge of climate change.</p></reply>

In this regard earlier this year, I secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. </p>  <p>  This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and re-opening of our higher education institutions. This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc. </p>  <p>  I understand that many institutions are already in the process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, and more to follow suit over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority, assisted by a broad range of stakeholders, including the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, USI, Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland, and my Department prepared a National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which was published on 10 October 2020. The Framework recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling will allow for development of active outreach to students, and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.   </p>  <p>  In recent weeks I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution's keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students.  Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. The 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required. </p></reply>

On-site activity in further and higher education will be reduced so long as these measures are in place. Campuses will remain open to facilitate learners and researchers attendance for laboratory, practical and apprenticeship training, scheduled library attendance and small group activity on a prioritised basis. </p>  <p>  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures are very important from a public health perspective in controlling the spread of the Coronavirus. </p>  <p>  Responding to these issues is a significant matter of concern for myself and for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we are examining how accommodation providers can be encouraged to show greater flexibility to students during this challenging time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector is already engaging with these issues. As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, five of the seven universities have confirmed that students who do not wish to proceed with their booking in university-owned student accommodation can cancel it without charge, and those who opt to leave their accommodation will receive refunds. I am awaiting confirmation of the policies in the remaining two - Trinity College and DCU. I am aware that DCU has adopted a flexible model where students can book and pay for accommodation for a number of days and nights, rather than the full semester. I also understand at DCU where a student paid a deposit but chose not to take up the accommodation they will have the deposit refunded in full. I will be continuing to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation.  </p>  <p>  For students in the private rental market, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances in which students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to continue to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to monitor and report to me on developments on student accommodation issues in order to ascertain whether any further policy response is feasible.  </p></reply>

There are a number of processes in place to support this, underpinned by statute under the Industrial Training Act 1967 and the Quality Assurance and Qualifications Act 2012, including: </p>  <p>  - &lsquo;The Apprenticeship Code of Practice&rsquo;, published by SOLAS, covers the key obligations of employers and apprentices participating in apprenticeship.  Employers are required to sign up to this code prior to engaging apprentices.  Companies seeking to recruit apprentices are also required to undertake the SOLAS &lsquo;Suitability to Train Assessment&rsquo; prior to being admitted onto the register of approved employers. </p>  <p>  - The network of Authorised Officers (AOs) of the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), working on behalf of SOLAS, continually engage with employers and individual apprentices throughout their apprenticeship programme, ensuring adherence to the Code of Practice as well as providing ongoing supports. </p>  <p>  - All SOLAS approved training organisations and tutors are subject to independent scheduled process monitoring and/or unscheduled assessment event monitoring to ensure adherence with both Quality Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accreditation and SOLAS requirements. </p>  <p>  - A comprehensive quality assurance process for apprenticeships covers the quality of delivery on and off the job training and is overseen by QQI through co-ordinating providers. </p></reply>

As of the end of Round Two, more than 49,000 students have accepted a place. There is no indication that a higher number of students than usual are opting to defer their place to the 2021 academic year, and given the large numbers of students who have been accommodated in higher education this year it is feasible that the numbers of students reapplying to the CAO next year on the basis of Leaving Certificate results from prior years will be lower in 2021 than previously. </p>  <p>  &euro;18 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places from September 2021.  This increase will address demographic growth pressures and equates to an overall investment of nearly &euro;80 million to address the demographic increases since 2018. These places are in addition to the 1,330 additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has been made in the 2020/2021 academic year on the necessary increase in third level places to meet current and projected demographic demand, and Budget 2021 will greatly facilitate us in continuing this progress in the 2021/2022 academic year.</p>  <p>  However, CAO points will nonetheless fluctuate next year as they do every year. Changes in CAO points depend on the volume of applications, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland. Given this uncertainty, it is impossible to predict what the impact will be on CAO points for 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department will monitor the situation as it develops and take action as necessary to ensure the availability of a full range of further and higher education options for the class of 2021.</p></reply>

One of the ways effect is given to this independence is that funding for the Director&rsquo;s Office is provided through a separate Vote; Vote 5 &ndash; Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  While I have a role in presenting Estimates for the DPP&rsquo;s Vote to the Oireachtas annually, neither I nor my officials exercise any control in relation to how the Director discharges her functions. </p>  <p>  I understand that in 2019 the Director of Public Prosecutions proposed to create a Specialised Sexual Offences Unit within her Office as  work being undertaken in Ireland, and the experience of neighbouring jurisdictions, pointed to better outcomes being delivered for victims when sexual offences are dealt with by the prosecution service in specialised sexual offences units.  The Director recognised that a dedicated unit would produce better outcomes for victims, and that it would involve additional costs. </p>  <p>  The Director&rsquo;s officials engaged in discussions with officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to the additional funding required.  The cost of the 10 additional staff sought by the Director to create the unit was &euro;800,000 a year.  It was agreed to provide funding for these additional staff in two phases.  &euro;300,000 was provided in the 2020 Estimates to enable the unit to be established and a commitment was given that the remaining funding of &euro;500,000  be provided in the 2021 Estimates.  I can confirm for the Deputy that in the 2021 Estimates for the DPP&rsquo;s Office, published recently, the additional &euro;500,00 committed to in 2019 has been provided.  Therefore, the 2021 Estimates for the DPP&rsquo;s Office contains provision of &euro;800,000 to fully meet the salary costs of the 10 additional staff sought by the Director for the Sexual Offences Unit.</p></reply>

In order to reduce transmission of this disease quickly we are making this decision now so we can return to a lower level of the Living with Covid-19 framework. </p><p>Budget 2021 provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. </p><p>The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Restart Grant Plus, cash for businesses, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers.</p><p>As a result of the fact that businesses have to close, we are making changes to the PUP and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.</p><p>The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, the New Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), is now operational through Revenue and offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>On 28<sup>th</sup>August 2020, the Government announced a further &euro;16m support package to help pubs, bars and nightclubs, recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on their businesses and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening. This package contained measures including:</p><p>- Restart Grant Plus 40% Top Up: Those businesses remaining closed and planning their re-opening can now receive a minimum of &euro;5,600 and a maximum of &euro;35,000 under the Restart Grant Plus. This can be used to help additional expense and adaptations associated with re-opening when the time comes.</p><p>- Waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020.</p><p>- Waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p><p>The Restart Grant Plus provides direct grant aid to businesses with up to 250 employees to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. Top-ups were previously made available for eligible businesses in Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Dublin and Donegal in respect of a further period of restrictions, for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs nationwide that re-opened on 21 September, and for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs in Dublin that remain closed. </p><p>Businesses in Dublin and Donegal were generally eligible for a grant top-up due to the restrictions imposed at that time. Donegal pubs remained partially open, so the pubs were entitled to an additional top-up in recognition of the restrictions imposed. Meanwhile, Dublin pubs that were forced to remain closed were entitled to a further enhanced top-up.</p><p>These supports are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives. Further information on top-up payments and application forms for the Restart Grant Plus Scheme are available on the websites of all Local Authorities. The closing date for receipt of applications to the scheme has been extended to 31<sup>st</sup>October 2020 to ensure the scheme is accessible to as many businesses as possible.</p></reply>

In Budgets 2012 and 2013, the Government first reduced and then abolished the rebate payment.  The rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, and ongoing commitment to the Irish economy, thus benefiting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. At the time the rebate was ceased, Ireland was the only OECD country that offered a rebate mechanism for viable businesses with payments made of approximately &euro;300m each year.  At the time, it was not deemed a targeted use of the resources of the social insurance fund.    </p>  <p>  In situations where an employer cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments due to financial difficulties, the Department of Social Protection can make the statutory redundancy payment to eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund on behalf of the employer. When such a redundancy payment is made, a debt is raised against the employer. The Department will engage with employers to establish their financial situation on a case by case basis and will seek to recover the debt on a mutually agreed basis.    </p>  <p>  The Redundancy Payments Scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments.  The Scheme takes into account both an employer&rsquo;s ability to pay and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer&rsquo;s financial position improves.     </p>  <p>  Since March, the Government has put in place a major expansion of targeted measures in response to the Covid-19 crisis which will provide employers with the security of continued support for the rest of this year and well into 2021. Budget 2021 will help companies deal with both Brexit and Covid-19 and provides for additional significant measures tailored to those sectors who are most in need, thereby sustaining jobs. This week the EWSS was enhanced and aligned with PUP rates with the intention of retaining the link between employee and employer.</p></reply>

The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science launched a consultation process to help develop this new Action Plan in early August.</p>  <p>  While this future vision for apprenticeships is being developed, and in the shorter term, the July Jobs Stimulus included provision for the introduction of an Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme for employers of apprentices across all sectors. This is in recognition of the Government's commitment to the value of apprenticeships and their continued expansion, as well as an acknowledgement of the real financial difficulties faced by employers in these challenging times. </p>  <p>  The scheme provides a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice registered between the 1st March and 31st December of this year, and it has been extended under the recent Budget into 2021. Further details are available from SOLAS or through www.apprenticehsip.ie. </p>  <p>  I would encourage the Deputy to contact the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Apprenticeship Council if she has further queries. Operational responsibility in this area lies with SOLAS, Ireland's further education and training authority.</p></reply>

The inspector grades comprise of Grade I (senior inspectors) as well as GII and GIII inspectors. Inspectors operate across all mandates of the Health and Safety Authority including occupational health and safety and market surveillance of products and chemicals. </p>  <p>  At the end of August 2020, the Health and Safety Authority employed 181 staff, including inspectors, professional and technical specialists, administrators and clerical staff. Of the 181 staff, 109 are employed in inspector grades with 67 of these inspectors available for field work in relation to checking compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. </p>  <p>  The Authority has not hired new inspectors in the period since July 2020 to date.  However, the Health and Safety Authority inspectorate is being supplemented significantly by deploying other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities to carry out Protocol compliance checks. These resources are drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the cohort of Environmental Health Officers, the Department of Education as well as the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency. This has resulted in up to an additional 700 inspectors checking compliance with the Protocol as part of their normal inspection programme. </p>  <p>  The 2021 funding being made available to the Health and Safety Authority will enable the Authority to assist businesses to comply with workplace health and safety obligations as well as assisting businesses to plan for a changed regulatory landscape post-Brexit especially in relation to chemical usage, product safety, market surveillance and accreditation. </p>  <p>  The additional Budget allocation of &euro;4m to the Health and Safety Authority is primarily an additional pay allocation to increase the staff available to the Authority, including the recruitment of additional inspectors, to deliver on its mandate. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority will use the additional funding to establish a new Occupational Health Division that will initially support occupational health responses to COVID-19.

The results of this were used to inform the process by which key infrastructure operators were designated as Operators of Essential Services under the NIS Directive, in 2018. Since that time, these Operators have been bound to meet a set of cyber security requirements, and to report incidents to the NCSC. The NCSC also audits these entities against compliance with their requirements under European and National law.   </p>  <p>  The 2019 National Cyber Security Strategy included a commitment to conduct a further risk assessment of critical infrastructure in the State.

As part of this programme of work, and on foot of a specific commitment in the Programme for Government, the ESRI published a report, 'Carbon taxes, poverty and compensation options,' on 13 October. The report identified a series of targeted direct social protection payment interventions and examined the effect of each on the incomes of lower income families.    In addition to raising the level of carbon tax by &euro;7.50 per tonne, the Government has committed, in Budget 2021, to significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports. These supports were selected to address the impact of the increased carbon tax, as identified by the ESRI. The specific measures are:</p>  <p>  - an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12, and &euro;5 per week for children over 12; </p>  <p>  - an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;5 per week; and </p>  <p>  - an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;3.50 per week.</p>  <p>  The total cost of these interventions is expected to reach an estimated &euro;153.5m in 2021. This will be part-funded by receipts from the increased carbon tax of &euro;48m, with the remaining &euro;105.5m cost to be funded by general Exchequer receipts.</p>  <p>  Further information on these is measures is available on www.budget.gov.ie. </p></reply>

This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. The European Commission has just presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. Parliament and Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the enhanced ambition at EU level to increase the EU 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reduction as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s EU 2030 Climate Target Plan, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. To this end, Ireland is one of 12 countries who have signed a joint statement ahead of the European Council in October on strengthening EU climate ambition and agreeing on increasing the 2030 climate target to &ldquo;at least 55 percent&rdquo; this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out significant increased climate ambition for Ireland, committing to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 and to achieving net zero to emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with the EU 2050 ambition. The next iteration of the Climate Action Plan will set out, on an economy-wide basis, how the 2030 ambition in the Programme for Government might be achieved. A subset of that Plan will ultimately deal with Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU 2030 target and any increased ambition in a revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the framework which sets Member States&rsquo; emissions reduction targets for 2030.</p>  <p>  In addition, the purpose of the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill which is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny is to strengthen the governance structure in supporting Ireland's response to climate breakdown. The Bill will:</p>  <p>  - Set the 2050 decarbonisation target in law.</p>  <p>  - Provide for the adoption of five-year carbon budgets, setting maximum emissions by sector.</p>  <p>  - Strengthen the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, including in relation to proposing appropriate carbon budgets.</p></reply>

The report provides modelled emission pathways consistent with the 1.5&deg;C goal. While the global carbon budget is focused on CO2 as the main driver of global warming, the report also enhanced understanding of the required emission reduction pathways for other major greenhouse gases. In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C with limited or no overshoot, the report shows CO2 emissions reduced to net zero by 2050. However, this report also points out that non-CO2 emissions, including methane, while being reduced, will not reach net zero globally. </p>  <p>  Thus, the scientific consensus is clear, we must reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 to ensure we protect our planet and our country from the most severe impacts of global warming. This Government is committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. A key aspect of delivering upon this commitment will be enacting a 2050 target in law through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020. The Bill also defines how five-year carbon budgets will be set, including sectoral decarbonisation target ranges, ensuring  every sector must contribute towards meeting this target through agreed policies, actions and measures. </p>  <p>  The development of appropriate carbon budgets for Ireland will be informed by science and the expert advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council who will propose carbon budgets to the Minister. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides that any plans or strategies to achieve the carbon budgets and 2050 target will acknowledge the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  While, as acknowledged, it is not necessary for biogenic methane emissions to reach net zero, nor would this be an attainable goal, the agricultural sector has an important role to play in reducing emissions as far as is technologically possible, and to contribute to carbon sequestration and fossil fuel displacement. Land use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and constitutes an opportunity both for farmers and for rural areas. This potential will be fully explored to curb the emissions, as well as to create jobs and diversify farmers&rsquo; income. The Government will evaluate the potential for contributions towards our climate ambition from land-use improvements, and set in train the development of a land-use plan based on its findings.</p></reply>

As of 13 October, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 24 counties and steady progress is being made with over 103,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. In County Kildare, surveys have been completed in areas including Naas, Johnstown and Kill.This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (). </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 13 October 2020, some 164 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 51 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at . </p><p>BCPs locations due for installation in Kildare include Backgate Lodge, Kilkee Demesne, Castledermot and Crookstown Further Education and Training Centre. BCPs installed and waiting connectivity include Lullymore Heritage Park and Bigstone Community Hall.  </p><p>In addition some schools will be provided with high speed broadband through the BCP Programme, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. A number of schools in Kildare including Saint David&rsquo;s National School, Killashee, Naas and Rathmore National School, Rathmore West, Naas will be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative. My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 13 October 2020, some 164 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 51 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition some schools will be provided with high speed broadband for educational access only through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education and Skills.  My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. </p><p>Further details can be found at .</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. </p><p>This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The Board has been established in line with Regulation 16 of Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents, Serious Incidents and Incidents) Regulations 2009 and I have appointed Senior Counsel Patrick McCann as the Chairperson and sole member of the Review Board.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the 2009 Regulations, the Review Board is entirely independent in its work and the timeframe for the Board to carry out the re-examination is a matter for the Chairperson to determine.</p></reply>

In addition to this, due to the social distancing requirements, normal daily capacity is considerably reduced. This means that customers will experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended. The public&rsquo;s patience and understanding in this regard is requested. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Priority then will be given in order of application date.  While there is some capacity for urgent test slots, the Road Safety Authority (RSA)'s capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. Therefore, initially those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government in 2021. This will involve identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. My officials have commenced work on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration when legislating.</p>  <p>  As for the approach of localised "trials",  the legal framework in Ireland does not allow for such approaches here without undermining the overall legal framework that protects road users.  I would note that such localised trials have not consistently been either successful or useful, particularly in jurisdictions with similar legal frameworks. It is important that we observe the overall outcomes and not just selected samples when we learn from international experience.</p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters, whether privately owned or rented as part of a sharing scheme, will remain illegal. Therefore it would not be prudent to allow sharing schemes at this point in time.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the exposure to airports as a result of the dramatic downturn in activity and I can assure the Deputy that officials in my Department have been in regular contact with the airports throughout this crisis.</p>  <p>  This year, funding for Ireland's smallest regional airports has been maintained through the Government's Regional Airports Programme.  To date, Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock) have been allocated capital supports of almost &euro;2.5 million.  In recent weeks, the Department has also issued invitations to these airports to apply for funding under an operational grant scheme with an available budget in 2020 of close to &euro;3.5 million.  Donegal and Kerry airports are also benefitting from annual support of more than &euro;7 million for the PSO air services between these airports and Dublin.    </p>  <p>  Regional connectivity and development remains a critical priority of this Government and that is evident from the level of support being provided in 2021 &ndash; more than &euro;31 million.  </p>  <p>  Despite the unprecedented demands on the Exchequer, I have secured the continuation of vital Exchequer supports for the Regional Airports Programme next year.  &euro;21.3 million is being provided in 2021 to support capital and operational aid in the areas of safety and security as well as ongoing funding support for the PSO air services.  This funding will be administered through a new Regional Airports Programme for the period 2021 to 2025.  </p>  <p>  By virtue of their size, Shannon and Cork airports have never been eligible for supports under the Regional Airports Programme.  However, for the first time, in recognition of the devastating effects of Covid-19, Budget 2021 has also secured the provision of a capital funding budget of &euro;10 million for Shannon and Cork.  This will contribute to the costs of safety and security related projects at these airports.   </p>  <p>  In addition to these targeted supports, airports will continue to be eligible for the economy wide support measures that are open to all sectors, notably wage supports and tax deferrals.  In relation to any additional support mechanisms for the wider aviation sector, it is intended that these will be developed within the context of the forthcoming National Economic Plan.  </p></reply>

Irish driving licence law is based on a framework of EU law, and the current extensions brings us into line with the EU legislation. </p>  <p>  The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), resumed services in June, following the closure of the centres due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. All appointments must be booked in advance as it is not possible to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working with their providers to see how they can create the additional capacity needed as quickly as possible, while adhering to the return to work protocol. Options being introduced include a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime. The NDLS booking system is undergoing software changes to cater for the expanded booking window associated with the additional NDLS appointment slots. The introduction of these steps may help ease some of the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres.</p>  <p>  Applications can be made online to renew a driving licence or learner permit if no supporting documents are required with the application. The current driving licence online application system does not facilitate the uploading of such supporting documentation. The RSA is continuing work to expand the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit application types.</p>  <p>  Any queries in relation to driving licences or urgent cases can be addressed to the NDLS customer service at 0761087880 or by emailing info@ndls.ie.</p>  <p>  I am also referring the Deputy's question to the RSA for further reply in relation to this specific case, noting that the Deputy has indicated that it appears to relate to an essential worker. Please advise if a reply has not been received within 10 days.  I would also advise the Deputy to advise the person concerned to contact his insurance provider, as a number of insurance providers have indicated that the expiry of a person's driving licence may not necessarily invalidate their insurance, depending on circumstances.</p></reply>

As you are aware, tests were temporarily suspended due to the Covid 19 emergency and since resuming operations, there has been an increased level of demand. Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity is considerably reduced and this means that some customers will experience longer waiting times for a test than was the case before the service was suspended. </p>  <p>  Those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Initially, those who are essential workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. My Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May. The authority is also examining the recruitment and training of new driver testers. However, I would  like to stress that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure that the system returns to normal as soon as possible to allow learner drivers complete their training and, hopefully, pass their test.</p></reply>

As you are aware, tests were temporarily suspended due to the Covid 19 emergency and since resuming operations, there has been an increased level of demand. Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity is considerably reduced and this means that some customers will experience longer waiting times for a test than was the case before the service was suspended. </p>  <p>  My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints. I am pleased to say, my Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May. The authority is also examining the recruitment and training of new driver testers. However, I would  like to stress that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff. </p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased and scheduling additional overtime tests, including testing on Saturdays to increase capacity.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure that the system returns to normal as soon as possible to allow learner drivers complete their training and, hopefully, pass their test.</p></reply>

Amongst the eligibility tests for the relief set out in that section is an age limit, whereby the transferee (the person coming into possession of the land) must be under 35 years of age on the date of execution of the deed of transfer of the land.</p>  <p>  As well as satisfying the age requirement, to qualify for this relief the farmer must have attained a minimum agricultural education standard which is set out on a list of qualifications in Schedule 2B of the SDCA 1999. The young trained farmer, or each of them if there is more than one must retain ownership of the land for a period of 5 years from the date of execution of the instrument and during that time must devote not less than 50 per cent of his or her normal working time to farming the land. The exemption granted will be clawed back if the land is disposed of within a five-year period and is not replaced within one year of disposal. The transfer can be by gift or sale, but transfers by lease do not qualify for the stamp duty exemption. The young trained farmer must also submit a business plan to Teagasc before the execution of the deed transferring the land.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the young trained farmer stamp duty relief is just one of a series of tax measures, including consanguinity stamp duty relief, designed to encourage the intergenerational transfer of farms. The primary policy objectives of the Government in agri-taxation are to support and encourage the increased mobility of farm land to a new generation of farmers with relevant qualifications. The 35 year old age limit is long established for young trained farmer stamp duty relief and has applied since 1994.</p>  <p>  The paper on Stamp Duty prepared by my Department for this year's Tax Strategy Group which took place on 10 September, notes possible inconsistencies in terms of the age at which one ceases to qualify as a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; and my Department will further examine this issue with a view to reporting on the outcome to me in advance of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.</p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - .  The Central Bank has also updated its Covid-19 FAQ in relation to mortgage payment breaks on 18 September.</p><p>However, I am very conscious that many other borrowers, and particularly those who cannot return to work, continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue need assistance and support from their lenders.  As the Deputies know, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September to discuss this matter and we indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty. The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties at the end of the payment break will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed.  </p><p>Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support following a Covid-19 payment break. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.448.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000084#WRK04400"><p>At the outset let me say I have an appreciation of the problems faced by many businesses in relation to public liability insurance, including those in the arts, entertainment and events industry. As this is a commercial matter, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, nor can we specifically compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of insurance by the State, I would be cautious about the introduction of such schemes for a number of reasons.  Firstly, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost would need to reflect the risk involved.  Secondly, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private firms, and therefore be in a position to provide insurance more affordably.  Thirdly, such an approach could actually decrease competition, with insurers potentially discontinuing certain lines if there is a view the State will insure these risks instead, particularly for market segments considered as unprofitable.  This would reduce competition, potentially increasing the cost of premiums.  Accordingly, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a solution to the cost or availability of insurance, either for the arts, entertainment and events industry or other consumers more generally.  </p>  <p>   In this regard the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue. Insurance reform is a key policy priority for this Government as reflected in the Programme for Government (PfG).  There are a number of areas that require reform and this thus requiring a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach as recognised in the PfG. As such this lays out specific commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  </p>  <p>  Implementation of this agenda will be a key issue for myself and Minister of State Fleming as well other members of Cabinet, especially those that will be working on this through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  This is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes myself, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming as standing members. I strongly believe that this Sub-Group provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance through a cross-Governmental response.  We will build and expand upon the previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, particularly with regard to motor insurance where premiums are now a third lower than their mid 2016 peak level. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that, as part of Budget 2021, the Government announced supports for live entertainment to the amount of &euro;50m.  This includes for the first time measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment in venues across the country, building on the demand for support under the July stimulus Music Scheme. A scheme of capital grants for equipment will also operate in 2021. Combined with other measures announced by me, this will provide additional supports to this sector, which I recognise has been severely impacted by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that in addition to the Budget 2021 measures to support the arts, entertainment and events industry, the issue of insurance reform that impacts the entire economy is a key priority issue for this Government.  In that context our focus is to continue to seek to ensure that progress is made in this important policy area.</p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The CRSS will provide support for companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  </p>  <p>  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p>  <p>  Where a company or individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or the business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, because of the restrictions, the company or self-employed individual will qualify for the support. Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p>  <p>  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment to be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to companies and self-employed individuals. </p>  <p>  With the Revenue Commissioners making the tax credit available directly in cash, this valuable upfront cash boost to businesses will be hugely beneficial in enabling them to meet their normal fixed costs such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on. At a later point when the business makes its annual tax return to Revenue for the chargeable period in which the support is received, the normal tax deductions for those fixed costs will be reduced by the State&rsquo;s contribution provided through the CRSS. . Whilst the CRSS payment will reduce the amount of trading expenses that are deductible in computing the taxable income of a business, the CRSS payment will not result in additional tax unless that business has trading profits for the  period. The tax treatment of the ACTE is similar to that which would apply had it been a direct State grant.  </p>  <p>  The CRSS covers the provision of both goods and services. For a business that provides a service to a qualifying business (such as a trading company that operates a theatre), to be eligible to make a claim under the scheme, that other business must meet the eligibility criteria in its own right.  </p>  <p>  The CRSS is targeted at businesses whose premises are affected by the restrictions. Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p></reply>

Following his consideration of these reports and his other considerations, Mr Tutty produced his report entitled 'Review of the Regulation of PCPs' (available at: ).</p><p>The Tutty Report recommended that further consumer protections in relation to PCP agreements be introduced and, in particular, it recommended that the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code which requires lenders to assess the suitability of the product for the consumer and also the ability of the borrower to repay the debt over the duration of the credit agreement, should be extended to hire-purchase/PCP agreements.</p><p>The implementation of this particular recommendation to all the providers of hire purchase and PCP agreements will necessitate new legislation and I have obtained Government approval to draft a Bill to achieve this (see relevant press release attached: ). It is the intention of Government to publish this Bill as soon as possible.</p><p>Hire-purchase providers (entities who underwrite hire purchase agreements) are not currently required to seek authorisation from the Central Bank (or the CCPC) for the provision of hire-purchase agreements such as PCPs.  As the Consumer Protection Code is a binding statutory code on entities regulated by the Central Bank and hire purchase providers are not currently authorised by the Central Bank, they are not subject (for the provision of a hire purchase agreement) to the requirements of the Code. </p><p>The majority of consumer hire purchase agreements, such as PCPs, are provided through &lsquo;credit intermediaries&rsquo; which are authorised by the CCPC.  A car dealer would be a typical example of the type of entity that might act as a credit intermediary.  Any intermediary who is arranging the credit for the consumer is acting as a credit intermediary, and an intermediary arranging such credit must seek authorisation from the CCPC to act as a credit intermediary. A list of authorised credit intermediaries is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that consumers can refer complaints relating to PCP/ hire purchase providers to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p>  <p>  In the first instance I acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged the Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC are, on the basis of the Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a Primary Medical Certificate on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. </p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.</p><p>There are three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. </p><p><b>Group A</b>threshold (currently &euro;335,000) applies where the beneficiary is a child of the disponer. This includes adopted children, step children and some foster children. </p><p><b>Group B </b>threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C</b>threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, consideration of possible changes to CAT rates and thresholds generally takes place as part of the annual Tax Strategy Group, Budget and Finance Bill process. Together, these processes consider options for changes across the wider tax system. In Budget 2021, I made no changes to the CAT Group thresholds.</p><p>However, in Budget 2020, I increased the Group A threshold from &euro;320,000 to &euro;335,000, and in Budget 2019 this was increased from &euro;310,000 to &euro;320,000. </p><p>The Group B threshold was last changed in Budget 2017, when it was increased by &euro;2,350 to its current value of &euro;32,500 and the Category C threshold was also increased by &euro;1,175 to &euro;16,250 at that time. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that there would be a significant cost in making substantial changes to CAT thresholds. The estimated full year cost of increasing the CAT A threshold from its current &euro;335,000 to &euro;500,000 is &euro;68 million.  </p><p>The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds is normally considered in the context of available resources. This of course must be balanced against competing demands and must take into account the need to maintain the yield from CAT. </p></reply>

The reason for this approach is that the capital being transferred has not been earned by the beneficiary. In this context, the effective taxation of windfall capital is an important tool for addressing income and wealth inequality, thus enabling our tax code create a fairer society.</p>  <p>  There are a number of valuable reliefs from Capital Acquisitions Tax available. Once such relief is the CAT Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. This relief allows a nephew or niece to be treated as a child for CAT purposes, subject to certain conditions. This means that they will be entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;335,000, instead of the Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;32,500, which would normally apply to this relationship. </p>  <p>  The aim of this relief is to target a nephew or niece who has worked for their aunt or uncle over a 5-year period prior to inheritance for a minimum number of hours per week, putting their labour and expertise at the disposal of the aunt or uncle and making a sustained contribution to the business before inheritance.</p>  <p>  When combined with CAT Agricultural Relief or CAT Business Relief, this relief is intended to support the intergenerational transfer of a family farm or a family business and is particularly important in circumstances where there may not be a direct descendant (e.g. child) to whom the family farm or business can be bequeathed.</p>  <p>  However, extending the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief to allow the nomination of a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; would clearly represent a fundamental departure from the principles underpinning our current CAT regime, as well as a significant departure from the policy rationale of the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. Such a move would also lead to an erosion of the revenue base. For example, this could result in a beneficiary who does not have a family relationship with the disponer becoming entitled to the same tax-free threshold as a child of the disponer, currently &euro;335,000, instead of a tax-free threshold of &euro;16,250. </p>  <p>  In addition, this would most likely be followed by pressure to extend this more broadly, such as for disponers to seek to nominate a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; for their estate.</p>  <p>  On this basis, there are currently no plans to extend the CAT Favourite Niece or Nephew Relief or to amend the operation of CAT Agricultural Relief to allow for the nomination of a Favourite Successor.</p></reply>

However, this is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.

Regarding Question 228, Table 4 of the same statistics shows the number of employees in respect of whom EWSS is being paid, by their weekly pay range.</p><p>Regarding Question 227, the EWSS operates as a flat rate subsidy based on the number of qualifying employees on each employer&rsquo;s payroll.

It is noted that the legislation implementing the EWSS also provides that the scheme may be extended until the end of June 2021, should it be required.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that a similar type scheme will be needed out to the end of 2021 to provide businesses with greater levels of certainty, to the greatest extent possible. The Government will decide on the form of such a measure, which is expected to be adjusted to suit the economic conditions of 2021, as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  More immediately, the Deputy will be aware that, yesterday, the Government decided upon and announced a move to Level 5 restrictions.  A revision of the rates of subsidy that may be claimed under the EWSS has been announced as part of that.  As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government continues to operate in a highly responsive manner and to adjust policy in relation to the scheme where such changes are deemed necessary.  In this regard also, the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the wage subsidy scheme and this is a duty that I intend to carry out fully over the life of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is noted that EWSS payments have been made to almost 33,000 employers in respect of 341,200 workers in September worth &euro;254 million which is considered strong coverage for employers who need it.</p></reply>

The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is administered by Revenue on a 'self-assessment' basis. I am advised by Revenue that the primary focus at the moment is on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments are registered for the EWSS and receive the payments they are entitled to quickly.  Complementing this focus is a real-time monitoring, and where appropriate, review of submissions received from employers where anomalies are detected to ensure they are corrected in a timely manner, thereby ensuring employers receive their entitlements in a timely manner.    </p>  <p>  The legislation includes specific anti-abuse provisions which underpin the obligation on employers to operate the scheme as intended by the legislation, with bona fide commercial reasons underpinning any changes in the operation of employee payroll arrangements. Section 28B (6)(b)(i) refers to manipulation of payroll to include instances where contractual gross pay which would otherwise have been paid is deferred, suspended, increased or decreased. Section 28B (6)(b)(ii) refers to laying off one employee to replace him or her with more than one employee earning a lower wage, other than for bona fide commercial reasons.   </p>  <p>  The consequences of a determination by Revenue that abuse has occurred would be significant with sanctions imposed reflecting the seriousness of such actions including complete exclusion from the scheme at employer level, a requirement to repay all subsidies already received and PRSI credit issued together with interest, and the employer may face criminal prosecution.  The number of sanctions issued will therefore be available in due course.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the anti-abuse provisions are to act as a deterrent against abuse of the system. I am satisfied that these measures and the real-time monitoring of payroll submissions by Revenue will minimise the opportunity for abuse. The wage subsidy scheme is an exceptional measure to support business and employment in these difficult times and there will be no tolerance for abuse of the scheme. However, I am advised by Revenue that the vast majority of employers are making their best efforts to maintain as much employment as possible and are adjusting their payroll systems, in conjunction with their payroll software providers, to comply with the conditions of the scheme.</p></reply>

The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions.  </p>  <p>  The scheme is just one of a broad range of measures to support various sectors, including hospitality, at this time. For example, I announced in my Budget speech that the VAT rate applied to Tourism and Hospitality related goods and services is to be temporarily reduced from 13.5% to 9%, from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, in recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the sector. </p>  <p>  The Stay and Spend scheme has been in operation since 1 October, and as of 16 October, 2743 business premises had registered to be Qualifying Service Providers. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the Government decision and announcement yesterday to move to Level 5 restrictions, it is still too early in the lifetime of the scheme to conclude that a revision in the estimated cost of same is warranted.</p></reply>

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU. If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues. Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.   </p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme. The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. </p>  <p>  The Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Any changes to the operation of the scheme will of course be kept under review by Revenue.</p></reply>

The proposal for this special new programme demonstrates the importance placed by the EU and by the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom on the strengthening of peace and reconciliation and the enhancement of social and economic capital in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland.</p>  <p>  PEACE PLUS will cover an eligible area of Northern Ireland and Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. It will continue and build upon on the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG cross-border programmes to support North-South cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement. Provision for the PEACE PLUS programme is included in the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK, and in the Political Declaration.</p>  <p>  The development of the draft PEACE PLUS Programme is being led by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), in close cooperation with my Department and by the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. SEUPB is also supported by a Programme Development Steering Group, which consists of representatives of both governments as well as of local government, business, trade union, community and voluntary sector, environment, rural and equality organisations. </p>  <p>  Programme development is now well advanced. An extensive public consultation exercise was carried out by SEUPB between December 2019 and February 2020, which included 16 public events, held in every county in the eligible area, and the collection of over 300 written submissions. SEUPB has also been working closely with government departments from both jurisdictions to identify areas of potential cross-border activity under PEACE PLUS.</p>  <p>  While the detailed drafting of the programme is still underway, the PEACE PLUS programme will allow for very significant cross-border investment over the 2021-27 programming period, across a wide range of areas such as enterprise, research and innovation, infrastructure, health and rural development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.582.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000087#WRN02400"><p>I refer the Deputy to the publication on budget.gov.ie of the document "The Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2021". This document describes the revenue that is expected to be raised by the increased carbon tax in 2021 and the allocation of these sums to particular spending programmes. </p>  <p>  In summary, the sum of the revenues raised by the continuation of the &euro;6 carbon tax increase announced in Budget 2020 and the additional increase announced in Budget 2021 is estimated at &euro;238m in 2021. </p>  <p>  As I noted in my Budget speech, all of these revenues will be returned to citizens. &euro;100m has been allocated to increase the funding for residential and community energy efficiency in 2021. This is an 82% increase in the budget available and means that 2021 will see the largest funding amount ever allocated to these schemes.</p>  <p>  &euro;48m has been allocated to part-fund a social protection package of &euro;153.5m allocated to three measures to protect the vulnerable in society from the impacts of the carbon tax. These measures are an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;5 per week for children over 12, an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;5 per week and an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;3.50 per week. </p>  <p>  This allocation was informed by ESRI research commissioned by the Government to determine whether the carbon tax could be increased in a progressive manner, with impacts on lower-income households and poverty offset through additional spending on social welfare supports.</p>  <p>  The ESRI research confirms that interventions of this nature will reverse the regressive impact of the carbon tax and will actually lead to a reduction in overall poverty, particularly child poverty. In fact, the ESRI found that expenditure levels of just &euro;50m - &euro;55m were sufficient to counteract the regressive impact of the carbon tax.</p>  <p>  By allocating &euro;153.5m in additional social protection spending, the Government ensures that increase in the carbon tax will actually leave a majority of households better off than they were before the increase in the tax. Analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance using SWITCH, the ESRI tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of the reforms on households has confirmed this. The analysis suggests that households in the first five income deciles will see increases in their disposable income as a result of these measures.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also allocated an additional &euro;20m in funding to the agriculture sector. The funds will be used to create an innovative, results-based pilot scheme for farmers who improve the bio-diversity and carbon management of their land by undertaking specific actions which they report directly based on the results generated from their actions. The funds will also contribute to targeting other specific commitments in the Programme for Government, including re-wetting of peat soils and climate and biodiversity training, in measures that will be available to a broad range of farmers. </p>  <p>  Finally, &euro;70m in funding has been allocated to continue the 2020 carbon tax investment programme. Budget 2020 announced that ten programmes would benefit from carbon tax funding. These ranged from the creation of a Just Transition Fund, increases in the allocations to greenways and urban cycling programmes and a &euro;2 increase in the Fuel Allowance. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue funding these programmes in 2021 to the same level as 2020 using carbon tax revenues, with one exception. The Aggregated Housing Upgrade Scheme was a once-off pilot scheme, which is now being rolled out across the midlands. Accordingly, no additional provision has been made for an expansion of this pilot in 2021, pending the outcome of the pilot scheme. </p></reply>

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.</p><p>Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. </p><p>The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. </p><p>Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. </p><p>To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.</p><p>All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is a legal obligation, referred to as the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, and it originates in Section 42 of the The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are members of the Expert Advisory group and the Public Sector Duty is reflected in all Equality Budgeting policies as appropriate. </p><p>In 2019, my Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience.</p><p>Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced. This work is being informed also by the views of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and work is well underway on the various recommendations in the OECD report. </p><p>One example is recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting. Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO have conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and is published on the CSO website at: . Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. </p><p>In the Programme for Government, the Government has also set out its commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people; and ensure that the well-being framework will be utilised in a systematic way across government policymaking (at local and national levels) in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).</p><p>The introduction of wellbeing budgeting will also bring a framework, which will inform equality budgeting development to areas of most need, and link departmental action to national and international equality goals, in line with OECD recommendation number 1.  </p><p>At present, officials in my Department are developing the programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment with regard to well-being.  This work programme will be progressed on a cross-Governmental basis in liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance and other government departments as well as key stakeholders and experts in this area. </p><p>Once developed, the Government will promote the use of a well-being framework in a systematic way across the spectrum of public policy-making in Ireland, including in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting on progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.</p><p>One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policymaking across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.</p><p>Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, deliver on the OECD recommendations step-by-step, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle.</p></reply>

It sets out a framework on managing and living with COVID-19 and includes restrictive measures to help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, while managing the virus. The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time</p>  <p>  One of the Government's priorities is to keep schools and childcare services open, while keeping people safe.  Concerts are classified as indoor and outdoor events under the Plan and are not permitted under Level 5 as no organised indoor gatherings should take place.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that the country will move from Level 5 in due course.  In the interim, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, which I appointed, is expected to report.  This Report should inform the Government's future decision making around live performance and concerts.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government announced the provision of support for live entertainment in the amount of &euro;50m.  This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country.  It will be informed by this year's pilot live performance scheme which was introduced as part of the July Stimulus.  There will be further supports for music, building on the phenomenal demand for support, also under the July stimulus, for the Music Scheme operated by First Music Contact.  A scheme of capital grants for equipment will also operate in 2021.  Combined with measures announced by the Minister for Finance, this will provide additional supports to a sector severely impacted by COVID-19.  Officials in my Department will engage with the sector on the detail of how these new supports will operate, and I hope also to announce the recipients of the pilot scheme shortly.</p></reply>

In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5m Sound and Vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of COVID-19.  This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent  radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.  </p><p>In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 this year in a special round for the community radio sector.</p><p>The purpose of the Sound and Vision Scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the going challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Jobs Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audiovisual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations. </p><p>The BAI are currently assessing the applications with an announcement on awards expected shortly.

Section 3.2.3 of the Guidelines suggests that in areas &ldquo;under major urban influence&rdquo;, planning authorities may define &ldquo;rural generated&rdquo; housing need for &ldquo;Persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development, in order to avoid over-development of those areas.</p>  <p>  National Policy Objective 15 is supplemented by National Policy Objective 19, which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and/or declining.  NPF Policy NPO19 is intended to tie in with the generally established Guidelines approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time in the area) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.  </p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002. The reference to &lsquo;working full or part time&rsquo; in rural areas, is stated to &ldquo;normally encompass&rdquo; persons involved in full-time farming, forestry, the marine or other resource-related occupations, as well as those whose work is &ldquo;intrinsically linked to rural areas&rdquo;.  The 2005 Guidelines did not anticipate digital home working to the extent that is now possible.</p>  <p>  Given the many technological and other changes in policy and in wider society since 2002/5, the superseding of the NSS by the National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, together with other factors, the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines now require updating, in a broader rural development and settlement context, taking into consideration factors that include home working.</p>  <p>  My Department intends to bring forward updated and comprehensive Guidelines that will fully reflect NPF objectives and will bring clarity to the issue of rural housing.  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.</p></reply>

In recognition of the fact that not only were many ratepayers forced to close business due to the public health requirements, but also many that remained open suffered significant reductions in turnover, the waiver was extended from three to six months until 27 September 2020.  A 100% waiver was applied to all businesses with the exception of a small number of categories, mainly banks, utilities, large supermarkets and corporates.  The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers is that their operations are not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately.  &euro;600m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of the six-month waiver, which takes the form of a credit in lieu of rates. </p>  <p>  An initial allocation of funding relating to the waiver, is being paid to local authorities this week.  The main allocation of funding will be made to local authorities following submission of the relevant claim forms from local authorities at the end of October.  Claims relating to appeals from excluded categories are due at the end of November and the final allocation will be paid to local authorities following completion of that process. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government announced an extension of the waiver for the final quarter of the year (until end of December 2020) at an additional cost of &euro;300m.  The criteria for the extended waiver remains the same and it is intended that the waiver for the final quarter will be automatically applied to rate accounts that benefitted from the six-month waiver. A total of &euro;900m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for nine months to the end of December, for eligible businesses.  This unprecedented measure offers support to businesses and certainty to our local authorities. My Department is currently preparing guidance on the administration of the extended waiver for the final quarter.</p></reply>

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.</p>  <p>  In relation to previously owned homes or existing co-owned properties, under Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household shall be ineligible for social housing support if it has alternative accommodation that the household could reasonably be expected to use to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling the accommodation and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation suitable for the household&rsquo;s adequate housing. However, Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there.</p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to local authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act and local authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the local authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.  Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation was undertaken.  The review incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility.  The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda.  The position of those who were tenants in Part V units prior to the introduction of the scheme is a matter for consideration. </p>  <p>  I would hope to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on all social housing reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.  On that basis if the household consists of two adults with two children, the maximum net income threshold for a household in Band 1 is &euro;38,500, in Band 2 &euro;33,000 and the maximum net income threshold for a household in Band 3 is &euro;27,500.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

During this period, in 2018, the National Planning Framework (the NPF) was published and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given the superseding of the NSS by the National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, together with the long-standing need to address the implications of the 2013 European Court of Justice ruling in the "Flemish Decree" case, the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines require updating, in a broader rural development and settlement context.  My Department has commenced scoping this work and I expect a draft by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.</p></reply>

The law, which was adopted without any meaningful consultation of Hong Kong's Legislative Council or civil society, risks undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong under the One Country, Two Systems principle. </p>  <p>  I made a statement on 1 July to express this concern and reiterated Ireland's full support for fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong, such as freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. The matter has also been directly raised with the Chinese Ambassador to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In response to the adoption of this law the Council of the EU adopted Conclusions on Hong Kong on 28 July 2020. These set out a coordinated package of response measures in various fields, including the operation of Member States' extradition agreements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality, has carried out a review of the implications of the introduction of the National Security Law for Ireland's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. Following this review, the Government on 13 October agreed to suspend Ireland's Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  This decision, which was taken in concert with a number of other EU Member States, clearly signals Ireland's concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the erosion of judicial independence promised under the One Country, Two Systems principle. </p>  <p>  My Department, through our Consulate General in Hong Kong and our Embassy in Beijing, will remain alert to the situation in Hong Kong and, along with our EU partners, will continue to raise our concerns with Chinese authorities.</p></reply>

As already set out in the Living with COVID-19 framework, the Government supports this effort to improve co-ordination within the Union and has made clear our intention to align with the new Recommendation. </p>  <p>  The new system categorises regions across Europe by their levels of COVID-19 risk based on a three-strand approach.  This approach examines firstly, the 14-day cumulative incidence rate within the region, secondly, the overall level of testing in the region and finally, the testing positivity rate within the region.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will make a weekly assessment and issue advisory maps of which regions within the EU/EEA are green, orange or red, or, if data is unavailable, grey.</p>  <p>  Under the Recommendation, Member States will lift restrictions applying to green regions within seven days of adoption of the Recommendation.  It is for Member States to determine what restrictions should apply for incoming visitors from the areas that are not classified as green. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Recommendation, persons arriving from green zones will continue not to be subject to any restrictions upon arrival in Ireland.  In view of the current epidemiological situation, those arriving from orange and red zones will continue to be required to restrict their movements for fourteen days upon arrival, as will those arriving from grey regions.  However, those coming from orange regions may waive the requirement to restrict their movements if they can produce a negative test result from an authorised entity three days in advance of their journey to Ireland.  This change, however, will not take effect before 8 November 2020. </p>  <p>  Work will also continue in the coming weeks to amend the Passenger Locator Form so as to allow persons arriving into Ireland to avail of a series of exemptions from the requirement to quarantine provided for in the EU Council Recommendation.</p>  <p>  The Government has also decided that changes for green regions should come into place from midnight Wednesday, 21st of October, with further changes to include the list of exemptions and changes to the requirements for arrivals from orange regions to be effective from midnight Sunday, 8th of November.</p></reply>

This included meetings with representatives from the Administration, as well as with members of Congress - Democrats and Republicans alike - from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Over the course of my visit, I met with Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Representatives Richard Neal, Peter King, Brendan Boyle, Mary Gay Scanlon and other members of the Friends of Ireland caucus, as well as Senators Chris Murphy and Pat Toomey.  I also met National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, and Deputy Secretary of State, Stephen Biegun.  The visit came at an important time for both Ireland and the United States, and reinforced the commitment this Government has to strengthening both our bilateral relationship and wider transatlantic relations.</p>  <p>  As I previously stated, the visit also provided a valuable opportunity to discuss key priorities including Brexit, Northern Ireland and Ireland's priorities for our upcoming term on the UN Security Council with contacts from across the political spectrum. In addition to political engagements, I used the visit to meet with members of the US Chamber of Commerce and to reiterate the strength and mutual benefits of our economic relationship with the United States.  This will be more important than ever as both countries look towards recovery following the global pandemic.</p>  <p>  We  continue to maintain close relations with members of Congress and with our contacts from across the political spectrum at federal, state, city and local levels.  Through the Consulate General in San Francisco in particular, my Department remains engaged with high-level contacts in Washington State, including the Governor's office. Once the current Covid-19 crisis has abated, and in line with public health advice, I hope to get to the opportunity travel to the West Coast of the US.</p></reply>

The Belarusian people continue to make a dignified and resilient stand in defence of the principle that they alone have the right to determine their political leaders. </p>  <p>  Joint action through the EU and with other partners is the optimal way for Ireland to demonstrate our clear and strong support for and solidarity with the Belarusian people. Ireland is working closely with our EU partners to support the Belarusian people and civil society in their simple and clear call for free and fair elections. Having adopted a sanctions regime against those responsible for falsifying the August Presidential election result and the use of State violence against peaceful protesters, the EU is now engaged in a full review of EU-Belarus relations. A "business as usual" approach is not possible and Ireland fully supports the EU Commission's proposal to re-programme EU funds away from the Belarusian authorities and deliver support more directly to the people. Work is ongoing to implement this task and Ireland is actively contributing at EU-level to realise the proposal. </p>  <p>  A national and inclusive dialogue in Belarus is needed to ensure a peaceful and sustainable solution and we continue to support the OSCE offer to visit Minsk and help facilitate talks. As Belarus is a participating Member of the OSCE, we will also continue to encourage upholding of OSCE commitments. </p>  <p>  Free and fair elections require an environment in which human rights are respected. We have called for the immediate and unconditional release of those unjustly detained, for an end to the use of State violence, and for the authorities to respect the rights to freedom of assembly, association and media freedoms. Ireland has been strong in highlighting our deep concerns for the human rights situation in Belarus and we will continue to raise our concerns at human rights fora, including during the upcoming Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the approach being taken by our EU partners, Ireland will also examine what actions we can take to support civil society in Belarus.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, the award of Distinguished Service Medals (DSM) and Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) are provided for in Defence Forces Regulations (DFR) A9.  This regulation also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.  It is important that in order to maintain the prestige of such medals and indeed all of those provided for in DFR A9, that the criteria outlined is strictly adhered to.</p>  <p>  The introduction of any change to the regulations or to the criteria for the award of DSMs or MMGs is not a straightforward matter with many associated complexities.  Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising such as maintaining the integrity of the award of medals system and implications for previous decisions of properly constituted medals boards.  The availability of documentary evidence and official records also presents a challenge in this case.  It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered. At this juncture, no new information has come to light that would be cause for the matter to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Chief of Staff is re-examining the issue of Jadotville and current issues. </p></reply>

Waterford and in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon.  There are 9 children at primary level currently accessing education in EROCs, 7 children since January  2020 and 2 since September 2020.  When all school buildings closed in March as part of the response to Covid-19, enrolment in local mainstream schools was delayed pending school re-opening. </p>  <p>  Children did not transfer to local mainstream schools when they re-opened in September as they were not considered school&ndash;ready and some families were due to be resettled.   Any of the children who are now school ready and where no arrangements are in place for resettlement, will be transitioned to local primary schools after the mid-term break.</p>  <p>  The Department has mandated relevant Education and Training Boards (ETB) to provide for the interim educational needs of families accommodated in EROCs.  The agreed protocol between this Department and Education and Training Boards sets out arrangements for the delivery of on-site education provision within EROCs and transition to local mainstream schools.  A Memorandum of Understanding was put in place between the Department of Education and Skills with the Department of Justice and Equality to facilitate inspections of the EROC schools.   </p>  <p>  It is intended that these two education settings located in EROCs will be subject to annual inspection.  During the period of school closures and since September, inspectors have engaged with education settings attached to EROCs in the same way as they have engaged with schools.   </p>  <p>   During the period of school closures from March to June 2020, inspectors contacted schools with a view to offering advisory engagements.  The main purpose of the advisory engagements was to offer the school principal an opportunity to engage with the inspector on the continuity of learning during the period of school building closures.  In that regard, inspectors also contacted the education settings at the two Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to offer advisory engagements.  These offers were taken up in both instances and the advisory engagements were scheduled and carried out. </p>  <p>  Inspectors are currently contacting schools to offer further advisory engagements focused on issues relating to the resumption of schooling, wellbeing and the delivery of the curriculum.  In that regard, the education settings attached to EROCs have been offered advisory engagements and it is expected that these will be scheduled to take place in the near future.</p>  <p>  In both EROCs, the teachers of primary level children are qualified primary teachers. These teachers  may also avail of the educational support services of the Department of Education, including the advice and support of the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS), the National Council for Special Educational Services (NCSE), the Inspectorate and appropriate Continuous Professional Development (CPD) through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).</p></reply>

Contingency planning is required to support continuity of pupils/students&rsquo; learning and the use of digital technology where possible will be used to facilitate this. It is important that planning and the adoption of approaches are based on a whole-school approach. Given the fluidity of requirements to meet the various potential scenarios that living with Covid-19 entails, it is important that schools review and adapt their plans over the coming weeks and months as the situation evolves and as the experience of schools in providing for continuity of learning increases.</p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning and this guidance is all available at  </p><p>The guidance includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools.</p><p>In addition, my Department has issued ICT grant funding to schools to address ICT needs including digital devices, communication/learning platforms, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning. Additional grant aid will issue during the current school year.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is supporting school communities to provide effectively for the learning and progression of all learners during the first term of the 2020/21 school year.</p><p>The situation we find ourselves in is evolving all the time.  My Department, in working with the whole of Government, will keep the situation under review and update any advices to schools as required. It is with the work of all our stakeholders together that we will continue to provide the best education for all our pupils/students.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, the appeal was not heard by the IEAC until 25th August 2020.  Following on from the Appeal hearing, the IEAC requested some clarification on documentation that was submitted by the school in relation to the Irish Exemption refusal.  This clarification was received in my Department on 12th October.

I have met with F&oacute;rsa, who represent many of the secretaries working in schools.   </p>  <p>  In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies met with F&oacute;rsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  I support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

This number excludes students who initially entered for an appeal but later withdrew their application.</p>  <p>  As a result of the process, a total of 18 increased grades have been awarded to 18 individual students.  Eleven of these were upgrades following an appeal by the student. A further seven grades were upgraded following quality assurance checks as part of the appeals process which involved checks on the documentation submitted by schools; the entry of that data on to the schools' data collection system; and the subsequent transmission of the data through the various IT systems used in the generation of calculated grades. </p>  <p>  The appeals process was a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.  It was not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school was outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process was also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  The CAO were also notified of changes to students&rsquo; results on 16 October. Candidates who are eligible for a new offer as a result of the upgraded mark received following the appeals process will be contacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.</p></reply>

This is consistent with public health advice internationally.  The guidance is available at the following link.</p><p>My Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for students with an underlying medical condition who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; to COVID-19.

Schools have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their students, including students at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; to COVID-19. Facilitating engagement with and among pupils is essential to their learning experience and maintaining their social and emotional development.  </p><p>Teachers can facilitate this through online interaction, providing feedback on work completed, organising project work that pupils can complete as part of a group and providing learning experiences based on pair work and group work. Early and ongoing two-way communication between the pupil&rsquo;s school, class teacher, designated teacher where relevant, and the home will be essential to supporting the pupils&rsquo; engagement with their learning and their continuous connection with their classmates and school community.</p></reply>

I have met with F&oacute;rsa, who represent many of the secretaries working in schools.</p>  <p>  In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies met with F&oacute;rsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  I support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s recent announcement to defer industrial action and their commitment to resuming engagement with all parties at the WRC. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>     The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms from and are attending their nearest Primary School as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport but who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  </p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s primary school education cycle.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that the children to whom the Deputy refers reside 0.9kms from their nearest primary school and are therefore not eligible under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received by the family in question on 8th September 2020 and that the service was operating to capacity when payment was made. A refund will issue to the family in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, aligned to the public health advice received shortly before schools reopened which advised that the post-primary scheme should run at 50% capacity.  The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks, while Bus &Eacute;ireann has been carrying out a detailed analysis of the resources required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Over the coming weeks, Bus Eireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on each individual route. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  </p>  <p>  An analysis has been conducted to determine what is required to fully implement all post-primary school services to operate at 50% capacity.   The estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required. </p>  <p>  With regard to the school referred to by the Deputy, Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that there are currently a number of Transport Services for pupils with Special Educational Needs operating to this  school.  One of these services has a pupil of post-primary school going age on board. The Bus &Eacute;ireann local office is currently assessing this route in order to comply with the public health 50% capacity guidelines and measures will be implemented as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

This includes guidelines on the adjusted assessment arrangements for state examinations in summer 2021. The Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021 are available at the following link: . </p><p>As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study have been made for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20, and may occur in 2020/21, was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021. </p><p>These adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. The key stakeholders that were consulted in relation to the document included unions representing teachers, and school management bodies.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. </p><p>For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>When a school has been allocated an SNA, the Board of Management, as the employer, is responsible for filling the vacancy. Details of the recruitment process which applies to SNAs is detailed in Department Circular 0051/2019: Recruitment and Appointment Procedures for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs),which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at:  </p><p>Circular 0051/2019 sets out the role of the Board of Management in the appointment of SNA&rsquo;s. The circular states that the Board of Management, in accordance with the procedures set out in the circular, is responsible for the appointment of SNAs in schools. Any such appointment is subject to the prior approval of the school&rsquo;s Patron/ETB. </p><p>The Circular further sates that an SNA shall only be appointed to a post which is to be filled within the allocation of posts approved by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). </p><p>The matter of Lucan Community National School increased SNA allocation approval is a matter for the NCSE. The Departments payroll only funds SNA posts sanctioned by the NCSE.</p><p>The query raised refers to the School's SNA allocation and related communications.  Accordingly, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. As Minister, I have no role in making determinations in individual cases.</p></reply>

This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  There are currently 16,969 Special Needs Assistants allocated to schools. Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available. </p>  <p>  A new model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM).  </p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis the Frontloaded Allocation Model for Special Needs Assistants was deferred until the beginning of the 2021/22 school year. </p>  <p>  As it was too late to run the traditional applications-based process for the allocation model, special arrangements were put in place to facilitate SNA allocations for mainstream classes the 2020/21 school year. The arrangements did not impact on the way SNAs are allocated to special classes and special schools. </p>  <p>  The SNA allocation that applied to mainstream classes were frozen from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020 and automatically rolled over into the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  Schools can apply to the NCSE for additionality, by way of an exceptional review process, where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school.    </p>  <p>  Further advice will issue in the course of the 2020/21 school year on the introduction of the frontloaded model with effect from September 2021.

I have met with F&oacute;rsa, who represent many of the secretaries working in schools. </p>  <p>  In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies met with F&oacute;rsa on 1 October under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  I support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. In that respect, I have asked my officials to examine closely pay issues for secretaries and caretakers, as well as very important wider matters relating to their conditions of work, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s recent announcement to defer industrial action and their commitment to resuming engagement with all parties at the WRC. </p></reply>

The Act sets out the responsibility of the NCSE to coordinate and plan for the provision of education for children with special educational needs nationwide and to advise the Minister for Education and Skills in relation to matters regarding the education for persons with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to the manner in which the NCSE fulfils its statutory requirements under section 41(1)(c) and 41 (2) of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. </p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. In April 2020, a Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with this legislation and confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.</p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p></reply>

The advice confirms that for the vast majority of children, can return to school and it is important for the overall health and wellbeing for children to attend school. This is consistent with public health advice internationally.  The guidance is available at the following link.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 27 July last the Government published the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, along with details of a significant financial package to support the implementation of the measures in the roadmap. The package of supports is expected to cost in excess of &euro;437 million in the 2020/2021 school year.</p><p>The range of supports being made available to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, includes additional financial supports to provide for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment costs under the Covid-19 response plans. The Government also approved a package of minor works grants as part of the July Stimulus to support schools to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has considered the national experience of school reopening to date, including the epidemiological data and information gathered through case and outbreak management.  The experience to date since schools reopened is reassuring and supports the current international position that schools and childcare facilities do not appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 transmission in the community.  It is clear that the exceptional efforts of school staff, children and parents/guardians in implementing the public health guidance has contributed to the safe and successful reopening of schools in Ireland.  </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, aligned to the public health advice received shortly before schools reopened which advised that the post-primary scheme should run at 50% capacity.   The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks, while Bus &Eacute;ireann has been carrying out a detailed analysis of the resources required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Over the coming weeks, Bus Eireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on each individual route. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills have supported all bus contractors to put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on the buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible. This reduces the interaction of children on the buses with those outside of their family, class or school. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  </p>  <p>  An analysis has been conducted to determine what is required to fully implement all post-primary school services to operate at 50% capacity.  The estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. </p>  <p>  Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets.</p></reply>

It is not the aim of Religious Education to facilitate Religious Instruction or a type of learning that has as its aim nurturing into a particular religious tradition or set of beliefs. </p>  <p>  Currently at Primary level, Religious Education is one of 12 subjects in the 1999 Primary School Curriculum. It holds a unique position in that the responsibility for providing a programme of RE rests with the patron bodies of individual schools and not the State.  There are a number of patrons&rsquo; programmes within the primary school system reflecting the diversity of patronage. Some of these are denominational or religious in nature, emphasising the place of children&rsquo;s faith, spiritual and moral development in their lives. Other patrons&rsquo; programmes are ethical in nature and emphasise fostering children&rsquo;s understanding of ethics and values. </p>  <p>  In its review and redevelopment of the primary curriculum, the NCCA is currently consulting with the public on a Draft Primary Curriculum (PC) Framework.  The Framework aims to support the learning and development of children from different religious backgrounds and of non-religious backgrounds as we move into a new era in Irish education.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, the NCCA-developed Religious Education Junior and Senior Cycle syllabuses are intended for students of all faith backgrounds and none. The content prescribed in the syllabuses is intended to ensure that students are exposed to a broad range of religious traditions and to the non-religious interpretation of life. They do not provide religious instruction in any particular religious or faith tradition.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education does not require schools to include the NCCA-developed Religious Education specification at Junior or Senior Cycle syllabus as mandatory subjects on their curriculum.  Accordingly, schools have discretion to determine if they provide the subject at all or if it is to be mandatory or optional for any particular class group or in any year.</p>  <p>  The Department position on Religious Instruction at post-primary is as set out in circulars 13/2018 and 62/2018. These circulars are addressed to the management authorities of Community and ETB post-primary schools only. It includes Community Post Primary Schools where in addition to an Education and Training Board (ETB) the patronage is exercised by one or more catholic religious orders and/or a catholic diocese.</p>  <p>  Religious instruction (non NCCA) can be provided in ETB and community schools, but they must be compliant with circulars 0013/2018 and 0062/2018.</p>  <p>  Voluntary secondary schools can provide religious instruction in line with the ethos of the schools. However, if they provide Junior Cycle NCCA developed RE it must be delivered in the timetabled class periods without any religious instruction or worship of any religion forming any part of class activity. This means that any practice or material that would introduce religious instruction or worship cannot be used. Religious Education will be subject to inspection including its delivery according to this circular.</p>  <p>  Where any school opts to teach a programme of religious instruction/faith formation that is rooted exclusively or almost exclusively in a particular religious tradition, parents must be advised of this and &lsquo;the school must offer an alternative subject(s) for those who do not want religious instruction&rsquo;. (Circular 0013/2018).</p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post-primary level to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects (STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics, in particular) as well as substitutes.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group on Teacher Supply, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in response to these issues. The Steering Group is overseeing the implementation of the Teacher Supply Action Plan, which was launched in November 2018.</p>  <p>  Following from the Action Plan, the HEA issued a call to initial teacher education (ITE) providers for proposals for flexible programmes to upskill registered post primary teachers in 3 subjects: mathematics, physics and Spanish. The HEA&rsquo;s call was made on behalf of the Department and was open to providers of ITE programmes accredited by the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  The upskilling programmes will offer teachers a route to upskill to meet the Teaching Council&rsquo;s curricular subject requirements.

There are no plans to change this status of CE supervisors. The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees of similar schemes in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p><p>At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in ongoing communication on the matter. </p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before the end of the year . </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Self-employed people must have suffered a reduction in their trading income to the extent that they are available for other full time work to qualify for the payment. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides that recipients engaging in self-employment can earn up to &euro;480 over a four week period and continue to maintain entitlement to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  The &euro;480 limit is based on gross income, before tax and PRSI, minus expenses.</p>  <p>  Where a person exceeds this threshold and is engaging in regular limited self-employment, access to the Part-Time Job Incentive has been extended to those who transition from the Pandemic Unemployment payment.  Under this scheme, a self-employed recipient of the Pandemic Unemployment, for at least 16 weeks, can engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours per week and retain a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60.  A self-employed jobseeker with a qualified adult can be paid &euro;209.70 per week.</p>  <p>  The objective of these measures is to provide that a self-employed person in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or jobseekers payments can retain income support in limited circumstances where they engage in self-employment.  It is envisaged that these measures will assist businesses to open and support the rehiring of staff but due to the pandemic can only do so intermittently or on a limited or reduced basis.  These measures apply to all self-employed recipients including those operating as taxi drivers.</p>  <p>  A self -employed person may also be eligible for support under the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant which provides support of up to &euro;1,000 with business re-start costs where a person transitions from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment back into employment.  Budget 2021 has provided that this support will be extended until 2021. Further information on this grant is available on www.gov.ie</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

These supports include T&uacute;s and community employment (CE), both of which are positive initiatives that enable participants to make a valuable contribution to their communities. </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s and CE are active labour market programmes designed to provide eligible people with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis, while helping to break the cycle of unemployment and improving a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market. Although the aims of T&uacute;s and CE are similar, there are some subtle differences between the two programmes. </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s is confined to those who are on the live register and unemployed for more than a year, and the targeted activation of this cohort aims to provide additional assistance and a renewed impetus to these jobseekers that could otherwise be in danger of persistent long-term unemployment. The maximum duration for participation on T&uacute;s is 12 months.</p>  <p>  The focus of CE is also on the cohort of long-term unemployed people but it extends to other disadvantaged persons.  CE has an additional training and up-skilling element which enables CE participants to achieve a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award.  In general, participation on CE for those aged between 21 and 55 years is for 1 year.  Where a CE participant is working towards a QQI major award or working towards a recognised industry standard, their time on CE may be extended by up 2 years to complete this training.  In addition, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for 3 years. </p>  <p>  Although both employment programmes have similar aims, there are currently no plans to fuse the T&uacute;s and CE schemes or to provide discretion to the supervisors of these schemes to transfer participants from one scheme to another.  There is however an opportunity for a T&uacute;s participant who has completed their 12 month placement on T&uacute;s, to apply for a placement on CE should they wish to pursue the training and development opportunities available through CE. </p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  There are currently no plans to change the qualifying criteria for T&uacute;s or CE, to widen the range of qualifying social welfare payments for T&uacute;s or to extend the duration of placement on T&uacute;s beyond twelve months, as per the proposal of a two-tiered delivery; or in light of Covid-19.  T&uacute;s and CE will continue to support those who are furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the July Stimulus Package, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on State Employment Schemes, including T&uacute;s and CE.  This will provide opportunities for an increase in existing T&uacute;s and CE participant numbers and services provided to local communities.</p>  <p>   A number of factors will inform the decision on the allocation of the additional places.  These factors will include training and development opportunities, participant development requirements, existing employment support schemes and regional Live Register data.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep under review the overall operation of T&uacute;s and CE, and is very aware of the significant number of people who are actively engaged with these programmes in the delivery of valuable services to local communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of these programmes and will continue to support and improve these programmes for the benefit of the T&uacute;s and CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

The trust deeds and rules of a scheme differ from one to another and, as with any contractual situation, reflect the level of obligation on the parties involved.  While the Pensions Act 1990 provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes, it does not impose any requirement on an employer to fund scheme benefits or maintain an existing scheme.  It is important to note that there has never been debt on employer legislation in effect in Ireland. </p>  <p>  To introduce legislation of this nature would be very complex and would require very careful consideration given the impact it could have on employers  and ultimately their willingness to sponsor occupational pension schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Pensions Authority, is continuing to actively monitor the defined benefit regulatory regime to ensure it appropriately balances fairness between all generations of scheme members with the need to help sponsoring employers, employees and scheme trustees maintain the sustainability of their pension schemes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

My Department has advised that subject to satisfying the relevant eligibility criteria, employees may claim casual or part-time jobseeker payments or Short-Time Work Support payments for days of unemployment, even where their employer is claiming the EWSS for days of employment.  The normal scheme rules and application processes apply, including completion of the relevant forms by the employer to certify days of employment and unemployment.  </p>  <p>  The TWSS and the EWSS are different schemes meaning that entitlement to a concurrent jobseeker payment under the EWSS does not imply the same entitlement under the TWSS. </p>  <p>  Section 28(5)(h) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that where the TWSS applies in relation to a specified employee for any week, the specified employee shall not be entitled to any benefit or payment, related to Covid-19, from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for that week.</p>  <p>  Decisions around individual entitlements to social welfare claims for periods where the TWSS was being availed of by the employer depends on meeting the eligibility conditions, including satisfying the Department with regard to days of unemployment, including that no remuneration was payable for any such day of unemployment.  This requires that the specific work pattern and remuneration arrangement in place for each individual are examined for this period. </p>  <p>  Information on the numbers of recipients of short time work support and in receipt of the TWSS concurrently is not available. </p></reply>

This extension will be made available retrospectively to parents in respect of children born or adopted on or after 1st November 2019.  The period during which this leave can be taken will be extended from 12 to 24 months so it can be taken up to a child's second birthday or within two years following adoption.  Parents will therefore not lose out on their entitlement to these extra weeks.</p>  <p>  There is a necessary lead-in time following the announcement of this extension to facilitate its implementation.  Firstly, legislative change is required by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth which has responsibility for parents leave policy.  This legislation needs to be carefully prepared and drafted before being brought through the Oireachtas, given that it extends a statutory leave entitlement that, in addition to benefitting workers, has implications for employers.</p>  <p>  It will also be necessary for parallel amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) to be drafted and brought through the Oireachtas to provide the legislative basis for the extended payment of benefit.</p>  <p>  In addition, significant changes are required to the Department's systems to administer this extension, including the provision of retrospective entitlement.  This work needs to be undertaken in such as way that is does not compromise existing supports in an environment where there are unprecedented levels of demand on the Department&rsquo;s services due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The extra weeks of leave will be made available as soon as the necessary legislation which is being drafted by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is enacted. </p>  <p>  Once the new application and payment system goes live in April, my Department will then process and issue benefit payments - to include backdated payment of benefit as appropriate - in respect of Parents Leave taken from the date of enactment.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the timing of the implementation of this measure is a concern for some parents. I can assure the Deputies that everything is being done to make this extension available as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In that regard, the only jobseekers that usually qualify for a Bonus are those on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance who have been in receipt of a payment for 15 months or more.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on employment levels and the sudden financial impact on individuals, the Bonus will be paid this year to people have been in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a period of four months or more and are in payment on the date the Bonus is paid.  It will also be paid to people on jobseeker payments who have been in receipt of these payments for four months or more.  This four month period does not necessarily need to be continuous. </p>  <p>  The decision to reduce the time from 15 months to four to become eligible for the Bonus was made to ensure that it is paid to those who have been made unemployed for a significant period since the first shutdown of businesses, and also to reflect the exceptional situation brought about by the pandemic.</p></reply>

It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents and to offer a financial incentive to take up and remain in employment.</p>  <p>  Increasing the Working Family Payment income threshold for families with one, two or three children in recent budgets is a targeted measure benefiting low income families.  Increasing income thresholds is a measure that is directly linked to household income and therefore directly supports low-income working families.  As of June 2020 families with one, two or three children represented 86% of all Working Family Payment recipient households.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of increasing the income threshold for families with one, two or three children, by &euro;10 per week as announced in Budget 2021, is estimated at &euro;21.4 million.  If this measure were to be extended to all family sizes the additional estimated expenditure would be &euro;2.6 million.  </p>  <p>  The Budget measure is, in particular, intended to target the most vulnerable families such as lone parent families - who are typically households with one or two children.  Lone parents accounted for 49% of all Working Family Payment recipients in 2019. For the majority of these families the Working Family Payment is their primary source of income support from the Department.</p></reply>

Targeted annual youth funding of &euro;38.7m is allocated under the scheme.</p>  <p>  Key to achieving the scheme's aims is the development of the Area Profile and Needs Assessment Tool. The purpose of this Tool is to allow each ETB to avail of quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within their functional area. This analysis leads to the development of a Service Requirement which is then used as the basis for discussion between ETBs and service providers in terms of service delivery to meet the needs of young people in the area. </p>  <p>  The approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidenced need.

This is a targeted youth funding scheme aimed at supporting young people between the ages of 10 and 24 who are at risk of becoming disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable. It replaces the Special Youth Funding (SPY), the Young Peoples Facilities Funding (Rounds 1 and 2) and Local Drug Task Force funding directed at young people.  The launch of UBU &ndash; Your Space Your Place marked the culmination of five years preparation, consultation, design and implementation of the reform of youth funding in Ireland recommended in the Value for Money and Policy Review for Youth Programmes (2014).  </p><p>A key tenet of the UBU &ndash; Your Space Your Place scheme is the production of evidence of local need.  The scheme entails a robust process by which new services may enter the scheme and existing schemes may be augmented. In allocating funding under the scheme, each ETB carries out an Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service requirement process. This process draws upon quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within the ETB&rsquo;s functional area. This analysis leads to the development of a Service Requirement which is then used as the basis for discussion between ETBs and service providers in terms of service delivery to meet the needs of young people in the area. This approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidenced need. </p><p>In 2020, UBU funding for Kildare projects amounts to &euro;246,705; a further &euro;246,703 was allocated for the Targeted Youth Funding Scheme (TYFS), and &euro;50,759 is provided for Youth Information Centres in the county. </p><p>Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB, who act on behalf of my Department in administering youth funding in that area, receive funding for Technical Assistance and Youth Work Functions (&euro;190,000 in 2020).  They administer the Local Youth Club Funding Scheme, the LBGTI+ funding scheme and the Covid 19 Small grants scheme (&euro;158,500; &euro;4,000 and &euro;3,000 respectively in 2020).  The Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB also administer the 2020 Capital funding scheme for the area which amounted to just over &euro;20,000 in total. </p></reply>

However, an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 is being carried out in my Department, which will examine foster care arrangements as part of the overall review. </p>  <p>  The Foster Care Allowance is &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 and over. The allowance is paid for the child in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs, hobbies, and sporting activities. The Foster Care Allowance is tax free and not included in means testing for Social Welfare.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge foster carers as the backbone of our child care services in Ireland. Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians, and as of June 2020, the most recent date for which figures are available, 91 per cent of children in care were in foster care or relative foster care (65% and 26% respectively). A number of targeted supports are available to foster carers to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. These supports include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings, and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. </p>  <p>  It is important that foster careers can access specialist services to meet a child&rsquo;s identified needs. Respite care for children may also be arranged, if part of their care plan. Pre-assessment and continuous training is compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care. The specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care mean that Tusla addresses the training needs of relative foster carers separately. Also, Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which provides supports to carers such as advocacy, mediation, training, and a phone advice service. </p></reply>

The legislation provides a legal basis for the transfer of specified databases and related records from the Commission to the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) and ensures that the records deposited with my Department are preserved in full.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Commission advised that it had created a database during the course of its work of persons who spent time in the main Mother and Baby Homes under investigation. However, the Commission did not feel it had a legal basis to transfer that database and would be compelled by law to redact the valuable information we are trying to now preserve. This Bill proposes to allow the database to be preserved and transferred to Tusla, as the Agency already holds most of the original records. It aims to prevent the information from effectively being destroyed, and legislates to allow access to that information under existing laws. </p>  <p>  The immediate and urgent policy intent in drafting a Records Bill is to ensure the Commission's database, and related records, are preserved and available to support current and future tracing services. The Bill is currently making its way through the Houses and following debate in the Seanad, I will be bringing forward a number of amendments to the published Bill in response to a number of the issues which have emerged. </p>  <p>  I am aware that interesting proposals have been developed in relation to the potential development of a national archive of institutional abuse at the former Se&aacute;n McDermott Street Laundry.  While this is a matter worthy of further discussion, I am mindful that it is a complex matter which extends beyond my own Department. It would require detailed consideration and extensive engagement, both with other Government colleagues and Departments, and with a large number of statutory bodies and stakeholder groups.  </p>  <p>  I am also conscious that the Government will wish to consider the final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation prior to considering its overall response to issues of this nature.</p>  <p>  I am absolutely committed to addressing the wider matter of providing a new architecture surrounding access to birth information and tracing; this will be advanced soon. I look forward to engaging widely to allow all those with a stake in this process to have their voice heard.</p></reply>

This statutory inquiry is investigating the lived experiences of mothers and children in these institutions and I am acutely aware that this is not simply an historical or legal matter, but that these experiences continue to impact the lives of many women, children and their families today.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to effective stakeholder engagement on all matters that impact former residents of these institutions. I am considering how best to facilitate that in the immediate term, in particular in light of current public health restrictions related to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Collaborative Forum process, established by my predecessor as a representative body on these matters, was unfortunately interrupted by the general election and subsequent change in Government. In addition, it was necessary to put these meetings on hold in the context of the restrictions introduced in an effort to reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19. A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and, given the age profile involved, some members would also be categorised as being in the at risk groups identified by public health authorities. </p>  <p>  From our experience to date, it is evident that remote meetings based on the use of technology would present additional challenges for an engagement process as sensitive as this one. However, I hope to make arrangements to engage with former residents and their advocates in the near future and my Department is examining how best this could be facilitated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a copy of the Collaborative Forum's report was provided by my Department to the Commission of Investigation for its appropriate attention and consideration in the context of its statutory investigations. When the Commission submits its final report in the coming weeks, the Government will be in a position to examine its findings and conclusions and engage with former residents and their advocates in formulating an appropriate State response. The significant work of the of the Collaborative Forum to identify the priority concerns of those most centrally involved will assist to inform this process. At that time it will also be possible to consider publication of the Forum's report subject to any further advices of the Attorney General.  </p></reply>

This excludes substantial funding provided to support the sector during the closure period from March - June and to operate in a COVID-19 context since reopening. Despite this progress, investment in the area remains low by international standards.</p>  <p>  In their latest calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on early learning and care, the OECD includes an estimate of the cost of primary school for children aged under 6 years.</p>  <p>  This is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in other countries. Using this measure, Ireland spends an estimated 0.5% of GDP on early learning and care.</p>  <p>  If the cost of primary school for children aged under 6 is excluded, Ireland spends just 0.2% of GDP on this area, compared to the OECD average of 0.7%. Our spending also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1.0% of GDP.</p>  <p>  It is important to note however that Irish GDP is seen as a poor point of international comparison and work is underway to provide more analysis using an alternative benchmark. That being said everyone acknowledges we need greater investment.</p>  <p>  The First 5 Strategy, commits the Government to at least double public spending on early learning and care services by 2028. This doubling of investment would increase Ireland&rsquo;s position by &euro;574m or by approximately an extra 0.2 per cent of GDP.  Every 0.1% increase in spending as a share of GDP would cost an estimated &euro;339m per annum.</p>  <p>  A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers optimally for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model was appointed in September 2019. The Group will examine how additional public funding can be used to deliver higher quality, more affordable, more sustainable and more inclusive services.</p>  <p>  This important project is recognised in the Programme for Government. I am pleased that a programme of consultation is currently underway and I greatly look forward to receiving their report next year. </p></reply>

School-age childcare has been centre-stage in the Department&rsquo;s thinking throughout this time, and it remains high on the agenda of the Advisory Group on Reopening, which meets on a regular basis. Throughout the pandemic a primary focus of my Department has been, and remains, on sustaining the early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) sector. We have kept services open by funding the additional costs associated with following public health guidance, the cost of lower occupancy, and through encouraging greater uptake of childcare places.</p><p>The key new contributor to the ELC and SAC sector is the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which funds up to &euro;200 per week per staff member. This funding in now secured until 31 March next and I will continue to work to ensure that the needs of the sector are recognised in any reforms of the scheme thereafter.</p><p>A second key contributor to the sector in 2021 will be to encourage more parents to access safe and more affordable early learning and childcare services. We have witnessed a reduction in demand in 2020 in terms of numbers and hours. </p><p>Despite this, I have retained all funding in Budget 2021, meaning that there is funding available for up to 20,000 new families to join the National Childcare Scheme and access subsidies of up to &euro;200 per child, per week. </p><p>School-age childcare is central to the childcare funding schemes. The National Childcare Scheme allows parents receive hourly subsidies for wrap-around childcare in term-time, and for longer hours over holiday periods. I was pleased to increase the number of subsidised hours from September this year, partly to address the concerns of providers. </p><p>Where providers are struggling with an imminent threat to the viability of the service arising from a demonstrated decline in occupancy and/or demonstrated increase in costs due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, my Department has made available financial support in the form of COVID-19 Sustainability Support funding. This sustainability funding is available to both private, for-profit providers and community non-profit providers, subject to eligibility criteria and an assessment of need.</p><p>As of 1 October, the ELC and SAC COVID-19 Sustainability Support Fund is now open for applications. This funding is accessible to providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) who can demonstrate that the other measures available as part of the July Stimulus Package are not sufficient by themselves to enable viable operations of their business. Further information in relation to eligibility is available in the Applicant Guidelines. The Application Form, Workbook, and Applicant Guidelines for the ELC &amp;amp; SAC COVID-19 Sustainability Support Fund are available on the Hive and can be accessed at the following link: .  Support for ELC and SAC providers in relation to the completion of the application form and workbook is available via the local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs). Contact details for the CCCs can be found in the Guidelines document, or at .</p><p>In addition to the COVID-19 Sustainability Support, my Department oversees a case management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services and school-age childcare services in difficulty. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance. The CCC, where appropriate, will proceed to make a formal notification to Pobal who will provide more consolidated support while verifying the service&rsquo;s necessity for a financial intervention. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p><p>In relation specifically to the reduction in attendance at school-age childcare services, officials in my Department are keeping this matter under review.</p></reply>

While the scheme's operational details were being finalised, to assist with cashflow challenges, preliminary payments were paid in advance to providers to enable them retain their staff and cover some overhead costs. The preliminary payments  were based on estimates of each individual service&rsquo;s staff, in advance of the more detailed TWSCS subsidy calculations, and primarily based on pre-covid staffing levels. It emerged subsequently that such staffing levels were not maintained by some providers and this has resulted in excess funding.</p>  <p>  At present, Pobal are undergoing a reconciliation process between the final subsidy amount actually due to providers and the preliminary payments that were made. The process is expected to conclude in late October.  </p>  <p>  The final overpayment amount will be communicated to providers from late October. There are a number of providers where issues have been identified with their application. Those providers will be given the opportunity to correct any elements before final payment. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, providers can view their current overpayment position by referring to the Contract and Payment Statement TWSCS on PIP (Pobal IT system). The TWSCS contract value is provided, along with the amount paid, resulting in a balance due. If the balance due is negative, it indicates an overpayment position.</p>  <p>  Due to pressures providers face at the beginning of any programme year, my Department decided to hold off recoupment until November. The overpayments will be offset against beneficiary funding payments due to be paid to providers then. For providers due more than one payment in November, we will spread the amount involved against all their payments to lessen the impact.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some providers may require special or alternative arrangements due to ongoing cashflow difficulties. My Department and Pobal are prepared to be flexible in supporting providers who may struggle with recoupment and Pobal will be available to work closely with these providers.    </p>  <p>  Government has provided an estimated &euro;180m to the childcare sector in 2020 above and beyond the normal childcare budget; this is alongside parental fees. A further &euro;60m is due in the first quarter of 2021 under the EWSS. All these supports are expected to meet the needs of the vast majority of providers.  If however a provider continues to experience viability issues,  my Department has put in place a new Sustainability Fund. This will assist providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) struggling with an imminent threat to the viability of their service arising from a decline in occupancy and/or demonstrated increase in costs due to the COVID-19 Pandemic that has not been addressed by all other measures. Details on eligibility and how to apply for the new sustainability fund are available on the Pobal provider platform. In the meantime, the Department encourages providers seeking further advice and support to contact their City/ County Childcare Committee in the first instance.</p></reply>

We are in the process of implementing a number of key strategies which are helping to promote inclusion and diversity across Irish society.  The Migrant Integration Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 is one such strategy.</p>  <p>  The Migrant Integration Strategy runs until the end of 2020 and targets all migrants who are legally in the State. It contains 76 actions which are delivered by Government Departments, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs across a number of policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including employment; education and social inclusion. It also addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach.   </p>  <p>  There are a number of funding streams available to support the integration of migrants.</p>  <p>  - My Department administers a National Funding Programme to promote the Integration of migrants, which has 15 projects located throughout Ireland. Grants totalling almost &euro;2 million (&euro;1,987,890) are spread over three years to support the implementation of these projects.  A call for applications under the National Integration Fund 2020 was launched on 11 August 2020 with funding of almost &euro;2.2 million available over a three year period.  The Fund will support communities to promote the integration of migrants and their children into Irish society and selected projects will help to combat racism and xenophobia. The closing date for applications under this fund was 22 September 2020 and applications are now being assessed.</p>  <p>  - In addition, the Communities Integration Fund support local initiatives. There were 125 successful applications from 25 counties who received grants of up to &euro;5,000 under the 2019 Fund.  Applications for the 2020 Communities Integration Fund have been assessed and 114 projects have been successful.  The 2020 Fund also has total funding of &euro;500,000 available for these projects.</p>  <p>  - The Funds Administration Unit of my Department administers larger grants and those for multi-annual projects using funding from European sources, including the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). The 2019 AMIF allocation provided funding of &euro;4,487,919 to 19 projects - 4 of which operate nationwide.  There are also 4 operating in Dublin, 2 in Cork, and 1 each  in Monaghan, Kildare, Meath,1 in Kildare, 1 in Meath, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Waterford, Mayo and Kerry.</p>  <p>  - The 2019 European Social Fund (ESF) allocation provided funding of &euro;3,288,498 to 5 projects. Two of the projects operate nationwide and the others were located in Dublin, Meath and Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  The number of persons interacting with these services is not currently available to my Department.</p></reply>

Ireland was ranked 7th in the EU-28 on the European Institute for Gender Equality's 2019 Gender Equality Index which is based on data from 2017. Between 2005 and 2017, Ireland&rsquo;s score increased by 9.4 points (+ 1.8 points since 2015), showing faster progress towards gender equality than other EU Member States. Ireland has shown greatest improvement since 2005 in improving gender balance in leadership, reflecting the initiatives undertaken to improve the gender balance in politics, the Civil Service, academia, publicly listed boards, research funding organisations and publically owned broadcasting organisations.  </p>  <p>  My Department now coordinates the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020. The strategy includes measures advanced by the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, to promote gender balance in higher education leadership. High level targets for the implementation of the recommendations of the 2016 HEA Gender Equality report and the 2018 Gender Taskforce Action Plan are included in the new System Performance Framework for Higher Education Institutions launched in 2018.</p></reply>

This system has improved the quality, safety, responsiveness and delivery of child protection services by supporting social workers in their  practice, and capturing critical data on children who are the subject of a child protection or welfare referral. This information service allows for the provision of a timely, robust and effective information that  captures details of screening, preliminary enquiries, assessments (initial or other) and case notes.  As part of the implementation of the NCCIS the IT equipment for staff was upgraded and made fit for purpose. </p>  <p>  Managers at local, area, regional and national level can now access real time data on the management of referrals and open cases, and can indemnify, at an early stage anomalies in service delivery.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has a Data and Analytics team and a  Quality and Assurance Team. These teams produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. These reports are published on Tusla's website.  Tusla also reports regularly on children in care, their placement type, care status, allocation of social workers and other relevant areas. These reports are reviewed by Officials and inform performance oversight including staffing and resource challenges. Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. The reports are also available to HIQA to inform their monitoring responsibilities. </p>  <p>  Tusla have also introduced an online data hub where other agencies, researchers and the public can access aggregated non-personal information that Tusla produces. Tusla's Quality and Assurance team and their Data and Analytics team look at the metrics being produced, the work underway in Tusla and continually explore additional options for expanding or improving reporting.</p></reply>

Proper coordination of service provision to children at risk is a core component of the response to risk mitigation and care for these children. The Child and Family Agency Tusla plays a significant role in the coordination of services.  </p>  <p>  In 2017 Tusla adopted the national approach to practice, Signs of Safety, which applies to intra-familial child protection and welfare cases whereby Tusla work closely with parents and extended family, around the alleged risk and harm posed to  children.  Safety Plans are formulated with parents, children and the safety network around them, to mitigate such risk and harm. The Signs of Safety approach is relationship based with a focus on safety and is supported by evidence in child protection practice. </p>  <p>  The Prevention, Partnership and Family Support (PPFS) is another programme that Tusla developed to ensure coordinated supports at a preventive level. The aim of the programme is to prevent risks to children and young people arising or escalating by enabling Tusla and partner organisations to engage effectively at an early stage. </p>  <p>  Within the PPFS programme Tusla has developed the Meitheal approach to help children where they may need the support of more than one service. Meitheal is a case co-ordination process which families may agree to agencies sharing information in order to provide a better coordinated service. </p>  <p>  Tusla social workers work with their colleagues in the  Tusla Education Support Services to align provision to maximise supports for children at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  Children First outlines the Joint Working Protocol between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Each agency manages the responsibility within its brief and their joint efforts are designed to ensure that the protection and welfare of children receives priority attention. A Liaison Team oversees the interagency relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, ensuring communication is maintained and that each reported child protection and welfare concern receives an appropriate response.</p>  <p>  As a critical service provider of essential frontline services for children and families, Tusla has been focused on ensuring continuity of supports and services while also balancing the needs and best interests of the child with public health advice to keep children, families and frontline staff as safe as possible during the pandemic. As the current public health crisis evolves, Tusla will continue to provide a service.</p></reply>

In this funding package, Government committed to a reopening support payment, a Covid-19 capital grant, continued access to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), and resumption of my Department's ELC and SAC funding schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of the July stimulus package ELC and SAC services now have access to the Revenue-operated Employment Wage Subsidy scheme (EWSS), which funds up to &euro;200 per week per staff member. This funding is now secured until 31 March next and I will continue to work to ensure that the needs of the sector are recognised in any reforms of the scheme thereafter. A special exemption for ELC services to the 30% turnover rule within EWSS has been included to recognise the need to retain capacity in the sector and support parents to access childcare places and get back to work.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need for improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in ELC and SAC services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. The most recent data available indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019. This rate is higher than the "living wage" of &euro;12.30, although I acknowledge that approximately 60% of staff earn less than this wage.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. However, wages in the sector remain too low. As a significant funder of the sector, alongside parents, it is imperative that my Department works with provider representatives and staff representatives to address the issue.</p>  <p>  In the medium-term, work that is currently under way to develop a new Funding Model and a Workforce Development Plan may provide new mechanisms by which the State can improve pay and working conditions in the sector. However, I am also keen to take further steps in the short-term that could support pay and working conditions. The Programme for Government commits to establish a Joint Labour Committee for the sector, with a view to developing an Employment Regulation Order.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.1209.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000098#WRY03000"><p>I have secured a total of &euro;638million for Early Learning and Childcare programmes and initiatives next year, despite the particularly challenging circumstances surrounding Budget 2021. In addition, I have secured access for the sector to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme with a critical exemption to the turnover rule. This is worth &euro;60m to the sector for the first 3 months of the year. It is important to note that the sector received a quite unique and extensive range of supports in 2020 which is estimated at &euro;180m above and beyond the childcare budget in place. This is indicative of the value and importance of this sector to me, my Department and to Government.</p>  <p>  In 2020, and for at least part of 2021, a primary focus of my Department has been, and will be, on sustaining the ELC and SAC sector. We have kept services open through supporting them with the additional costs associated with following public health guidance, the cost of lower occupancy, and through encouraging greater uptake of childcare places.</p>  <p>  As such, the key new contributor to the ELC and SAC sector in 2021 is the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme which funds up to &euro;200 per week, per staff member. This funding in now secured until March 31 and I will continue to work to ensure that the needs of the sector are recognised in any reforms of the scheme thereafter.</p>  <p>  A second key contributor to the sector in 2021 will be to encourage more parents to access safe and more affordable early learning and childcare services. Due to COVID, we have witnessed a reduction in demand for childcare in 2020 in terms of numbers and hours. Despite this, I have retained all funding in Budget 2021, meaning that there is funding available for up to 20,000 new families to join the National Childcare Scheme and access subsidies of up to &euro;200 per child, per week. There is also funding available in 2021 for existing families in receipt of the NCS or other schemes, now on lower income as a result of COVID, to receive higher subsidies.</p>  <p>  I look forward to building on these developments in 2021 when I receive the report of the Expert Group which is developing a new Funding Model   and also when the Workforce Development Plan is completed.</p></reply>

Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p>  <p>  Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians is provided, can candidates who are under 23 be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address, Article 21(3) (b) of the Scheme refers. Otherwise he or she is assessed as a dependent student for student grant purposes, i.e. assessed on the basis of the income and address of parents/legal guardians. </p>  <p>  The assessment of a case of estrangement is carefully considered to ensure there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances pertaining in such cases genuinely exists. Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and almost always will involve exceptional circumstances unique to a particular family situation. The scheme does not stipulate precisely how an awarding authority satisfies itself that such circumstances prevail. This is to allow the awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess the evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each individual case. The type of documentary evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  SUSI, the grant awarding authority, has advised that the student in question applied for student grant assistance on 8th May 2020 and declared that his sister was his legal guardian. SUSI requested evidence of legal guardianship but his sister had not been appointed as his legal guardian. As the student was under the age to be assessed as an independent mature student SUSI then wrote to the student to request evidence of estrangement from his parents. The student was advised by SUSI that accepted evidence of estrangement can include a letter from a Social Worker/TUSLA confirming estrangement or a Court Order. The student was also advised that other documentary evidence could be submitted but must specifically confirm irreconcilable estrangement from his parents. The grant awarding authority could not accept an affidavit from the student or his sister as evidence of his estrangement as it would not be independent documentary evidence of estrangement for the purposes of the grant scheme.</p>  <p>  The student did not submit the required evidence of estrangement and cancelled his application for student grant assistance on 25th September 2020.  The student would have had a statutory right to appeal the decision of the awarding authority if he had proceeded with his application.</p>  <p>  SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. The closing date for receipt of late applications by SUSI is 5th November, 2020.  The student may still submit a student grant application as a dependent student before the closing date.</p></reply>

The key objective of this group was to develop a plan to develop a sustainable future for the Mayo Campus arising from concerns about the financial viability of the campus.  The Governing Authority of GMIT in consultation with the HEA have responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations of the report to promote the future sustainability of the Mayo Campus as an integral part of GMIT in the North West Region.  The Report contained 33 recommendations for implementation and a status report on the recommendations in tabular form is attached.</p><p>Terms of reference for the mid-term review have been approved by the HEA and Mazars have been appointed as the independent assessor for the review.  The report of the independent assessor will be presented to the HEA&rsquo;s Finance and Governance Committee by the end of Q1 2021.  </p><p>I can confirm that Professor Neville McClenaghan took up the post of Vice-President GMIT Mayo Campus in February 2019.</p><p>One of the key recommendations was the establishment of a sub-committee of the Governing Body of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) to oversee the management and development of the Mayo Campus.  This sub-committee was established in early 2018 and has given campus issues more focus from a governance perspective and also facilitated the involvement of regional stakeholders.  </p><p>The Mayo Campus is a regular item on the agenda of the Governing Body of GMIT, the following are some significant items recently addressed by the Governing Body:</p><p>- A Strategic Framework for the Mayo campus approved by Governing body</p><p>- Report form Mayo Campus Subcommittee</p><p>- Presentation by the President Dr. Orla Flynn on the Strategic Framework.</p><p>- Approval of revised Terms of Reference for Mayo Campus Subcommittee.</p><p>In addition the Mayo Campus is a regular item for discussion at the Governing body Finance Subcommittee and the Audit &amp;amp; Risk Committee.  The Mayo Sub Committee of the GMIT Governing Body has met on 16 occasions since the publication of the report.</p><p>GMIT submits discrete budgetary reports on the Mayo Campus to the HEA.  The Mayo campus is a standing item on meetings between GMIT and the HEA; the CEO of the HEA met with the President of GMIT in June 2020 at which the campus was discussed.</p><p>At the time of publication of the report in 2017, overall expenditure in the Mayo campus was estimated at c.&euro;2.4m over income.  While implementation of the plan will assist in the reduction the deficit incurred by the Mayo campus, the plan will naturally take time to come to fruition.  Interim ring-fenced funding of &euro;750,000 per annum for five years was awarded to support the costs of the Mayo campus for a fixed time period as the plan is implemented and as the campus hopefully moves to a more financially sustainable position. Additionally GMIT receives ring-fenced funding annually under the HEA&rsquo;s Multi-campus funding initiative. </p><p>My Department also provided &euro;2m in funding arising from the recommendations to provide building works on the Mayo campus which is a strong demonstration of the commitment to its future development and growth. </p><p>I have been assured that GMIT is fully committed to multi-disciplinary provision at its Mayo campus and this includes business, but is also examining opportunities arising from the growing critical mass and expertise on the campus in health care and wellbeing to protect the future sustainability of the campus. </p><p>I am also assured that the Mayo campus of GMIT is an integral part of the Institute with the development and success of the Mayo campus a priority for the Governing Body and executive leadership of GMIT. </p><p>Given its location and hinterland alongside that of IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT &ndash; GMIT&rsquo;s partners in the Connaught Ulster Alliance consortium in establishment of a proposed multi-campus Technological University spanning the West and North West &ndash; the development and success of the Mayo campus remains a priority for the Governing Body and executive leadership of GMIT.  The creation of a Technological University by the Connaught Ulster Alliance will provide enormous opportunities for all stakeholders in the region, including those in Mayo. </p><p>I understand GMIT, following engagement with Mayo campus staff over an extended period, is undertaking a strategic reorganisation process as part a critical element of the transformation process required to realise these benefits from TU designation.  </p><p>I also understand the GMIT President has confirmed that the intention of this process is to enhance offerings and services, not diminish them.  I am very supportive of the continued success of the Mayo Campus as part of the future of GMIT and progression towards TU designation.  </p><p>It is vital for GMIT and the future TU to offer an integrated service to all stakeholders working across the region and acting as one.  All GMIT schools are intended to have a GMIT-wide remit including Mayo, Galway and beyond. The strategic re-positioning of GMIT now underway encompasses the commitment to ensure the long-term sustainability and future development of the Mayo Campus. </p></reply>

Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. The closing date for receipt of late applications by SUSI is 5th November, 2020.  Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, <i>www.susi.ie</i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.</p><p>The issue of paid placement for student nurses is a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE. My Department has no role in this matter.  Any student in receipt of a maintenance grant who takes part in a placement as part of their course continues to receive payment of a their maintenance grant while on that placement. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that in July I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>The &euro;168m funding package also includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. </p><p>As announced as part of Budget 2021 we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund for students to mitigate against the impacts of the changed learning environment. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for student shortly.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

These actions plans will involve the implementation of systems that record the number of incidents of bullying, intimidation or harassment including sexual harassment. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has oversight of the Framework for Consent in HEIs, and these statistics will be reported annually to the HEA once the action plans in each institution are in place.</p>  <p>  I have also requested that a survey be undertaken on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying of both staff and students in the higher education institutions. The planning of this survey has commenced, and the HEA is consulting with the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all staff and students in our Higher Education Institutions, and the steps I am undertaking, I believe, will contribute significantly to the realisation of this objective.</p></reply>

In this regard earlier this year, I secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. </p>  <p>  This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and re-opening of our higher education institutions. This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc. </p>  <p>  I understand that many institutions are already in the process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, and more to follow over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority, assisted by a broad range of stakeholders, including the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, USI, Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland, and my Department prepared a National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which was published on 10 October 2020. The Framework recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling services will allow for the development of active outreach to students, and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.   </p>  <p>  In recent weeks I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a free, 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution's keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students.  Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. The 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances where further support is required. </p></reply>

The CAO processes applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs. Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system works on the basis that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, and I appreciate how disappointing it can be for a student not to receive an offer for their course of choice, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place, there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.</p></reply>

Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is Ireland&rsquo;s largest competitive funding agency. SFI is committed to building this capacity in 2021 by continuing to place a priority on maintaining a balanced portfolio which places an emphasis on early and advanced research careers, frontiers/discovery and applied research, research projects that are led by individuals and small groups as well as large scale research centres.</p>  <p>  The SFI Research Infrastructure (RI) call was launched in February 2018. A major objective of the call was to support the research community in building and sustaining the required infrastructure capacity to accomplish high quality, high impact and innovative STEM research. SFI has awarded close to &euro;38m in funding under this programme since 2018. This significant investment will see new infrastructure and equipment coming on stream which will benefit our national capabilities for years to come. </p>  <p>  The expansion of Tyndall National Institute (TNI), a partnership between the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and University College Cork, is identified as a strategic investment priority in Project Ireland 2040. TNI operates at the cutting edge of ICT research and has reached capacity at its current facility in Cork &ndash; limiting further growth in researcher numbers, industry engagement, collaborative R&amp;D and its extension into new areas of &ldquo;deep technology&rdquo; which will be critical to Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise development in areas such as cybersecurity, AI, quantum computing, photonics and materials. The TNI expansion plans will double both its size and capacity over the next decade and expand TNI&rsquo;s role as a leading global ICT research institute. </p>  <p>  Work is also underway in my Department to develop the successor strategy to Innovation 2020, Ireland's strategy for research and development, science and technology. This new strategy will once again be a whole-of-Government strategy. I expect the strategy to set out a vision that will ensure we prioritise investing in RDI as key to addressing our economic and social challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health. It will also focus on addressing the cross-cutting issues that are essential for maintaining a well-functioning, fit for purpose RDI system capable of addressing these challenges, including a focus on the research infrastructure needed to achieve this. The Strategy will be accompanied by an ambitious work programme across Government to deliver on our common goals.</p></reply>

The agency has invested over &euro;100m in 6 SFI Centres for Research Training. The 6 SFI Centres for Research Training will provide training for over 700 postgraduate students (over a lifetime of 7.5 years) in the areas of Machine Learning, Digitally Enhanced Reality, Foundations of Data Science, Genomics Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Network for Sustainable Societies. Students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces and making them a very attractive skills pipeline for industry. </p>  <p>  The role of ICT in health and healthcare is increasingly critical. Many of the highly skilled graduates from these 6 SFI Centres for Research Training may well emerge with skills of relevance to areas of medical science. Of particular note is the SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science which is hosted by the National University of Ireland, Galway. This SFI Centre for Research Training will produce a cohort of highly trained scientists capable of engaging effectively with the data science challenges involved in realising the transformative potential of genomics across the broad range of its applications.</p>  <p>  Both research and innovation are needed to power Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy and create a sustainable, competitive, and more broadly-based economy which will be resilient to future challenges and address important societal needs. SFI has developed a suite of dynamic funding programmes which facilitate industry/academic collaboration. These funding programmes enable companies and academics to work together on specific programmes of research to address industry needs, support technology transfer and grow skills and expertise. The network of 16 SFI Research Centres, which are part of our higher education institutions, are a critical part of this landscape, and through their reputation as homes of world class research and training attract and retain foreign direct investment in Ireland, and help grow indigenous industry, with research excellence and global thought leadership at their core. One example is FutureNeuro, the SFI Research Centre for Chronic and Rare Neurological Diseases which is hosted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The Centre conducts research in the thematic areas of diagnostics, therapeutics and eHealth for chronic and rare neurological diseases. FutureNeuro is already attracting industry attention and is working with partners such as Roche, Janssen and Microsoft.</p>  <p>  SFI&rsquo;s annual plan of funding programmes is designed to ensure that the agency maintains a balanced portfolio which places an emphasis on early and advanced research careers, frontiers/discovery and applied research, research projects that are led by individuals and small groups as well as large scale research centres. These programmes, such as the SFI Frontiers for the Future Programme ensure that we are training PhD students in areas of fundamental science which will be the foundations upon which innovations and economic competitiveness can grow in the future.</p></reply>

However, it is incumbent upon the institutions to have in place proper policies and procedures which provide a mechanism for staff and students to resolve any grievances and complaints they may have with regard to college life. </p>  <p>  Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life.</p>  <p>  On 4 August 2020 I wrote to the Presidents of all publicly funded higher education institutions (HEIs) requesting that all HEIs develop and publish, by February 2021, specific institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. These actions plans will involve the implementation of systems that record the number of incidents of bullying, intimidation or harassment including sexual harassment reported in each HEI. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has oversight of the Framework for Consent in HEIs, and these statistics will be reported annually to the HEA once the HEI action plans are in place.</p>  <p>  I have also requested that a survey be undertaken on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying of both staff and students in the higher education institutions. The planning of this survey has commenced, and the HEA is consulting with the HEIs representative bodies, the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all staff and students in our Higher Education Institutions, and the steps I am undertaking, I believe, will contribute significantly to this.</p></reply>

There is no indication that a higher number of students than usual are opting to defer their place to the 2021 academic year, and given the large numbers of students who have been accommodated in higher education this year it is feasible that the numbers of students reapplying to the CAO next year on the basis of Leaving Certificate results from prior years will be lower in 2021 than previously.</p>  <p>  We will continue to build on the progress made this year in expanding higher education provision, and &euro;18 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places from September 2021.  This increase will address demographic growth pressures and equates to an overall investment of nearly &euro;80 million to address the demographic increases since 2018. These places are in addition to the 1,330 additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free or 90% funded upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills needs. Under Springboard+ 2020, 11,074 places are being provided on 332 courses. This includes additional places as a response to Covid-19 related skills needs, funded through a repurposing of a small element of the HCI Pillar 3 allocation, and further additional places funded through the July Jobs Stimulus package. An additional &euro;7m has been provided for Springboard+ under the 2021 Budget, however the exact number of places to be provided will be determined during the course of the 2021 Springboard+ call for proposals.</p>  <p>  Over 2,000 additional places will be provided across a range of existing part-time and full-time postgraduate taught programmes at post graduate certificate to Masters level, funded through the July Stimulus package. </p>  <p>  These courses will address skills needs and be complementary to, but broader than the Springboard+/HCI Pillar 1 offering. They will serve not only the requirements of the new economic model envisaged by the Programme for Government but also specific economic and social needs arising from COVID19.</p>  <p>  Courses will be open to returners to the workforce, those in employment and recent graduates. All participants, with the exception of returners, will contribute 10% of the course cost. Part time courses will be available to those in receipt of DEASP payments, who will not pay any course fee.</p>  <p>  My Department will monitor the situation as it develops and take action as necessary to ensure the availability of a full range of further and higher education options this year and in future years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has been made in the 2020/2021 academic year on the necessary increase in third level places to meet current and projected demand, and Budget 2021 will greatly facilitate us in continuing this progress in the next academic year. </p></reply>

Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Therefore application and offer data is held by the CAO, not by my Department.</p>  <p>  According to data released by the CAO, there were a total of 78,168 applicants this year, up marginally from 77,706 applicants last year. 24,458 applicants received an offer for a first preference Level 8 course, and 28,677 applicants received an offer for a first preference Level 7/6 course in Round One of the CAO offer process this year, the latest round for which this data is available. This compares to 23,129 first preference Level 8 offers and 27,274 first preference Level 7/6 Offers in 2019.</p>  <p>  These figures are from Round One only and do not include first preference offers received by applicants in Round A and Round Zero of the CAO offer process. Round A and Round Zero are in respect of deferred applicants, mature applicants and some graduate entry pathways. 12,443 offers were made during these rounds in 2020, and data on how many of these were first preference offers is not held by my Department. </p></reply>

From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge need to be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential.</p>  <p>  The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad. </p>  <p>  Work is now underway in my Department to develop the successor strategy to Innovation 2020. I expect the strategy to set out a vision that will ensure we prioritise investing in RDI as key to addressing our economic and social challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health. It will also focus on addressing the cross-cutting issues that are essential for maintaining a well-functioning, fit for purpose RDI system capable of addressing these challenges. Critical to this is ensuring we have a pipeline of talent coming through our higher education system that is fully equipped to make a valuable contribution to our economy and society.</p></reply>

The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally on the same basis to both employed and self-employed applicants. No allowances can be made for outgoings, e.g. mortgage repayments.</p><p>The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households. </p><p>The calculation of reckonable income is set out in Article 22(3) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020.  The income considered by SUSI, the centralised student grant awarding authority, is income from all sources, whether it arises in the State or not, including maintenance payments.  </p><p>Article 21(2) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020 states that where a dependent student's parents are divorced or legally separated, or it is established to the satisfaction of SUSI, the grant awarding authority that they are separated, the income to be assessed is that of the student and the parent with whom she/he resides.  </p><p>The treatment of maintenance payments is as follows: </p><p>In cases where one parent/legal guardian has custody of the child, the awarding authority SUSI will take that income, together with the maintenance payments paid by the other parent/guardian, into account.</p><p>If the parent who has custody of the child pays maintenance to support a spouse living separately, these payments are deducted in computing the reckonable income of the parent maintaining the child.</p><p>In cases where joint custody exists, the income of both parents/guardians is taken into account. </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter in the first instance for the grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI). </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.</p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via <i>www.studentgrantappeals.ie</i>. </p><p>I want to look strategically at the wide range of issues related to the SUSI scheme, and that is why I recently announced plans to review the scheme. It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020, and will report in Summer 2021. Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process. The amount allocated to SUSI in any given year will continue to depend on the annual Estimates cycle, but it is my intention that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p><p>As announced as part of Budget 2021 we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund for students to mitigate against the impacts of the changed learning environment. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for student shortly.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Queries in relation to the overall expenditure on Higher Education in relation to the national budget are more appropriate for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p><b>Government Funding for Higher Education: </b></p><p>In recent Government funding has demonstrably increased in the period 2016 to 2020 with increased planned investment in Higher Education, an increase of 25% compared to 2016 &ndash; an amount in the order of an additional &euro;370 million bringing the total funding for the sector in 2020 to &euro;1.87 billion (up from &euro;1.5 billion in 2016).</p><p>In terms of Government funding the immediate matter to consider is that the delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less. In 2020 the Government has provided additional funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education. A further &euro;47.5m is also being provided in 2020 to provide additional skills courses as part of the July stimulus programme.  </p><p>Through Budget 2021<b></b>the Government has responded to the significant challenges including support to meet demographic needs including support of Leaving Certificate 2020 students, investing in access measures and building capacity to mitigate educational disadvantage, investing in research and skills as well as capital infrastructure.</p><p>The funding package from Budget 2021 includes:</p><p>-  A &euro;50 million fund to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on this group</p><p>-  &euro;120 million to reskill and upskill people affected by the pandemic</p><p>-  Supporting a green recovery by rolling out a new retrofitting training scheme and a new climate action upskilling scheme.</p><p>-  50,000 further education and training places in 2020/2021;</p><p>-  Extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme;</p><p>-  Nearly &euro;30 million will be invested in research to support researchers, build capacity, support Covid research, and strengthen north-south research links;</p><p>-  Enhanced SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increased support for the PATH access initiative to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students.</p><p>-  A review of SUSI to guide the future strategic direction of the scheme;</p><p>-  Funding will be provided to sustain additional places in higher education and further increase Springboard places;</p><p>-  Infrastructure investments to expand student places, upgrade existing infrastructure, modernise apprenticeship provision and progress the digital agenda;</p><p>-  &euro;15 million is being provided for minor capital works and equipment for higher education institutions.</p><p><b>Student Supports:</b></p><p>In terms of costs for students, the fees payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education.</p><p>Under the Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with students paying the student contribution. It is important to note in relation to this issue that under the Free Fees Schemes the Exchequer currently makes a very substantial contribution amounting to &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with those students who are required to pay the student contribution paying &euro;3,000 per annum towards the cost of their studies.  The last increase to the student contribution was in 2014/15. The State pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees. </p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding, they pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution. </p><p>The principal support provided by the Department in financial terms is the Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. Additional supports include the Student Assistance Fund, Programme for Access to Higher Education and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware as part of Budget 2021, I announced enhanced SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increased support for the PATH access initiative to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students and a review of SUSI to guide the future strategic direction of the scheme. An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. Government has made available &euro;50 million in funding to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on this group was included in Budget 2021. My officials and I are developing proposals for the utilisation of this funding for submission to Government prior to commencement. </p><p>This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education.</p><p><b>Higher Education Funding Reform: </b></p><p>Furthermore the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education.  The future development of Ireland as an inclusive society and a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options including the existing student contribution and other supports.  </p><p>Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future funding which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability. </p><p>All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of the Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further education.</p></reply>

As providers, it is the responsibility of each higher education institution (HEI) to put in place appropriate supports to ensure that the needs of students of disabilities are met. Each HEI has an access and disability service in place to support students with disabilities. Students who feel that they may require supports from their institution should contact the access or disability service who will carry out a needs assessment in collaboration with the student. These supports will continue to be provided, as appropriate, where any online or blended learning takes place.</p>  <p>  The Fund Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. This supports the overall goals of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. In 2019 funding of &euro;9.6m was allocated to the FSD (covering both the higher education and further education sectors as well as Irish students studying in the UK and EU). FSD currently supports circa 14,500 students with disabilities The type of supports covered include:</p>  <p>  -  Assistive technology;</p>  <p>  -  Non-medical helpers;</p>  <p>  -  Academic/learning support;</p>  <p>  -  Deaf supports;</p>  <p>  -  Transport supports.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. To ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education, the majority of college will be online for this semester and as a result a Once-Off COVID-19 Grant (&euro;15m) to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices is part of the package of COVID-19 supports for higher and further education institutions funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The devices will be distributed by the relevant Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) via appropriate lending schemes.  The education institutions are best placed to determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In determining distribution of the devices, HEIs are required to have regard to the target groups, including students with disabilities, identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021. HEIs and ETBs must be satisfied that students who receive a device under this grant have demonstrated a verifiable need for such a device e.g. they or their family do not have the means to purchase such a device themselves. Students should contact their HEI access office for further information.</p>  <p>  This package also includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students including those with disabilities. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  An additional measure to support full time third level students is the provision of financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Once finalised the details will be available for students.</p></reply>

All female prisoners, whether they are committed to the D&oacute;chas Centre or to Limerick Prison, are interviewed by the Governor who will ask a number of relevant security questions which help determine the level of risk, if any, posed to the prisoner or by the prisoner to others. </p>  <p>  Prisoners are then assessed by healthcare staff and the prison doctor.  A multi-disciplinary approach is taken in the future management of the prisoner's sentence, including the prison best suited to the needs and safety of the prisoner and that of the wider prison community.  Many women in the custody of the Service are vulnerable and the Service continues to engage with external stakeholders with regard to their safety and their level of risk and needs, including engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Incentivised Regimes Policy operates in all prisons and provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and level of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure custody for all prisoners.  The D&oacute;chas Centre has a number of houses with various levels of security depending on the level of the Incentivised Regime that the women are currently on.  Positive behaviour is rewarded by progression to the enhanced level which provides access to higher levels of privileges including increased visits, phone calls and access to temporary release programmes.</p>  <p>  At all times members of staff are vigilant and report any areas of concern that may come to their attention. </p>  <p>  Restorative Justice is practised in the D&oacute;chas Centre through a number of qualified staff to help manage any conflict that might arise and weekly Multi Agency Meetings are held to discuss particular issues of concern.</p>  <p>  Prisoner safety is paramount to the Irish Prison Service and under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007, a prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.  If necessary, under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules, the Governor may decide for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that prisoner may have on the general population. </p>  <p>  Disciplinary action is taken by management against any prisoner who breaches Prison Rules by engaging in bullying or intimidating behaviour or who is violent towards any other person.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Irish Prison Service has also successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.</p></reply>

They are given a priority appointment with law centre staff or referred to a  private practitioner as soon as possible after their application for legal aid is received.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Solicitors Panel, which is provided by the Legal Aid Board, plays an important role in providing legal assistance to people making an application for international protection and permission to remain in the State.  Solicitors on the Panel provide a range of legal services including assistance with the international protection questionnaire and interview and representation at the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  The service provided by private solicitors on the Board&rsquo;s panel is intended to be the same service that is provided by a law centre.</p>  <p>  Last year, the former Minister for Justice and Equality approved changes to the terms and conditions of the Panel, including a restructuring of fees paid to solicitors.  These changes were requested by the Legal Aid Board to take into account practical considerations that had arisen in relation to the operation of the panel, reflecting the Board's experience since the International Protection Act 2015 came into force, and legal developments in the interim.  These changes were not occasioned by a reduction in the budget for the Legal Aid Board.  They are due to come into effect shortly.  These new terms and conditions will not result in delays in the provision of legal services and applicants will continue to receive the same high level of legal assistance. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Legal Aid Board considers that for 2020 and 2021 it has been sufficiently resourced to meet on a priority basis projected demand for legal services for international protection applicants.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on civil legal aid services and advice provided to international protection applicants can be found here:</p>  <p>www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/services-for-international-protection-applicants/. </p>  <p>  As announced in the Budget earlier this week, an increased provision of over &euro;2 million in 2021 will bring total funding of the Legal Aid Board to &euro;44.6 million, a 6% increase.  This will enable the Board to recruit additional staff and meet other costs to enhance delivery of its services across the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.1363.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000101#WRBB01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 528 together.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that to date only four prisoners have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.  Each positive case was a recently committed prisoner from the community and none of the cases have been acquired within the prison environment. </p><p>I am advised that the Irish Prison Service has put in place an extensive range of measures to prevent Covid-19 transmission within prisons.  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service at an early stage established an Emergency Response Planning Team (&ldquo;ERPT&rdquo;) consisting of senior staff with skills and experience in areas including operational; healthcare; and infection control.  The ERPT was tasked with identifying and issuing instruction for any necessary actions with the aim of:</p><p>-  Blocking the spread of Covid-19 in a prison setting;</p><p>-  Early detection of any possible case of Covid-19 in a prisoner or staff member; and</p><p>-  Prevention of the spread of Covid-19, should a case be confirmed.  </p><p>The measures which have been introduced, guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation and guidance of the Council of Europe, include:</p><p>-  The introduction of a basic health check, including taking of temperatures for all persons, including staff, entering prisons since 29 March; </p><p>-  The ongoing review of the provision of physical family visits, replaced by the introduction of video visits in line with local county restrictions on movement;  </p><p>-  In conjunction with the HSE, facilitating the testing of all new committals to the prisons at an early stage, which will allow for the prisoner to exit quarantine and enter the general population at an earlier stage, provided test results are negative; </p><p>-  Isolation of suspected case or prisoner with symptoms to prevent the risk of transmission of infection; </p><p>-  The provision of cocooned accommodation for vulnerable prisoners including all prisoners aged 70 years or more or those that are deemed medically vulnerable; </p><p>-  Comprehensive training for IPS staff and the provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across the prison estate; </p><p>-  Conducting of risk assessments and putting in additional controls where identified, such as the mandatory wearing of surgical masks for staff in areas which have been highlighted as locations where social distancing is difficult or cannot be maintained; </p><p>-  A number of Standard Operating Procedures in place for the distribution of PPE, as well as the donning and doffing of PPE and Infection Control measures which are kept under consent review; </p><p>-  Strong communication with staff and prisoners, including two prison newsletters published weekly and regular Covid-19 information leaflets for prisoners and newsletters for staff regarding actions taken; and </p><p>-  Establishment of a robust contract tracing model which has been acknowledged by the World Health Organisation as best practice. </p><p>The successful strategy employed by the Irish Prison Service to control the risks arising during this pandemic has been founded on detailed contingency planning providing for flexibility and a rapid response to continually evolving risks as well as the co-operation and understanding of all concerned, including both staff and prisoners. </p><p>I understand that the Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.  In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, the National Public Health Emergency Team and the HSE. The Service has a Prison Framework for Restrictive Measures of activities and regimes which is in line with the levels 1 to 5 measures under the National Framework for living with COVID 19 published by the Government last month.  </p><p>The ERPT is continually updating contingency plans.  These plans are, by their nature, highly operational and are subject to change given the multiple scenarios that are possible.  The Irish Prison Service continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders, in alignment with public health advice in the management of the response to the pandemic. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service has assured me that it is at all times cognisant of the impact of its decisions on people in custody.  This impact is taken into account at all times, including at every stage of the planning process and the implementing of actions necessary to control and mitigate against the risk of Covid-19 in the prison environment.</p></reply>

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.

The Visiting Committee to each of the current 12 prisons or places of detention is appointed under the Prison (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 as applied by section 4 of the Prisons Act, 1970.  Rules relating to the specific functions and operation of such Visiting Committees are set out in the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925.</p>  <p>  The function of Visiting Committees is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prisons to which they are appointed and to hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.  Visiting Committees have free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prisons.  They focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation, catering, medical, educational, welfare and recreational facilities.</p>  <p>  The above legislation provides that members of Prison Visiting Committees are to be responsible persons.  While at present there is no formal requirement for any specific qualifications in order to be considered for membership of a Prison Visiting Committee, generally speaking applicants have an interest in the wider criminal justice sector or related fields and have a desire to contribute to society.  Members of Prison Visiting Committees are drawn from a wide spectrum to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met.  All applications or expressions of interest with regard to membership of Prison Visiting Committees are examined individually.  Appointments to Prison Visiting Committees are generally for a period not exceeding three years and members can be considered for re-appointment.</p>  <p>  Appointments to Prison Visiting Committees are made by me, in my capacity as Minister, on foot of representations, either from local representatives or from individuals nominating themselves.  This is the long standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to Prisons Visiting Committees.</p>  <p>  Given the nature of the functions of Prison Visiting Committees, all applicants are subject to Garda clearance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to review the existing functions, powers, appointment procedures and reporting processes for Prison Visiting Committees.  Work in this regard has commenced in my Department.</p></reply>

This total allocation represents an increase of over 60% compared to the Inspectorate's 2020 budget, and over 290% when compared to 2019. </p>  <p>  Section 32 of the Prisons Act 2007 provides that the Inspector of Prisons shall submit a report to me as Minister, not later than 31 March in any year or such later date as may be specified by me, on the performance of the Inspector&rsquo;s functions during the previous year.  </p>  <p>  The Inspector has notified me that due to competing priorities and current resources, the inspector was not in a position to submit the report for 2019 within the specified timeframe. </p>  <p>  I hope to be in a position to publish the report for 2019 as soon as possible and as the Deputy may appreciate, the 2020 annual report will not be collated until year end.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee;</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.  As part of the application process the Local Authority must provide assurance that they will act in the data controller role.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in correspondence with the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the structure of the scheme as it relates to data protection.

It is recognised that community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate the worries and concerns of the population around continuity of medicine supply in the face of great uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The regulations to which the Deputy refers, were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and these were set to expire at the end of 2019.  It was therefore necessary for my predecessor to enact new legislation under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p>  <p>  The previous Government gave a commitment to commence a strategic review of the role of community pharmacists and to engage with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to develop revised contractual terms. It is my intention to honour that commitment as the existing GMS pharmacy contract is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training.</p>  <p>  The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p>  <p>  The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p>  <p>  The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p>  <p>  Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 7) Regulations 2020 (S.I.

The HSE began planning for the resumption of adult disability day services in May. A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders, including Inclusion Ireland, was convened and tasked with the development of a Resumption Plan. On May 31st the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published and the guidance to support this framework was published on July 8th.</p>  <p>  The guidance is to enable safe and person-centred disability day service supports to be provided in line with current public health advice and infection control guidance. It is not overly prescriptive in terms of detail as there is a wide diversity of disability in the 19,000 adults that received day service supports and day service locations vary enormously in size and capacity. Of this 19,000, approximately 5,000 people receive a day service as part of their residential placement.</p>  <p>  The key overarching elements of managing the risk of infection are:</p>  <p>  1.  Processes to identify people (service users and staff) with communicable infection (including COVID-19) before they access services/attend work or as soon as possible after they access services/attend work.</p>  <p>  2.  Processes to minimize the risk of spread of infection from people (service users and staff) who access services/attend for work with unrecognized infection (Standard Precautions).</p>  <p>  3.  Early detection of spread of infection in the service and immediate response to limit harm.</p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services also has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened through August and September, they re-opened at 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. The HSE also plan to capture the detail of the service being provided to each individual over the next few weeks, to get a better understanding of the quantum of service being provided.</p>  <p>  The investment of &euro;100 million in the Budget for people with a disability will build the capacity of our adult disability services and increase day services by one day a week, for those whose services were reduced due to COVID-19.  It will also support around 1,700 young people who leave school and training programmes in 2021.</p>  <p>  In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly, Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions also refers to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. With an annual budget of approximately &euro;45 million, and management of an investment portfolio of approximately &euro;200 million, the HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials, health services research, population health research, as well as managing a number of national health information systems on behalf of the Department.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HRB have incorporated COVID -19 related research into their work programmes and have already played an important role (among other agencies and the wider academic community) in providing research inputs to the various sub-groups of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). Therefore, increased research in this area is being funded through existing allocations. These significant resources are currently being employed in a number of research projects in the medical research community to respond to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  It is important to note also, that the HRB is collaborating with Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the wider research and innovation community to ensure a coordinated and meaningful contribution to solving some of the challenges presented during the current Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on behalf of the Irish Government, the Department of Health is providing funding of up to &euro;2.5 million to enable participation in the SOLIDARITY Trial. The SOLIDARITY Trial is an international clinical trial launched by the World Health Organisation and partners to compare various treatment options for COVID-19. The trial will enable the identification of treatments that will reduce the severity of the infection, decrease the need for intensive care and reduce the infection&rsquo;s mortality rate.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding evaluating requirements in respect of medical research nationally. The HRB monitoring and evaluation processes are delivered in three phases, guided by the Payback Framework and the HRB Evaluation Strategy for Funded Research 2017-2020. These processes evaluate the extent to which their funding is achieving their mission and delivering the intended benefits. The HRB is currently in the process of updating their evaluation strategy.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at  www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/.</p><p>Dance, yoga and gymnastics classes are regarded as exercise and sporting events under the Plan and where possible, such classes can be held online.</p><p>Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.</p><p>Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.</p><p>Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing.</p><p>Further information on exercise and sporting events under the Plan is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/resilience-and-recovery-plan-for-living-with-covid-19-your-questions-answered/#exercise-and-sporting-events and on Ireland Active at .</p></reply>

Cards that were due to expire during March and August 2020 were automatically extended for up to one year and will be re-assessed on a planned basis. This temporary measure was taken in the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to preserve necessary resources for emergency HSE Covid-19 responses and to also ensure continued eligibility for individuals during that unprecedented time in the health service.</p>  <p>  While the HSE PCERS have resumed eligibility reviews, it is important to note that where any medical or GP visit card holders has a review process initiated, he/she will continue to retain their eligibility for the duration of the review process. It is noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In relation to testing, the HSE has adopted PCR as the gold standard test for diagnosing Covid-19 cases, consistent with international best practice. While it is acknowledged that PCR testing does not offer 100% sensitivity or specificity, it is still regarded internationally as the most effective test currently available. In addition, the Department, the HSE and the NPHET are giving detailed and active consideration to alternative diagnostic approaches, including rapid antigen testing. HIQA recently completed a rapid Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in this regard and its findings will be used to inform the national testing strategy.</p>  <p>  In relation to data, while it is possible to distinguish if Covid-19 was determined to be a factor in the cause of death at present, it is not currently possible to break down cases with Covid-19 in hospitals by primary reason for hospitalisation. Work is however underway to enable collection of such data so that in future it should be possible to determine the number of hospital discharges where COVID-19 was the primary reason for the episode of care.</p>  <p>  More broadly, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government has published a strategy &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo; which sets out Ireland&rsquo;s approach to managing the pandemic for the next 6-9 months. The Plan includes a five-level framework of public health restrictive measures to respond to different stages of prevalence of the virus. However, the Strategy recognises that simple measures taken by everyone are the best defence against this disease and that no single measure works, what matters is the combination.</p>  <p>  We are at present in a very concerning position with a rapid deterioration over the last number of weeks in the incidence and severity of disease and Government is therefore considering all available options for bringing the disease back under control.</p></reply>

Vaccines will be administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years.</p>  <p>  The HSE has placed orders for 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine will be made available to all persons in an at-risk group from 6 months up. The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive. </p>  <p>  Following a delay in the delivery of the first batch of vaccines, the first deliveries of the QIV influenza vaccines to all sites (GPs, pharmacists, nursing homes etc.) started on 17th September, with deliveries continuing to all sites every two weeks.</p>  <p>  By the end of the second cycle of deliveries, in the week ending 9 October, approximately 800,000 doses of influenza vaccine were delivered to over 3,000 sites across the country. This represents an increase of 25% in quantities of vaccine delivered when compared with 2019. To date all sites have received 75% of the quantity used last season, and the allowance for the third delivery which began from 15th October will increase this to 90%. Further stocks will be available for the fourth round of deliveries.</p>  <p>  The HSE is satisfied that sufficient vaccine has been ordered to vaccinate all those in the HSE defined at-risk groups and all shipments will have arrived into Ireland before the end of October. The current distribution process to GP, pharmacists, hospitals and nursing homes will ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine to all target groups for vaccination around the country. </p>  <p>  Deliveries of the children&rsquo;s flu vaccine started on the 28th of September, and all of the total order of 600,000 doses is expected by mid-October, as planned.</p>  <p>  Those not covered by the publicly funded influenza vaccination programme can avail of influenza vaccination from GPs and pharmacists on a private basis. It is understood that stocks of vaccine for private administration are now being distributed. The Health Products Regulatory Authority Shortages Framework has not been informed of any influenza vaccine shortages affecting the Irish market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.1511.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000103#WRDD04300"><p>I am very much aware of how difficult the current situation is for families and their loved ones who are in long-term residential care. Continued social interaction is important and I fully appreciate the challenges that have been experienced in maintaining these interactions in a safe manner, especially with older people and those who are medically vulnerable. It is important that the right to have visitors is balanced with the need to ensure that visitations do not compromise overall resident care or adherence to requisite infection control procedures.</p>  <p>  Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the wellbeing of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p>  <p>  The Plan for Living with COVID-19 Framework has been developed to help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, with measures aimed at the key priorities of protecting health, strengthening employment, and supporting communities. A key aim of the Plan is to provide clarity on what restrictive measures are appropriate around the country based on the pattern and progress of COVID-19 in a particular area at a particular time.</p>  <p>  The system is communicated through a numbered system of alert Levels (from 1 to 5) with Level 1 being the lowest with the least amount of restrictive measures in place and Level 5 being the highest with the most restrictions in place.  Visits under the framework are; Level 1, open with protective measures in place, Level 2 open with enhanced protective measures and Levels 3 to 5 visits suspended, aside from critical and compassionate circumstances.  These Levels are applied to each county based on the current COVID-19 situation therein.</p>  <p>  In line with this Framework, new COVID-19 Guidance on Visitations to Residential Care Facilities has been developed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support residents, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living. This guidance is available on the HPSC website.  Guidance documents are reviewed regularly.</p>  <p>  The new guidance re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible. Crucially, the guidance also provides further clarity on visiting in critical and compassionate circumstances, which is a key issue for residents and families and the guidance should be referred to in making decisions with respect to visits.</p>  <p>  At present Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan are at level 4 with the remaining counties at level 3.  From midnight 21 October the country will move to level 5.  In accordance with these levels and in order to reduce resident contacts, visiting in long-term residential care facilities nationwide is suspended except in critical and compassionate circumstances.</p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  I encourage all nursing home providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing. It remains of critical importance that every nursing home provider takes steps and innovates to support ongoing communication between residents and their families and friends, even during periods of enhanced protective measures, while following public health advice.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-20a.1536.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102000104#WREE00700"><p>I am very much aware of how difficult the current situation is for families and their loved ones who are in long-term residential care. Continued social interaction is important and I fully appreciate the challenges that have been experienced in maintaining these interactions in a safe manner, especially with older people and those who are medically vulnerable. It is important that the right to have visitors is balanced with the need to ensure that visitations do not compromise overall resident care or adherence to requisite infection control procedures.</p>  <p>  Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the well-being of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p>  <p>  The Plan for Living with COVID-19 Framework has been developed to help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, with measures aimed at the key priorities of protecting health, strengthening employment, and supporting communities. A key aim of the Plan is to provide clarity on what restrictive measures are appropriate around the country based on the pattern and progress of COVID-19 in a particular area at a particular time.</p>  <p>  The system is communicated through a numbered system of alert Levels (from 1 to 5) with Level 1 being the lowest with the least amount of restrictive measures in place and Level 5 being the highest with the most restrictions in place.  Visits under the framework are; Level 1, open with protective measures in place, Level 2 open with enhanced protective measures and Levels 3 to 5 visits suspended, aside from critical and compassionate circumstances.  These Levels are applied to each county based on the current COVID-19 situation therein.</p>  <p>  In line with this Framework, new COVID-19 Guidance on Visitations to Residential Care Facilities has been developed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support residents, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living. This guidance is available on the HPSC website.  Guidance documents are reviewed regularly.</p>  <p>  The new guidance re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible. Crucially, the guidance also provides further clarity on visiting in critical and compassionate circumstances, which is a key issue for residents and families and the guidance should be referred to in making decisions with respect to visits.</p>  <p>  At present Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan are at level 4 with the remaining counties at level 3.  From midnight 21 October the country will move to level 5.  In accordance with these levels and in order to reduce resident contacts, visiting in long-term residential care facilities nationwide is suspended except in critical and compassionate circumstances.</p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  I encourage all nursing home providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and well-being. It remains of critical importance that every nursing home provider takes steps and innovates to support ongoing communication between residents and their families and friends, even during periods of enhanced protective measures, while following public health advice.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is a priority for the Minister and will be progressed as soon as possible, to support Farm Families and Businesses.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

This vaccine will be made available to all persons in an at-risk group from 6 months up, other than children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive. The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.   Children outside this age group in an at-risk category will also be eligible for vaccination without charges.  </p>  <p>  Following a delay in the delivery of the first batch of vaccines, the first deliveries of the QIV influenza vaccines to all sites (GPs, pharmacists, nursing homes etc.) started on 17th September.  </p>  <p>  By the end of the second cycle of deliveries, in the week ending 9 October, approximately 800,000 doses of influenza vaccine were delivered to over 3,000 sites across the country. This represents an increase of 25% in quantities of vaccine delivered when compared with 2019. To date all sites have received 75% of the quantity used last season, and the allowance for the third delivery  which began from 15th October will increase this to 90%. Further stocks will be available for the fourth round of deliveries.</p>  <p>  The HSE is satisfied that sufficient vaccine has been ordered to vaccinate all those in the HSE defined at-risk groups and all shipments will have arrived into Ireland before the end of October. The current distribution process to GP, pharmacists, hospitals and nursing homes will ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine to all target groups for vaccination around the country.  </p>  <p>   Deliveries of the children&rsquo;s flu vaccine started on the 28th of September, and all of the total order of 600,000 doses is expected by mid-October, as planned. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of significantly increasing the level of uptake of the vaccine for the coming winter, resources will be provided to GPs and pharmacists not only to deliver the vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. </p>  <p>  In addition, budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year as well as adding significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce. </p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

To support people with a disability, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;100 million is being provided for new disability measures next year under Budget 2021. These measures will include an additional 80,000 personal assistant hours.  The 2020 national service plan details that the HSE is seeking to deliver 1.67 million hours of Personal Assistant Hours to over 2,550 people.</p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities be allowed to live an independent life of their own choosing, the same as any other person, and this is consistent with the disability reform policy - &ldquo;transforming lives&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant (PA) services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.</p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. </p>  <p>  PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p></reply>

Many were old style institutions, with ten or more people. Some living in hospital ward or dormitory settings.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that Article 19(a) of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in 2018 by the Irish Government, states that people with disabilities should be able to choose where, and with whom, they live. </p><p>Time to move on is the governing strategy that seeks to ensure housing arrangements, including those moving from congregated settings, should be in ordinary neighbourhoods (dispersed housing) in the community, with individualised supports (supported living) designed to meet their individual needs and wishes. </p><p>It is about enabling people to &ldquo;live ordinary lives in ordinary places&rdquo;. At the end of 2019, there were circa 2,000 people remaining in congregated settings, while the majority 6,400 live in group homes in the community. 52 people have completed their transition so far this year, however It is likely that the impact of COVID-19 will be reflected in the year-end total.</p><p>Today, people are being supported to live lives of their choice out in the community. Several congregated settings have closed fully and many more have closed specific units within the centres.</p><p>Thoughtful planning, capacity building work with stakeholders and sharing the learning across services is enabling meaningful person-centred planning and transitions that are sustainable.</p><p>As the numbers in the large settings continues to fall, the people still remaining in these services have access to better living conditions and share with fewer people</p><p>While the pace of change has been slow in some services, there is momentum and progress is being made. </p><p>The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rsquo;, commits to continue with the successful decongregation programme and complete a further move of more people with disabilities from congregated settings to homes in the community, with the necessary supports.

This funding allocation is detailed in the table below.

This unprecedented additional amount of money signals our determination in government to fund an expansion of, and improvements in, our health and social care services. Included in the extra money is &euro;650m for testing and tracing and &euro;650m for provision of PPE.  And in the coming year, a robust and comprehensive testing and tracing system will be critical to the effective functioning of our health services and the broader economy.</p>  <p>  These additional resources will provide capacity for over 100,000 tests per week, supply PPE where needed and continue into 2021 all of the necessary Covid-19 action plan measures that have been put in place since March.</p>  <p>  Testing and contact tracing continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, and to ensure we have a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation, central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19, a provision of &euro;650m has been made in Budget 2021. This relates to all associated costs &ndash; swabbing, laboratory tests, contact tracing and relevant logistics. Some of this funding is held centrally by Government in the contingency fund.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a worldwide shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the health service responded quickly and developed guaranteed supply lines to ensure adequate PPE was available in 2020, along with ensuring the stock levels were increased.</p>  <p>  Recognising the unprecedented uncertainty faced by policy-makers in planning for the progression of COVID-19, a PPE Estimation Model was developed to provide for a transparent, dynamic, evidence-based estimate of required PPE for the Irish healthcare system. &euro;650m has been provided in 2021 to meet the costs associated with maintaining appropriate levels of PPE stock to ensure all healthcare professionals have the protection they need. In addition, investment in indigenous manufacturing and supply will have wider economic benefits for the country. </p></reply>

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, the HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. Individuals may also qualify for a medical card through the means assessment process. Where such individuals might be in excess of the income guidelines every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  In such circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  The HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The work of the CAG group has concluded and a Report was submitted recently to my Department which I intend to publish shortly.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my officials are reviewing the CAG Report and will be giving detailed policy consideration to the issues identified in the Report, in order to determine how the needs of these patients can be best addressed.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis.

In June 2019, a system of gain-share was introduced and is administered by the PCERS with the objective of encouraging the prescribing of the BVB medicines. This has been largely successful in increasing uptake of these medicines. By year-end, the initiative is on track to deliver approximately &euro;42m in savings, with 2021 full year savings projected to be in the region of &euro;50 &ndash; 80 million. </p>  <p>  While progress has been positive, the Department of Health and HSE are continuously monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of current levers to ensure that the State can capitalise on the most efficient policy approach.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at  </p><p>Under Levels 3 and 4 of the plan, the public health advice on domestic travel is to stay in your county (or other defined geographical area) apart from essential work, education and other essential purposes.</p><p>Further information on domestic travel under each level of the Plan is available at: </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:</p>  <p>  - vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government Our Shared Future, sets out the Government's priorities under the strategy. </p>  <p>  Since the strategy was published in 2017, the funding provided by the Department of Health to implement the strategy increased from &euro;122m in 2016 to &euro;129m in 2019. A further &euro;6m was provided for addiction and related services to meet the needs of people who are homeless in this period. </p>  <p>  Expenditure on HSE addiction services increased from &euro;94 million in 2016 to over &euro;100 million in 2019. This funding is used by the HSE to deliver a wide range of national policy objectives as outlined in the National Drugs Strategy including a focus on early intervention; treatment; and rehabilitation. This in turn helps people with substance misuse issue to achieve better health outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health increased funding to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces from &euro;28 million in 2016 to &euro;29 million in 2019. This funding supports over 280 community projects in local areas and communities throughout the country to support initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol use and misuse. The additional of &euro;1 million funds 13 strategic health initiatives identified by Task Forces to respond to emerging trends in substance misuse and to improve access to services for people with complex needs. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;3 million was provided for the implementation of the strategy in 2020.  This funding supports the implementation of the Health Diversion Programme, to expand addiction services for pregnant and post-natal women, and to develop a community alcohol service in Galway and a residential treatment service for women and children in the mid-west region.</p>  <p>  I announced new funding of &euro;4.1 million for the following new drug and alcohol services in Budget 2021:</p>  <p>  - &euro;1 million to develop targeted drug and alcohol initiatives through the network of drug and alcohol task forces, and to increase core funding for existing services</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 million to increase residential treatment services for people with severe drug and alcohol dependency across the country, including a step-up stabilisation facility in CHOs Cork/Kerry, Mid-West and South East and a low threshold programme in Dublin North East Inner City</p>  <p>  - &euro;700,000 to expand community and family support services, including initiatives in Donegal/Leitrim/Sligo, Louth/Meath, Cork/Kerry, and Dublin North Inner City</p>  <p>  - &euro;400,000 for harm reduction initiatives, including pilot drug monitoring at festivals and the night-time economy, expanded access to the drugs and alcohol helpline and increased provision of naloxone.</p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;11m will be provided in 2021 to meet the complex health needs of people who are homeless, including those in addiction, arising from Covid-19.

This process is needed to ensure patient safety. </p>  <p>  Doctors who wish to pursue specialist training in Ireland, including in relation to General Practice, must hold registration on the Trainee Specialist Division of the Medical Council&rsquo;s register.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides that medical practitioners who hold qualifications from non-EEA countries are eligible to be registered in the Trainee Specialist Division if they have passed the Council&rsquo;s Pre-Registration Examination System (PRES) or are exempt from the PRES in line with legislation, have an approved training post and have been granted in a third country a document which, in the opinion of the Council, is at least the equivalent of a certificate of experience (internship).</p>  <p>  The Medical Council recognises internships in a number of countries as equivalent to Irish internships.  These include Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sudan and Malaysia.  However, internships from non-EEA countries outside of these countries are not currently recognised by the Council. </p>  <p>  The Medical Practitioners Act is being amended by the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020.  The 2020 Act will remove the requirement to hold the equivalence of the certificate of experience for entry to the Trainee Specialist Division.  This Act was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President earlier this month.  Once the relevant provision has been commenced, doctors wishing to pursue specialist training will be eligible to apply for registration on the Trainee Specialist Division without being required to hold the equivalence of the certificate of experience.  It is important to state that registration on this division continues to require the applicant to hold a training post approved by the Medical Council for specialist training, as well as meeting all the other requirements for registration.   </p></reply>

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. </p>  <p>  In addition, budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year as well as adding significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce. </p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The HSE began planning for the resumption of adult disability day services in May. A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders, including Inclusion Ireland, was convened and tasked with the development of a Resumption Plan. On May 31st the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published and the guidance to support this framework was published on July 8th. </p>  <p>  The guidance is to enable safe and person-centred disability day service supports to be provided in line with current public health advice and infection control guidance. It is not overly prescriptive in terms of detail as there is a wide diversity of disability in the 19,000 adults that received day service supports and day service locations vary enormously in size and capacity. Of this 19,000, approximately 5,000 people receive a day service as part of their residential placement. </p>  <p>  The key overarching elements of managing the risk of infection are </p>  <p>1.  Processes to identify people (service users and staff) with communicable infection (including COVID-19) before they access services/attend work or as soon as possible after they access services/attend work</p>  <p>2.  Processes to minimize the risk of spread of infection from people (service users and staff) who access services/attend for work with unrecognized infection (Standard Precautions)</p>  <p>3.  Early detection of spread of infection in the service and immediate response to limit harm</p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services also has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened through August and September, they re-opened at 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. The HSE also plan to capture the detail of the service being provided to each individual over the next few weeks, to get a better understanding of the quantum of service being provided.</p>  <p>  The investment of &euro;100 million in the Budget for people with a disability will build the capacity of our adult disability services and increase day services by one day a week, for those whose services were reduced due to COVID-19.  It will also support around 1,700 young people who leave school and training programmes in 2021. </p>  <p>  In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly, Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions also refers to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p>  <p>  Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.</p>  <p>  Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific information requested by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.</p></reply>

It includes 86 recommendations in total, over 15 thematic areas, with associated timelines for implementation over the short, medium and long term.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health established an oversight structure to progress the important recommendations contained in this Report. This encompassed the establishment of both an Implementation Oversight Team and a Reference Group. There is a key focus on the implementation of recommendations that require immediate action to ensure ongoing preparedness as we move into the winter months.</p>  <p>  HIQA recently submitted a business case to the Department, outlining the current impact on regulatory activity, the current designation of resources, and the expected increase in resources necessary to continue to deliver on its statutory role as regulator to year end and into next year.</p>  <p>  Based on the impacts on regulatory activity by HIQA, the Department has approved funding providing for 7 additional inspectors, and additional support staff to assist the inspectorate. HIQA has commenced the recruitment process. This action contributes towards the implementation of recommendation 14.3 of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report. Additionally, following further analysis of the Expert Panel&rsquo;s report, HIQA has submitted a further business case to support the implementation of the Panel&rsquo;s recommendations. The Department is examining this in detail, having regard to the outcome of Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  HIQA takes a risk-based approach to regulation which means that it makes decisions based on the information that it has. As such, it prioritises regulatory activity and organises its approach to monitoring, inspection and enforcement, based on the assessment of the risk that the regulated services pose. In this context the regulator tailors its regulatory responses, including the frequency of inspections, so that they are proportionate to the relevant risks.</p></reply>

This model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent, flexible service, with a permanent dedicated workforce. </p>  <p>  The HSE has adopted RNA PCR as the gold standard test for diagnosing Covid-19 cases, as part of the HSE test and trace strategy, consistent with international best practice, and approved by NPHET.  This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed. The vast majority of Covd-19 tests carried out to date are PCR tests.</p>  <p>  Regarding rapid PCR testing equipment, the HSE advises it has access to about 3,000 rapid PCR tests per week, all of this is used in acute settings for high priority, accidents, critical care. It is not used for any priority groups, but rather hospital priority cases which require urgent turnaround, and is designed for small batches of 1-16 tests. The HSE is constantly trying to increase supply of rapid PCR tests.</p>  <p>  Many of the rapid non-PCR Covid tests reported in the media which purport to offer a test result in minutes may lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare.  However, this issue continues to be monitored by WHO, ECDC, HIQA, and the HSE Laboratory taskforce.</p>  <p>  NPHET will continue to consider and review, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. For example, very few other countries have carried out such mass testing in Long Term Residential Care facilities.  The HSE has also carried out serial testing in meat and food processing facilities, Direct Provision Centres, and schools.</p>  <p>  In terms of different types of testing, NPHET is also considering the findings of a rapid Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of alternatives to laboratory-based PCR testing to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2. This HTA will be used to inform the national testing strategy, specifically in relation to the potential use of rapid tests in Ireland. </p>  <p>  A number of key considerations will need to be taken into account in relation to the deployment of any rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 including test accuracy and performance in the specific test setting, disease prevalence, training, resourcing, operational factors, governance structures, quality assurance, clinical oversight, as well as integration with the contact tracing system and overall national testing strategy. </p></reply>

It covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. </p>  <p>  An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017.  On establishment the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group identified key early areas for action and established two sub-groups, one on Healthy Eating and one on Reformulation.  </p>  <p>  Due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the business of the Department of Health and upon the work of many of its members, the OPIOG has only met once in 2020 to date.  This meeting was held remotely on 24th September and the meeting was updated on the progress of the work of the two sub-groups.</p>  <p>  The sub-group on Healthy Eating has as a priority output the development of Healthy Eating Guidelines for 1-4 year-olds.  The Guidelines and associated resources, including a new Children&rsquo;s Food Pyramid, were approved by the OPIOG at its meeting and were launched by Minister Donnelly, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and myself on 1st. October 2020.  This work is now being followed by the development of nutrition standards for Early Learning and Care settings.</p>  <p>  The sub-group on Reformulation has as its priority the setting of targets for food and drink reformulation and a &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; for reformulation action to achieve those targets.

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  The Plan recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  The OPAP is based on the best available evidence in the Irish and international literature, and is informed by established international models and frameworks.  </p>  <p>  Completion of the progress report of each recommendation of the OPAP was delayed due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Departmental business.  However, it is now in the final stages of design and proofing and is expected to be completed and published within the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  The evaluation of the OPAP being carried out by the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research is at an advanced stage, and it is expected that this will be published in late 2020 or early 2021.</p></reply>

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  </p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. </p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. </p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will co-ordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Joint Committee's recommendation regarding the establishment of an independent inquiry into the use of valproate medicines in Ireland, there are no plans to hold such an inquiry at present.</p></reply>

The industry has invested heavily in the last decade which has allowed it to grow its exports by over &euro;500 million in the period 2010-2019.</p>  <p>   In line with Programme for Government commitments, the recently published Climate Action (Amendment) Bill sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition to transition to a climate neutral economy out to 2050. All sections of the economy will need to contribute to this national objective, including agriculture, and indeed the pig sector. Nevertheless, It should be noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the pig herd account for a very small percentage of overall agriculture emissions. </p>  <p>   In terms of investments, the Department is currently focused on supporting animal health and welfare through industry programmes and capital investment. In TAMS we have the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme which is part of a suite of 7 schemes under TAMS II.  Approximately 50 investment items are grant aided under this measure and to date 313 pig farmers have been approved to purchase investment items under this scheme. In relation to payments, 137 applicants have already been paid &euro;1.4 million under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme. The principal objective of the Scheme is to assist farmers purchase new equipment for the upgrading of pig and poultry units on their farms thereby supporting farmers&rsquo; compliance with animal welfare legislative requirements under Council Directive 2008/120/EC of 18 Dec 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs. </p>  <p>  In addition, supports are available for Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) technology, which will reduce ammonia emissions from the land spreading of organic manures. Over &euro;32 million has been grant aided under the Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme to date. Pig units tend to have high energy demands and supports for renewable energy technologies are also available under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme. In time, such technologies will help lower CO2 emissions. </p>  <p>  A request for a revision to the ceiling for the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme of TAMS II has been received.  The request is for an amendment to increase the upper investment limit under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme. The request to increase this investment limit will be considered in light of the available budget. </p></reply>

The set of measures in these regulations provides a basic level of protection against possible adverse impacts to waters arising from the agricultural sources.</p>  <p>  A review of Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates derogation was undertaken in 2019. The review examined further opportunities for derogation farmers to improve efficiencies and continue to reduce their environmental footprint with particular regard to water, climate, biodiversity and air quality.  It is accepted that compliance of a higher standard is required from more intensive derogation farmers to ensure a greater level of environment efficiency is achieved. One of the conclusions of the review highlighted inter alia, that &ldquo;In addition, the Commission has requested Ireland to review some of the technical aspects of the Nitrates Action Programme and ........the annual excretion rates for livestock as per Table 6 of SI 605 2017 be reviewed based on most recent scientific research&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The current excretion rates for livestock are specified in Table 6 of Schedule 2 (Annex 1) of Statutory Instrument 605 of 2017. The excretion rates for livestock were last evaluated in 2003. In 2019, Teagasc reviewed the excretion rate for the Dairy Cow following the recommendations of the Review group.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the review was that the most accurate excretion figure for the average Irish dairy cow is 89kgs of nitrogen.  This reflects the higher average milk yields that farmers are achieving now compared to when the figure was first calculated over 25 years ago. It is important that Ireland demonstrates its ongoing commitment to managing the environmental impact of agriculture on the environment including applying the latest science.</p>  <p>  All farmers are required to comply with stocking rate limits, 170kgs N/ha or in the case of derogation farmers 250 kgs N/ha. Farmers can comply with limits by reducing stock numbers, exporting slurry or renting extra land. </p></reply>

Teagasc are currently researching  MSS and further research is being undertaken again by UCD and  in conjunction with the work of the Devenish Nutrition and the Global Innovation Centre. This research aims to demonstrates the benefits of a move away from a monoculture of perennial rye grass to introducing a mix species sward which includes several grass types (for example timothy and cocksfoot and along with legumes and herbs) in order to reduce Nitrogen inputs and deliver other environmental benefits.
