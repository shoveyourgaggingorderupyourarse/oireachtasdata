The role of my Department is to maintain the Central Depository of contracts and supporting documentation submitted under the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I have spoken recently with James Browne TD, Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Damien English TD Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail and heard their concerns about the current scheme.  Those Ministers have requested a review of the scheme.  I have agreed that my Department will participate in any review deemed necessary in order to provide further support for non-EEA workers in the fishing industry.  An initial meeting of officials took place yesterday, Wednesday, to commence this process.</p></reply>

A tree felling licence is not required as part of an application for the Scheme, however, the application will undergo Appropriate Assessment Screening.</p>  <p>  To date, the Department has received 410 applications for 1,608 hectares  and has decided on 128 of those for 434 hectares. Of the outstanding applications, while all have not yet been assessed we have identified that  approximately 100 are currently delayed due to the requirement for planning permission for the replacement of Broadleaf High Forest, in this case Ash, with conifer species. </p>  <p>  I know this poses difficulties for landowners wishing to replace their diseased ash plantation and my officials have been in contact  with their counterparts in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue. </p>  <p>   We are exploring potential alternatives to the current system that requires both planning permission and a felling licence or exemption from a felling licence. Along with Minister of Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, we are committed to resolving this situation and my Department will update in due course on developments.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

These deployments include two Counsellors - in Brussels and London - as well as 14 attach&eacute;s in diverse global locations, including our traditional trading partners across Europe and in the United States, and in evolving markets in locations such as China, Korea, Japan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.  These have become particularly important in recent years, since the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews overseas assignments, to ensure that our presence abroad supports market access in key target locations and delivers on the expected benefits.</p>  <p>  The role of agricultural attach&eacute;s within the embassy network varies according to the assigned post, but is primarily focused on trade assistance and facilitation as part of the Department&rsquo;s market development remit.</p>  <p>  Securing and enhancing market access to countries outside the EU is usually a lengthy process involving much interaction between officials in the Department and their counterparts in competent authorities in importing countries.</p>  <p>  The detailed technical work in negotiating market access involves completion of lengthy questionnaires on official controls, hosting inspection visits, conducting overseas trade missions and reaching agreement on export health certificates or protocols which dictate the conditions under which agri-food products are traded. </p>  <p>  Liaison with Irish embassies abroad is critical to all those exchanges, and by initiating and developing relationships with competent authorities and other agencies in those countries, agricultural attach&eacute;s support my Department&rsquo;s access efforts in targeted markets. The target markets are decided in consultation with industry stakeholders to ensure that my Department&rsquo;s work programme is aligned with exporters&rsquo; priorities.  </p>  <p>  Experience in recent years has shown that such contacts are crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to gain new market access and also to broaden and deepen existing levels of trade in both value and volume terms. </p>  <p>  The recent signing of protocols with China to allow for the export of sheepmeat and breeding pigs and the opening of the Japanese market for the export of minced beef and beef burgers earlier this year are just two examples of the successes of these interactions.</p></reply>

The establishment of such an Office requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Directive 2019/633, dealing with Unfair Trading Practices in the agricultural and food supply chain and which involves the establishment of an Enforcement Authority, was required to be transposed into national law by 1st May 2021. </p>  <p>  It was not possible to enact the primary legislation before the May transposition deadline so, as an interim measure, I am happy to advise the Deputy that, in April this year, ahead of that deadline, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 to transpose the Directive directly into Irish law. </p>  <p>  I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new Office. However, I want to assure the Deputy that the Enforcement Authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the Unfair Trading Practices defined in the Directive. </p>  <p>  The Enforcement Authority will shortly be undertaking an awareness-raising campaign on the UTP Regulations and will be engaging with relevant stakeholders in the agricultural and food products supply chain.</p>  <p>  In regard to the plans for establishing the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation is currently being prepared. As part of those preparations, consideration is being given to the submissions made in response to the public consultation held by my Department earlier this year, and also whether the provisions of the UTP Directive need to be extended. </p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  Increasing transparency all along the food chain is something that I believe is very important to help strengthen the position of farmers, fishers and food businesses. The legislation will provide that the new Office of the Food Ombudsman or equivalent will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland in line with the Programme for Government commitment. </p>  <p>  I intend that the new Office will build on the work already done on market transparency, including the market transparency studies commissioned by my Department as part of the work of the Beef Taskforce, which have been completed and published on gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I also  assure you, Deputy, that I am fully committed to ensuring that the Programme for Government commitment is implemented as quickly as possible and I am pleased to say that, as announced in the details of Budget 2022, &euro;4 million has been provided in the estimates for the establishment of the new Office.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the new Regulations I introduced in April are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural and food suppliers, providing them with a service that they can avail of with regard to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing work in this area in order to bring much-needed transparency to the sector.</p></reply>

For 2020, the figure was 15%, the highest since 2010.

Member States are required to strengthen their capacity in gender mainstreaming and in the collection of sex disaggregated data.</p>  <p>  The SWOT analysis in preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) identified gender inequality as a weakness, while the economic benefits of increasing female participation was identified as an opportunity. </p>  <p>  The Needs Assessment for the CSP points to the need to increase opportunities for women in agriculture and business development. I have engaged extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP, including on supports to promote gender equality, and the development of the new CSP continues in advance of the end-of-year deadline.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels, and proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture.</p>  <p>  More can be done in this space and I am committed to delivering greater numbers of female farmers in Ireland.</p></reply>

The establishment of such an Office requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Directive 2019/633, dealing with Unfair Trading Practices in the agricultural and food supply chain and which involves the establishment of an Enforcement Authority, was required to be transposed into national law by 1st May 2021. </p>  <p>  It was not possible to enact the primary legislation before the May transposition deadline so, as an interim measure, I am happy to advise the Deputy that, in April this year, ahead of that deadline, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 to transpose the Directive directly into Irish law. </p>  <p>  I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new Office. However I want to assure the Deputy that the Enforcement Authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the Unfair Trading Practices defined in the Directive. </p>  <p>  The Enforcement Authority will shortly be undertaking an awareness-raising campaign on the UTP Regulations and will be engaging with relevant stakeholders in the agricultural and food products supply chain.</p>  <p>  In regard to the plans for establishing the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation is currently being prepared. As part of those preparations, consideration is being given to the submissions made in response to the public consultation held by my Department earlier this year, and also whether the provisions of the UTP Directive need to be extended.</p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices</p>  <p>  Increasing transparency all along the food chain is something that I believe is very important to help strengthen the position of farmers, fishers and food businesses. The legislation will provide that the new Office of the Food Ombudsman or equivalent will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland in line with the Programme for Government commitment. I intend that the new Office will build on the work already done on market transparency, including the market transparency studies commissioned by my Department as part of the work of the Beef Taskforce, which have been completed and published on gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I also assure you, Deputy, that I am fully committed to ensuring that the Programme for Government commitment is implemented as quickly as possible and I am pleased to say that, as announced in the details of Budget 2022, &euro;4 million has been provided in the estimates for the establishment of the new Office.  I believe that the new Regulations I introduced in April are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural and food suppliers, providing them with a service that they can avail of with regard to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing this office in order to bring much-needed transparency to the sector.</p></reply>

To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. </p><p>Alongside Project Woodland, we continue to look at our processes. Changes were made to the way in which ecological reports were prepared, freeing up ecologists to spend more time to deal with the ecological assessment of the application.</p><p>My officials also examined all tree felling licences referred to ecology.  This resulted in approximately 50% of applications being returned to applicants or their Registered Forester, seeking further information, often a well-developed harvest plan.  We have begun to receive responses to these requests and would urge all applicants and registered foresters to reply to our communication so that these cases may progress. </p><p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25<sup>th </sup>June by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues. However we have now returned to and indeed exceeded expected levels with 585 licences issued in September, 511 of which were felling licences.Up to 15<sup>th</sup>October, my Department has issued 2,057 tree felling licences to  cover a volume of just over six million cubic metres.  Furthermore, Coillte's felling programme is fully licensed and they are working with the Department to ensure availability for this supply to market. We expect that their 2022 programme will be fully complete by year-end. </p><p>I am aware that the nursery sector is dependant on afforestation and that anticipated levels have not been achieved this year, with 1,755 hectares planted. At present, there are approved licences issued, for sites ready and available to plant covering 5,700 hectares.</p><p>I would encourage anyone with a valid afforestation licence to contact their forester and arrange planting.  Once planted, they may apply for the first of 15 annual premiums.  Afforestation licences for almost 3,400 hectares have issued this year and we now have a dedicated team of 10 ecologists working on afforestation files ahead of the planting season.  </p><p>It is important that the Department receives good quality applications from applicants and that they respond to any requests for further information and  a recent exercise on 550 afforestation files referred to ecology found that just over 10% of these files have supporting ecology habitat information.  It was highlighted to forestry companies earlier in the summer they should examine their afforestation applications that are referred to the Ecology Unit, and to provide additional ecology information and engage an ecologist as required.</p><p>We are examining opportunities to further incentivise afforestation measures in the context of the next forestry programme and the next CAP and my Department will be engaging with all relevant stakeholders over the next 12 months.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Government will be able to achieve its stated climate objectives, while at the same time maintaining agricultural output at current levels. The future CAP will actually support this objective rather than hinder it in any way. </p>  <p>  The issue of carbon sequestration is an important matter. Importantly, our land is a net emitter rather than a sink.  There is a lack of data currently to accurately assess the biomass content of hedgerows and thus sequestration potential. To address the lack of data and research, I have invested in many initiatives including a research project led by Teagasc called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo;. This project will advance the understanding of the contribution of hedgerows and non-forest woodland to carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes, and to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution over time, ensuring that their contribution is accurately represented in the inventory.</p></reply>

The establishment of such an Office requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Directive 2019/633, dealing with Unfair Trading Practices in the agricultural and food supply chain and which involves the establishment of an Enforcement Authority, was required to be transposed into national law by 1st May 2021. It was not possible to enact the primary legislation before the May transposition deadline so, as an interim measure, I am happy to advise the Deputy that, in April this year, ahead of that deadline, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 to transpose the Directive directly into Irish law. </p>  <p>  I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new Office. However, I want to assure the Deputy that the Enforcement Authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the Unfair Trading Practices defined in the Directive. The Enforcement Authority will shortly be undertaking an awareness-raising campaign on the UTP Regulations and will be engaging with relevant stakeholders in the agricultural and food products supply chain.</p>  <p>  In regard to the plans for establishing the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation is currently being prepared. As part of those preparations, consideration is being given to the submissions made in response to the public consultation held by my Department earlier this year, and also whether the provisions of the UTP Directive need to be extended. </p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  Increasing transparency all along the food chain is something that I believe is very important to help strengthen the position of farmers, fishers and food businesses. The legislation will provide that the new Office of the Food Ombudsman or equivalent will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland in line with the Programme for Government commitment. I intend that the new Office will build on the work already done on market transparency, including the market transparency studies commissioned by my Department as part of the work of the Beef Taskforce, which have been completed and published on gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I also you, Deputy, that I am fully committed to ensuring that the Programme for Government commitment is implemented as quickly as possible and I am pleased to say that, as announced in the details of Budget 2022, &euro;4 million has been provided in the estimates for the establishment of the new Office.  I believe that the new Regulations I introduced in April are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural and food suppliers, providing them with a service that they can avail of with regard to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing this office as a way of bringing much-needed transparency to the sector.</p></reply>

There is also an obvious need to avoid deforestation  in relation to economic and social considerations as well as  environmental considerations in terms of carbon, landscape and amenity.  </p><p>Therefore, to fell a tree or trees without a valid tree felling licence, unless exempted, is an offence under the Forestry Act. Having said that  there are clear exemptions  under Section 19 of the Act  where a tree felling licence is not required.  </p><p>The common scenarios where trees can be felled without the need to submit a felling licence application include:</p><p>- A tree in an urban area.</p><p>- A tree within 30 metres of a building (other than  a wall or temporary structure), but excluding any building built after the trees were planted.</p><p>- A tree less than five years of age that came about through natural regeneration and removed from a field as part of the normal maintenance of agricultural land (but not where the tree is standing in a hedgerow).</p><p>- A tree uprooted in a nursery for the purpose of transplantation.</p><p>- A tree of the willow or poplar species planted and maintained solely for fuel under a short rotation coppice.</p><p>- A tree outside a forest within 10 metres of a public road and which, in the opinion of the owner (being an opinion formed on reasonable grounds), is dangerous to person using the public road on account of its age or condition.</p><p>- A tree outside a forest, the removal of which is specified in a grant of planning permission.</p><p>- A tree outside a forest of the hawthorn or blackthorn species.</p><p>- A tree outside a forest in a hedgerow and felled for  the purposes of its trimming provided that the tree does not exceed 20 cm  in diameter when measured 1.3 metres from the ground.</p><p>- A tree outside a forest on an agricultural holding and  removed by the owner for use on that holding, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Forestry Act 2014</p><p>In line with these exemptions under Section  19 of the Forestry Act, tree felling carried out under the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme for Ash Dieback does not require a tree felling licence. </p><p>I also recently launched a Guide for Landowners to Managing Roadside Trees.  This informative Guide provides basic information on the benefits of such trees along with guidance on how to assess risk associated with roadside trees.</p></reply>

Our farmers continue to embrace this new technology with its use steadily increasing on Irish farms.</p><p>The AgClimatise Roadmap developed by the Department includes an ambitious target of achieving 60% of all slurry spread by LESS equipment by 2022, 80% by 2025 and 90% by 2027, I am confident we can achieve these targets.</p><p>The use of this technology is particularly effective in reducing ammonia emissions from our food systems, with agriculture in Ireland being responsible for 99% of national emissions. In October 2020 Teagasc published an Ammonia Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC). </p><p>This scientific based approach set out a series of actions that will bring the sector into compliance with our national targets for ammonia over the decade ahead. The Teagasc MACC sets out 13 measures for potential adoption on Irish farms, with the use of LESS to apply animal slurry identified as making the single largest contribution, with a potential to reduce emissions by up to 60% compared to current application systems.  </p><p>The Department continues to incentivise the uptake of this technology with the provision of grants through the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) and a LESS measure within the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS). Through TAMS, the Department has funded the purchase of over 3,000 LESS machines, while approximately 4,500 farmers have received payments under GLAS by selecting the LESS measure. </p><p>Under TAMS, LESS equipment provides financial aid to farmers to help them buy new slurry-spreading equipment which improves their environmental performance. While farmers in receipt of a Nitrates Derogation are no longer eligible for funding under the scheme, the majority of farmers which are not in receipt of a Nitrates Derogation continue to be eligible to apply.</p><p>As part of the Nitrates Derogation rules for 2021, all slurry on these holding must be applied using LESS equipment, this represents a significant step up from previous years. This will significantly increase the quantities of slurry being spread by such technologies nationally and will contribute significantly to achieving our targets.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Draft Nitrates Action Programme, which went out for public consultation earlier this year, has been designed to facilitate the further adoption of LESS technology, with the requirement for more of our animal slurries to be applied using LESS. As drafted the Nitrates Programme proposes that more of our livestock famers will be required to use this new technology, while our tillage farmers applying organic manures to arable land will need to use LESS or incorporate manures within 12 hours of application. </p><p>I am confident that the measures the Department is implementing will facilitate the continued increase in use of LESS technology on Irish farms and that the sector will achieve the targets set out in the AgClimatise Roadmap.  </p></reply>

The key topics are fairness, economic viability, and the likely impact of the Plan on part-time and full-time farmers and their communities.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Pillar 1 redistributive measures, I am proposing that payments should be capped at &euro;66,000, with no provision made for salaries.  On internal convergence, each entitlement value is required to reach a minimum of 85% of the national average value by 2026.  My proposal is that this will be done in an incremental way over the period to allow farmers time to adjust. </p>  <p>  Regarding redistribution, the Complementary Redistributive Income Support for Sustainability (CRISS) provides that 10% of direct payments funding is redistributed to small- and medium-sized farmers via so-called "front-loading". I am proposing that this 10% will be redistributed on the first 30 hectares of every farm, at an estimated rate  of &euro;43.14 per eligible hectare. </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas has received regular updates on the CAP negotiations at official and Ministerial level and this will continue as the plan is developed further.  </p>  <p>  The Department will be conducting a statutory and public consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP later this year.  I will then seek Government approval in December before submission of the plan to the EU Commission by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The establishment of such an Office requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Directive 2019/633, dealing with Unfair Trading Practices in the agricultural and food supply chain and which involves the establishment of an Enforcement Authority, was required to be transposed into national law by 1st May 2021. </p>  <p>  It was not possible to enact the primary legislation before the May transposition deadline so, as an interim measure, I am happy to advise the Deputy that, in April this year, ahead of that deadline, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 to transpose the Directive directly into Irish law. </p>  <p>  I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new Office. However, I want to assure the Deputy that the Enforcement Authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the Unfair Trading Practices defined in the Directive. </p>  <p>  The Enforcement Authority will shortly be undertaking an awareness-raising campaign on the UTP Regulations and will be engaging with relevant stakeholders in the agricultural and food products supply chain.</p>  <p>  In regard to the plans for establishing the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation is currently being prepared. </p>  <p>  As part of those preparations, consideration is being given to the submissions made in response to the public consultation held by the Department earlier this year, and also whether the provisions of the UTP Directive need to be extended. </p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  Increasing transparency all along the food chain is something that I believe is very important to help strengthen the position of farmers, fishers and food businesses. The legislation will provide that the new Office of the Food Ombudsman or equivalent will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland in line with the Programme for Government commitment. I intend that the new Office will build on the work already done on market transparency, including the market transparency studies commissioned by my Department as part of the work of the Beef Taskforce, which have been completed and published on gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I also assure you, Deputy, that I am fully committed to ensuring that the Programme for Government commitment is implemented as quickly as possible and I am pleased to say that, as announced in the details of Budget 2022, &euro;4 million has been provided in the estimates for the establishment of the new Office.  I believe that the new Regulations I introduced in April are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural and food suppliers, providing them with a service that they can avail of with regard to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing work in this area in order to bring much-needed transparency to the sector.</p></reply>

Funding for the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) has been increased to &euro;21 million up from &euro;16million last year with a further &euro;2 million for further organic sector development measures.  This increase is very welcome and addresses the growing demand from both farmers and consumers for this type of production. This effectively doubles the funding for organics since I took office less than two years ago. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware the current Programme for Government contains a commitment to align Ireland&rsquo;s organic land area with that of the current EU average of approximately 7.5% over the lifetime of this Government. Budget 2022, with its increased allocation for organic farming, will assist in working towards that. At the same time I will also be continuing to progress the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with market opportunities.</p>  <p>  The additional funding to be allocated to the opening of the Organic Farming Scheme in 2022 could provide for an additional fifty thousand hectares converting to organic production in 2022. This would represent an increase in excess of 50% increase in the area currently farmed organically and takes us further along the route to the goal of 7.5% land cover. I am encouraging all farmers from all sectors to join and my Department and relevant Agencies and advisory bodies will be working with them before the opening of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Organic Farming Scheme,  Budget 2022 will provide funding for other supports for organic farmers, such as the Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme. Initiatives to assist in the development of the sector such as the Organic Demonstration Farm Programme and other training and education projects will also be funded. Organic farming and production is a key priority of mine. No Minister or Government has ever funded its expansion to this extent and I intend to continue to invest in its future under the next CAP also.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- A pilot project for pre-application discussions.</p><p>- Payment of an Environmental Planning Grant.</p><p>- A new Customer Charter for forestry.</p><p>- A Communication Plan that assists my Department in conveying the multi-functional benefits of forestry.</p><p>- A review of the organisational structure of forestry within my Department.</p><p>- Commission of a Training Needs analysis.</p><p>- Definition of the backlog and associated dashboards.</p><p>- Actions relating to reduction of the backlog.</p><p>Alongside Project Woodland, we continue to look at streamlining our processes. Changes were made to the way in which ecological reports were prepared, freeing up ecologists to spend more time to deal with the ecological assessment of the application.</p><p>My officials also examined all  licences referred to ecology.  This resulted in approximately 50% of felling  applications being returned to applicants or their Registered Forester, seeking further information, often a well-developed harvest plan.</p><p>We have begun to receive responses to these requests and would urge all applicants and registered foresters to reply to our communication so that these cases may progress. In terms of afforestation licences it was found that just over 10% of 550 files have supporting ecology habitat information.  It was highlighted to forestry companies earlier in the summer they should examine their afforestation applications that are referred to the Ecology Unit, and to provide additional ecology information and engage an Ecologist as required.</p><p>As regards road licences a cohort of these were also returned to registered foresters or applicants for further information. Good quality applications are an essential part of a functioning licensing system. </p><p>While there are challenges in delivering licences, I am pleased to note that licensing output in September at 585 licences was the highest in any one month since April 2019 and we hope to sustain an increased level of output to year end.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to recognise the momentum and progress made under Project Woodland and I acknowledge the commitment shown by all involved, particularly the representatives from the Forestry Policy Group who make up the membership of the Working Groups.</p><p>Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for the sector, I am committed to the success of this Project and by working together I believe we can deliver on its ambitions for the benefit of the forestry sector and society at large.</p></reply>

Funding for the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) has been increased to &euro;21 million up from &euro;16million last year with a further &euro;2 million for further organic sector development measures.  This increase is very welcome and addresses the growing demand from both farmers and consumers for this type of production. This effectively doubles the funding for organics since I took office less than two years ago. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware the current Programme for Government contains a commitment to align Ireland&rsquo;s organic land area with that of the current EU average of approximately 7.5% over the lifetime of this Government. Budget 2022, with its increased allocation for organic farming, will assist in working towards that. At the same time I will also be continuing to progress the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with market opportunities.</p>  <p>  The additional funding to be allocated to the opening of the Organic Farming Scheme in 2022 could provide for an additional fifty thousand hectares converting to organic production in 2022. This would represent in excess an increase of 50% increase in the area currently farmed organically and takes us further along the route to the goal of 7.5% land cover. I am encouraging all farmers from all sectors to join and my Department and relevant Agencies and advisory bodies will be working with them before the opening of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Organic Farming Scheme,  Budget 2022 will provide funding for other supports for organic farmers, such as the Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme. Initiatives to assist in the development of the sector such as the Organic Demonstration Farm Programme and other training and education projects will also be funded. Organic farming and production is a key priority of mine. No Minister or Government has ever funded its expansion to this extent and I intend to continue to invest in its future under the next CAP also.</p></reply>

It has  the twin objectives of  improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, and of creating a shared national vision for forestry in Ireland by means of a new forest strategy. </p>  <p>  In developing the forest strategy all matters pertaining to the future of forestry in Ireland,  including a close to nature model of forestry, will as I understand it, be considered. </p>  <p>  The structure of Project Woodland is such that four Working Groups, led by an independent Chair and with stakeholders drawn from the Forestry Policy Group, each deal with a specific aspect of the project.  Working Group 2 is developing the  national forest strategy, and  working collaboratively has made significant progress, securing the approval of the Project Board to a detailed public consultation plan.  </p>  <p>  This plan aims for an effective  and inclusive public consultation process which will now be undertaken as a matter of priority. </p>  <p>  There are various stands to this approach. Irish Rural Link has already begun work on  a Community Engagement Study on Forestry and Woodlands as commissioned by Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector. </p>  <p>  A tender issued in September for the Strategic Environmental Analysis/Appropriate Assessment process, including public consultation on the draft plans and Environmental Report. In addition quotes have recently been sought for external consultants to conduct an omnibus survey of public attitudes to trees, woods and woodlands, and a  tender will issue shortly for a survey on the vision for forestry to 2050 and for the next 100 years to 2121.</p>  <p>  It is also the intention to hold bi-lateral stakeholder meetings, to undertake a  deliberative dialogue  in the form of  a national event , to convene  a Youth Forum and to schedule a National Stakeholder event. </p>  <p>  The new Strategy, once formed, will be the enabler of the next National Forestry Programme, which is due to commence in 2023.</p>  <p>  I would like to invite everybody with an interest in forestry in Ireland to actively contribute to this consultation process.  </p>  <p>  It's worth saying that we do have a Close-to-Nature forestry management system as part of the current National Forestry Programme. Grant funding is available for forest owners who want to apply this system, known as Continuous Cover Forestry,  under the Woodland Improvement Scheme  The scheme provides funding for conversion of existing forests to Continuous Cover Forestry over a 12-year transitional period. Successful applicants are eligible for three payments  of &euro;750 for three separate interventions.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the outcome of the consultative process which will inform a new vision for forestry in Ireland and which will no doubt  encompass views on the close to nature model.</p></reply>

Forestry is not part of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. </p><p>However, there is potential for some trading of forestry-generated carbon on voluntary markets which does take place in other countries mainly for corporate social responsibility by businesses rather than for mandatory compliance. </p><p>Generally voluntary carbon markets are setup to incentivise activities that are <b>in addition</b>to what currently takes place and don&rsquo;t generally provide funding for existing forests that are already sequestering carbon. However this is for the market to decide.</p><p>Forest owners can directly benefit from voluntary carbon markets depending on particular circumstances. For example this can be where a landowner partners with a private company who wish to be associated with the environmental benefits of the farmer&rsquo;s forestry and will pay the farmer for this right.</p><p>My Department is at the early stages of exploring opportunities for the development of such a voluntary carbon market in Ireland. </p><p>This would look at encouraging reductions in emissions and at the same time develop a potential alternative source of income for landowners and foresters. </p><p>This could  be similar to our existing Woodland Environment Fund which includes a mix of private finance and state funding to pay farmers to establish native woodlands and this model has worked well or could be other voluntary models with similar outcomes. </p><p>Such carbon farming is highlighted as an option in the EU Green Deal and the European Commission is examining ways of encouraging activities that remove carbon across sectors, including involvement by the voluntary carbon trading sector. </p><p>We will work with stakeholders and will explore options for the development of such tools which encourage the removal of carbon in line with these developments. </p><p>At the moment we directly fund afforestation by providing a range of grants, premiums and tax incentives on the sale of timber but there may be opportunities for adjusting this model in future through complementary voluntary carbon markets for example. </p><p>I am committed to putting farmers and forest owners at the very centre of this space.</p></reply>

It is important that the increased removal and storage of atmospheric carbon brought about through the activities of our farmers is not only recognised in the National Inventory Reporting accounting system but also that farmers receive the recognition for their efforts in this area.</p>  <p>  In recent months I have invested in a number of initiatives which will provide the scientific evidence needed to accurately quantify the on-farm carbon removals happening on our farms. I believe that this data will not only refine the emission profile of our farms but it will also inform policy decisions in this area to better support farmers in their efforts to sequester, store and protect carbon through better management decisions.</p>  <p>  I would like to highlight the recent establishment of the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory (NASCO) with supporting technology for the measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a range of different soil and farm types. The outputs from this project will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research. This carbon flux infrastructure will be located on a number of Teagasc Signpost farms. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the Soil Carbon Observatory I have  also recently launched the Pilot Soil Sampling and Analysis Programme which will provide a baseline assessment of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) across the country. </p>  <p>  In addition, Teagasc has also recently commenced a research project called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo;. This project will provide a deeper understanding of hedgerows and non-forest woodland as carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes and will allow researchers to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution.</p>  <p>  The knowledge gained from these activities I believe will place Ireland at the forefront of research in carbon farming while also allowing for the refinement of our reporting to the National Inventory further emphasising the sustainability of the agricultural sector.</p></reply>

However, I and officials within my Department continually engage with Minister Ryan and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on all energy related matters from an agricultural perspective, as well as a wide range of industry and other stakeholder groupings. </p>  <p>  The potential for the agricultural and forestry sector to contribute to the renewable energy sector through the provision of biomass and agricultural feedstocks is well recognised. In recent months officials within my Department have engaged extensively with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on their recent National Heat Decarbonisation Study project which aims to assess, amongst other things, the ability of the agricultural sector to provide relevant feedstocks to the Anaerobic Digestion industry.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with farmers and other relevant stakeholders as part of its regulatory role in the Anaerobic Digestion industry specifically when animal-by-products are utilised as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion. There are currently twelve anaerobic digesters producing biogas in operation nationally that are approved and under license by my Department.</p>  <p>  Engagement with interested stakeholders, including farmers and farm organisations has been further strengthened through the current DECC-led public consultation on the Introduction of a Renewable Heat Obligation which will further enhance the demand and consequent feasibility of the developing Anaerobic Digestion industry in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The development of an anaerobic digestion industry in Ireland must be based on scientific research and country specific data. Towards this end my Department continues to support research, development and demonstration in this particular area. </p>  <p>  Two projects in particular which have received part-funding from my Department through the European Innovation Partnerships initiative (EIP), as part of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will provide this much needed information.  The Bio-refinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green bio-refineries) and Irish Bio-energy Association (IrBEA) (small biogas demonstration programme) have both been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each. I look forward to seeing the results of these projects which  will provide valuable information of specific relevance to Irish farmers.</p></reply>

The Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) includes agricultural actions that promote and preserve biodiversity both directly and indirectly. The three-tier hierarchy system prioritizes actions which target the preservation of priority habitats and species, through promotion of sustainable farming practices.</p><p>The deputy may also be aware that earlier this year my department launched the Results-based Environment-Agri Pilot project (REAP), which links payments to the quality of the environmental outcomes delivered on each participating farm.</p><p>In a similar vein, the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP&rsquo;s) funded by this Department as part of the Rural Development Programme, look to address biodiversity and other environmental challenges at a local level, in collaboration with the farming community and other interested stakeholders. This programme covers a diverse range of initiaves from the protection of the pearl mussel to the improvement of habitats and semi-natural habitats in upland areas.</p><p>As part of budget 2021, funding of &euro;5 million was dedicated to developing a pilot 'Farm Environmental Study' programme. This programme will begin the process of developing a national baseline database of farm scale habitat and biodiversity data along with additional environmental parameters. The Department is at an advanced stage in finalising the tender to implement this programme in 2021. The information gathered will enhance farmer knowledge of habitat and biodiversity on their farms, while also providing information to this Department which could be used to target future Agri-environment and Climate measures as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. </p><p>The knowledge gained from these programmes will be central to delivering benefits for Biodiversity, Water and Climate in this country.</p></reply>

The scheme also pays an annual premium to the landowner of up to &euro;680 per hectare payable each year for 15 years.</p>  <p>  Measures included in the programme are voluntary and comprise the main Afforestation Scheme (incorporating Native Woodland Establishment, Agro-Forestry and Forestry for Fibre), as well as a variety of support schemes to help forest owners with the management of their forests, including timber mobilisation. </p>  <p>  This approach has resulted in over 28,000 hectares of forestry having been planted on private lands during the Programme so far.</p>  <p>  The money will also help to progress the programme of reform and delivery of a new forest strategy which is happening under Project Woodland. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Project Woodland was launched in February this year and one of its key objectives is the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy for the future of forests in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This includes an extensive and inclusive public consultation, which has been approved by the Project Board and will be undertaken as a matter of priority. I would like to invite everybody with an interest in forestry in Ireland to actively contribute to this consultation process.  </p>  <p>  The measures that will be taken to make the sector more attractive to new entrants will be discussed as part of this consultation process and the development of the new Forest Strategy, which will be the enabler of the next National Forestry Programme, which is due to commence in 2023.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU aid and over &euro;27 million Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall as a result of disturbance to the market. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme, under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU, was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019. </p>  <p>  Reviewing the requirement at this stage is not an option. The money was paid to the participants who committed themselves to the explicit condition that they would make the 5% reduction.  </p>  <p>  Any change would be a  breach  of the EU regulation under which the &euro;50 million was granted to Ireland.  It would  also be grossly unfair to the almost 19,000 participants who have already met their commitments under the scheme  and to those farmers who were eligible but opted not to join the scheme. </p>  <p>  Approximately 21,000 beef finishers were eligible for a payment under the scheme but chose not to participate in the scheme, having reviewed the commitments required, which included the 5% reduction. Their average payment would have been over &euro;1,300 each. </p>  <p>  Following engagement with the EU Commission, I secured flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction. I introduced an option in March 2021 to  allow participants choose an alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 - 31st December 2021. This was to give  participants every chance of meeting their requirements under the scheme.. The option to select this facility remained open until 21st June 2021 with more than 16,000 applying. </p>  <p>  When the original reduction period ended on 30th June 2021, it was identified that approximately 5,300 of those approximately 16,000 BEAM participants who had opted to defer had in fact met all their BEAM commitments including the 5% bovine nitrates reduction. The Department therefore removed them from the later reduction period.</p>  <p>  This leaves approximately 10,700 BEAM participants in the later reduction period. These participants will continue to receive a monthly letter from my Department (as all participants have done since February 2021) outlining the amount of nitrates they have already used (accumulated), the amount of nitrates they have left if they are to  meet their 5% reduction and a projection based on the livestock numbers on their holding of their final nitrates position at the end of the reduction period. </p></reply>

The Taskforce was to meet at least quarterly from October 2019 for a period of one year after which the Taskforce&rsquo;s progress was to be reviewed.  However, progress was delayed in 2020 due to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I requested the independent Chair of the Beef Taskforce, to provide a report to me on the progress to date of the Taskforce, which he has done.  I will complete my analysis of the final report, after which I will make the necessary decision on future strategic engagement with the Sector.</p>  <p>  The beef sector agreement contained 38 specific actions. Of these 38 actions, 30 were finite actions which had timelines attached for completion. The remaining eight are ongoing actions, which by their nature, are long term and will continue outside of the context of the Beef Taskforce.  All documents from the Beef Taskforce meetings, including minutes and updated progress reports, are published on the Gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Taskforce was set up in response to the issues that prevailed in the sector in the late summer of 2019 and had very specific actions to address. It is conceivable that it may not be the most suitable vehicle for addressing those that exist in 2021 and beyond. I will make a decision on this shortly.</p>  <p>  Effective strategic engagement across the beef sector is crucial to its development in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable way, that works for all actors in the supply chain.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department and I will continue to support constructive strategic engagement within the sector, as well as measures aimed at strengthening the supply chain, including support for Producer Organisations, and interventions aimed at supporting productive and environmental efficiency for beef farmers in the future. I am also progressing  work to deliver the primary legislation required to established the office of the National Food Ombudsman. </p>  <p>   I believe this office will play a key role in bringing much-needed transparency to the sector.</p></reply>

It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.</p><p>A significant aspect of Project Woodland&rsquo;s work is to develop a new national vision for Irish forestry. Already the collaborative efforts of sector stakeholders, NGOs, environmental representatives and state actors is showing significant progress on this and a public consultation exercise has begun, with a study on Community Engagement on Forestry and Woodlands underway, a tender issued for the Strategic Environmental Analysis/Appropriate Assessment process and quotes sought for external consultants to conduct an omnibus survey of public attitudes to trees, woods and woodland. A tender will issue in the coming weeks for a public survey on the vision for forestry to 2050. Furthermore later this year and into 2022 bi-lateral stakeholder meetings will be held, deliberative dialogue  will be undertaken in the form of a national event, a Youth Forum will be convened and a National Stakeholder event will be scheduled.</p><p>In addition, an independent Systems Analyst is conducting an end-to-end process review with a view to licensing process improvement and an interim report on this work will be submitted to the Project Board in the near future.</p><p>There has been significant work carried out on all other aspects of Project Woodland too and updates on these be will contained  in the second interim report  of the Project Board which will issue shortly.

Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for he sector, I am in regular and intensive consultation with all stakeholders, and it is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy.</p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to the licencing system as a result of Court decisions which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. </p>  <p>  We are making progress under  Project Woodland and are about to select a preferred bidder with legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. In addition, a business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered. </p>  <p>  Alongside Project Woodland, we continue to look at our processes. Changes were made to the way in which ecological reports were prepared, freeing up ecologists to spend more time to deal with the ecological assessment of the application.   My officials also examined all tree felling licences referred to ecology.  This resulted in approximately 50% of applications being returned to applicants or their Registered Forester, seeking further information, often a well-developed harvest plan.  We have begun to receive responses to these requests and would urge all applicants and registered foresters to reply to our communication so that these cases may progress.</p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25th June by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues. However we have now returned and indeed exceeded expected levels with 585  licences issued in September, 511 of which were felling licences.   Up to 15th   October, my Department has issued 2,057 tree felling licences to  cover a volume of just over six million cubic metres.  Furthermore, Coillte's felling programme is fully licensed and they are working with the Department to ensure availability for this supply to market. We expect that their 2022 programme will be fully complete by year-end.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

To date, 4,274 applicants have been paid over &euro;48m. Over 9,000 approvals have issued to applicants with LESS investments representing a total commitment of over &euro;105m under the scheme. I would like to encourage any farmer with a payment claim outstanding for LESS or any of the other TAMS measures to submit them on the online system as soon as possible to allow for the early issue of payment.  </p>  <p>  All outstanding approvals issued represent potential outstanding liabilities for the Department and we must have a budget in place to pay these claims. As a result, it is not possible to consider increasing the grant aid for LESS equipment at this time.</p>  <p>  Final decisions have not yet been made in relation to the interventions to be included in the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP)(2023-2027). To allow for the submission of the draft CSP by 1st January 2022, the Department facilitated a public consultation on the draft CSP and written submissions were invited from interested parties by the closing date of 3rd September 2021. These submissions are currently being evaluated and ongoing stakeholder and further public consultation are continuing to take place.</p></reply>

Since the mid 1980s over 300,000 hectares of new forests have been created with financial supports from the EU and the state. </p>  <p>  Forestry is supported under the Forestry Programme 2014-20  which has now been extended to end 2022, with generous 100% establishment grants, in addition to 15-year premiums for current afforestation scheme contracts and a tax-free asset on maturity.  We will be encouraging farmers, state bodies, communities and businesses to plant trees for both timber and to mitigate against the impacts of climate change. </p>  <p>  All tree species sequester carbon which is only one of the many ecosystem services that trees provide. Forests planted on agricultural land help reduce overall emissions from the land use sector.  </p>  <p>  The level of planting to end of September 2021 is 1,755 hectares. Afforestation licences have a validity period of three years, from date of issue.  </p>  <p>  At present, there are approved licences issued, for sites ready and available to plant covering 5,700 hectares.  </p>  <p>  I encourage anyone with a valid afforestation licence to contact their forester and arrange planting.  Once planted, they may apply for the first of 15 annual premiums.</p>  <p>  It is clear that significant increases in afforestation will be required over the next  decade. I am aware that delays in issuing licences may be a contributory factor in terms of interest in planting.  We are addressing the backlog through the Project Woodland initiative and September was the highest month for licence issue since April 2019.  </p>  <p>  Afforestation licences for almost 3,400 hectares have issued this year and we now have a dedicated team of 10 ecologists working on afforestation files ahead of the planting season. </p>  <p>  It is important that the Department receives good quality applications from applicants and that they respond to any requests for further information.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 550 afforestation files have been referred to ecology for processing by an ecologist.  Officials have examined all these files and found that just over 10% of these files have supporting ecology habitat information.  </p>  <p>  It was highlighted to forestry companies earlier in the summer they should examine their afforestation applications that are referred to the Ecology Unit, and to provide additional ecology information and engage an ecologist as required.  </p>  <p>  While some companies have supplied this information, most applications referred to Ecology do not have this information and in many cases the Department will not be able to process the file without ecology information.  </p>  <p>  Regarding projections for 2022, considering the voluntary nature of the Scheme, it is not possible to determine the area that will be planted. We are examining opportunities to further incentivise afforestation measures in the context of the next forestry programme and the next CAP and the Department will be engaging with all relevant stakeholders over the next 12 months.</p></reply>

Initiatives such as the development of a National Veterinary Prescribing System (NVPS) will help deliver on this ambition. </p>  <p>  The NVPS will result in a prescription being made available to a farmer by choice of email or text.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through its human rights-led approach to policing, seeks to uphold and protect the right to freedom of assembly and protest, while also upholding the law and protecting the public and businesses.  </p>  <p>  Balancing the right to protest with protecting the public and upholding the law is a complex task and the Garda&iacute; review their actions and responses regularly.  I am assured by the Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive detailed training based on a &lsquo;human rights first&rsquo; approach to any protest. This approach was also noted by the Policing Authority in its reports on policing during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  This balance and emphasis on human rights is also reflected in the relevant statutes governing the right to protest and criminal damage, respectively the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Criminal Damage Act 1991. There are no plans to amend the Criminal Damage Act to incorporate a defence of protest.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the enforcement of the law, including those governing protest and criminal damage, are strictly operational matters for the Garda Commissioner. As Minister, I have no direct role in them. Furthermore, the decision to prosecute any member of the public for any crime is strictly a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is completely independent in the exercise of her functions. As Minister, I cannot comment on any decision made by the DPP.</p>  <p>  Once the DPP has decided to prosecute, the outcome of any such prosecution is decided by the Courts, who are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their functions. As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on any ongoing Court proceedings or their outcomes.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance, I have had enquiries and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on Wicklow Town Courthouse. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the existing courthouse building, comprising two courtrooms, is in very poor condition and is currently closed on health and safety grounds. All court business is currently being dealt with at Bray. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service further advises that a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (for example, consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites, etc.) is required to meet current and future demand in Wicklow. This will require a building significantly larger than the existing two courtroom building. The Courts Service proposes to refurbish and extend the courthouse to provide the required accommodation and has acquired a number of adjoining properties that were in council ownership so as to have available a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service remains committed to a redevelopment of Wicklow Courthouse and the revised National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030, includes a number of courthouse development projects, including for Wicklow Town.  The Courts Service is in the process of developing a new estate strategy including development priorities for the period up to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to investing over &euro;270m every year for the next five years in capital projects in the Justice Sector as part of NDP 2021-2030, which represents a significant increase on recent years.

This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including new powers for Garda&iacute; and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.  A subgroup of the forum has recently been established to examine the issue of knife crime.

It was only if the measures failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that an application for a court order would be made.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that no civil orders under section 115 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 were issued in Cork during the period in question. There have been 27 Behaviour Warnings issued under section 114 of the 2006 Act reported across the Cork Divisions this year to date. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the use of behaviour warnings and civil orders are only suitable in certain circumstances, and indeed it is only one crime prevention option open to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling this type of crime. As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  These measures are underpinned by a comprehensive legal framework. Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under - </p>  <p>  - Criminal Damage Act 1991</p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994</p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 and </p>  <p>  - Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I last year established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour.

Our commitment in this area is reflected in the additional funding that has been secured by my Department under Budget 2022.</p><p>A total of &euro;4.9m is being allocated to Victims of Crime. This includes the retention of emergency COVID-19 funding of &euro;400k to address the impact of the pandemic on domestic violence services and an additional &euro;785,000 in direct supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes. This will be important to ensure the momentum gained in supporting victims of domestic and sexual violence throughout the pandemic continues to grow. The additional funding will also ensure that court accompaniment related supports funded by my Department are available to all categories of victims of crime throughout the State. </p><p>An additional &euro;1.1m in funding is being provided for the Legal Aid Board to begin putting in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court to victims of sexual violence. This is part of the vital work we are undertaking as a priority, to introduce important reforms to support and protect vulnerable victims and ensure our criminal justice system is more victim-centred.</p><p>Furthermore, funding of &euro;1m is being made available under the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units.  </p><p>An additional &euro;2.4m has also been secured for specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. This brings to &euro;5.35m the funding available for combatting domestic sexual and gender based violence, which is a priority for me and for my Department. The funding will also play a key role in supporting the preventative focus of the Third National Strategy on domestic sexual and gender based violence which is to be agreed by the end of the year.</p><p>The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p><p>Furthermore, I<b></b>understand that Minister O'Gorman has secured an increase of &euro;41m for Tusla under Budget 2022 which includes the budget for funding organisations that deliver frontline services, including the funding of refuge spaces. </p><p>Since 2014, this part of Tusla's budget has almost doubled from &euro;17.5m to &euro;30m in 2021. While I understand Minister O'Gorman, in consultation with Tusla, is finalising the detailed allocation of funding resources to various programmes and service areas, I am assured that the budget for 2022 will allow Tusla to maintain supports for DSGBV services, which have seen a significant increases in demand in the context of Covid-19, and to progress recommendations emerging from its review of refuge accommodation provision.</p></reply>

This Bill intends to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, the Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. In the preparation of the General Scheme, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System, published in October 2019.   The General Scheme has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p>  <p>  This significant piece of legislation will be a key element of the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable  families, will be central to the new system. </p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Family Justice Oversight Group to agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the Family Court Bill.   The Courts Service is represented on that group, as is the Legal Aid Board.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service launched its Modernisation Programme in the first Quarter of 2021.  One of the four pillars of that Programme is to modernise the current family law structures and one of its goals is the development of a user centric family law service to meet the provisions of the Family Courts Bill.  The Programme&rsquo;s family law pillar will look to reform how services are delivered to family law court users by developing new ICT systems, reforming practices and procedures and delivering services in more family law user centric facilities.</p>  <p>  I understand that preliminary work has been carried out by the Courts Service to identify courthouses around the country that can best accommodate the new family law regional structures but that no decisions have yet been made on these locations. As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including court accommodation, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.</p></reply>

In line with international best practice, a key principle of the new Youth Justice Strategy is providing as many opportunities as possible to enable young people to change direction in their lives and adopt more positive behaviours</p>  <p>  The Strategy includes the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to the court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release. </p>  <p>  The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) and promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives. Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour. The immediate priority within the Strategy is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) across the State.</p>  <p>  YDPs engage with young people through a range of supports, including education, training and  employment support, social enterprise initiatives, as well as personal development and supports such as mentoring and personal development activities. Experience in the operation of the Children Act highlights the need to include children below the age of criminal responsibility (12 for  most offences) in preventative measures, and to consider the extension of  measures to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice system beyond the age of 18.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have also established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and will seek to propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if required, and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p>  <p>  Two subgroups of the forum have also been set up to examine the issues of knife crime and misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Similar sub groups can also be established for other issues as appropriate.</p></reply>

As Minister, I play no direct role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  However, I am informed by Garda Authorities that as of 30 September 2021, 3,974 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are female. This means that 27.7% of sworn Garda members are female and 72.3% male. This compares with 24.4% female and 75.6% male in 2010. </p>  <p>  A concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that its membership reflects the community that it serves, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through online videos and other media to attract female candidates as well as candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. </p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Information Days have been held in advance of closing dates of internal competitions where women are underrepresented. I understand that having women available to answer questions who are already carrying out the particular role advertised is a key feature of the Information Days. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, contains a commitment to increase the diversity within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prioritising the identification and removal of barriers to recruiting and retaining people from diverse and minority background. This work is being taken forward as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy (2020-2021). Work is ongoing to develop a successor Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, a key element of which will focus on addressing under representation of women at all levels of the organisation.</p>  <p>  My Department's Justice Plan 2021 commits to supporting the EDI Strategy to ensure the organisation can attract, retain and develop a diverse and inclusive workforce, including preparation of a diversity recruitment roadmap. </p>  <p>  While the current number of women members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is broadly in line with the percentage of women in police services across England and Wales, there is clearly scope for further improvement. I expect that the above steps being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will ensure that the membership of the organisation can evolve to more closely to reflect the society that it serves.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to implementing the key recommendations in the Expert Advisory Group Report to reduce processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and Establish a New International Protection Support Service.</p>  <p>  The White Paper proposes that the new system should be phased in and operational by 2024 and that the intervening period should provide an opportunity to progress improvements in the overall processing times for international protection.</p>  <p>  My Department intends, in the first instance, to prioritise processing of all cases using improved processes and the planned ICT investment in the system. The International Protection Office of my Department is also examining and implementing measures with a view to speeding up processing times and reducing the overall number of applicants in the protection process. These measures include training more staff to conduct interviews and complete reports, whilst also streamlining processes to assist in expediting applications in the medium to long term. An end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from within my Department, has now been completed and published.</p>  <p>  My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times and based on the outcome of that review, decide by the end of 2022, whether additional measures are required in order to ensure that the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases.</p></reply>

Almost &euro;200,000 in funding has been granted to eight projects; some of which are joint ventures between more than one YDP (a total of 10 YDPs applied for funding, 9 in Dublin, along with additional support provided for Moyross in Limerick).</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that &euro;6.7million has been provided for youth justice services in Budget 2022.

As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has significantly stepped up its dedicated resources in the cyber area in recent years and is continuing to grow its capabilities. The dedicated Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) is led by a Detective Chief Superintendent. As of 30 September, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 45 Garda members attached to GNCCB, and there are plans to continue to expand the Bureau between this year and next, including the recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade. Cyber Satellite Hubs have also recently been established in Cork, Galway, Mullingar and Wexford. These hubs are engaged in cybercrime forensics, investigations and support roles.</p>  <p>  GNCCB is responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime incidents in the State. Both the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the GNCCB continue to engage with telecommunications service providers regarding online scams and the identification of the persons involved in them.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that combatting and preventing fraud and related cybercrime falls under the remit of several Departments and Agencies. There is close cooperation across the whole of Government on this issue, and in particular between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Cyber Security Centre. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that earlier this month I launched a major cybercrime awareness campaign, as part of European Cybersecurity Month. This campaign will see Community Garda&iacute; and Crime Prevention Officers around the country providing information to local communities on how to avoid falling victim to such scams. This will be done through local information events, as well as through the normal engagement Garda&iacute; have with their communities. There are also dedicated radio advertisements being broadcast nationally as part of the campaign.</p>  <p>  Cooperation with our EU and international partners remains a key part of Ireland's response to cybercrime and online scams. Ireland is also committed to ratifying the Council of Europe Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the first binding international treaty on cybercrime, when the necessary legislative requirements have been fulfilled. My Department's Justice Plan 2021 commits to drafting a general scheme of a Cybercrime Bill which will give effect to those provisions of the Budapest Convention not already provided for in Irish law.</p></reply>

As Minister I have no direct role in these matters, but I am assured that the Garda authorities keep this distribution under constant review, to ensure the optimum use of available Garda members.</p><p>The table attached to this answer, which was furnished to me by the Garda authorities, gives the breakdown of the number of Garda members attached to the drugs units in each Garda Division nationwide as of 30 September 2021, the most recent date for which figures are available. I can further advise the Deputy that as of that date, there were 14 full time Garda members assigned to drugs units in the Louth Division.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to disrupt the sale and supply of controlled drugs in communities across the State. Tackling serious crime is a key priority for the Government and I very much welcome the exceptional work which has been undertaken by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) so far this year. This vital work is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.</p><p>From its establishment in March 2016 to the end of 2020, GNDOCB has been responsible for the seizure of in excess of 133 firearms, &euro;209 million worth of illicit drugs, 5,500 rounds of ammunition and &euro;21.7 million in cash. In 2020 alone, GNDOCB seized &euro;36.7 million worth of illicit drugs, 23 firearms, 2,131 rounds of ammunition, &euro;8 million in cash and made 228 arrests.</p><p>The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding. This significant investment by the government has allowed for sustained and ongoing investment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and into recruitment of new Garda&iacute;, including in Louth.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the allocation of the Garda budget between the different Garda units in each Division and nationally is strictly a matter for the Commissioner and his management team. The Commissioner is the accounting officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the law. Within each Garda Division, local Garda management determine the allocation of available resources, in consultation with senior management and based on current operational requirements. As Minister, I have no role in such decisions or allocations. I am advised by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to break down the percentage spend in the manner requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government is determined to tackle anti-social and violent behaviour, and I am very conscious of the impact such behaviour can have on the quality of life for local communities, including in Dublin&rsquo;s city centre. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I recently met with the Garda authorities, Dublin business owners and local representatives to discuss anti-social behaviour in the city centre. The Deputy will also be aware that last week&rsquo;s budget includes significant additional funding to support initiatives under the Youth Justice Strategy and the new Community Safety Innovation Fund which will support community based initiatives to ensure public safety.  </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; continue to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends. This includes specific high visibility operations to tackle anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre in order to reassure citizens, visitors and the business community.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that Operation Soteria is in place to target a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. </p>  <p>  Further, Operation Pier and Operation Spire are underway within Dublin City Centre, in the DMR South Central and North Central Divisions respectively. These operations form the basis of a regional response to city centre street-level drug dealing and possession of drugs, with members performing dedicated patrols in areas known to have a high concentration of such issues. Some key areas targeted are those that have a significant nightlife economy.</p>  <p>  Both operations are undertaken by uniformed and plain-clothes members on a full-time basis, with the objective to investigate, detect, prevent and prosecute criminal offences committed under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A large proportion of these operations focus on high-visibility and pro-active policing and engagement with the residential and business communities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, Minister of State James Browne last year established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p>  <p>  A subgroup of the forum has recently been established to examine the issue of knife crime, with a first meeting of the subgroup taking place on 26 September. This follows a previous subgroup which examined the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Similar sub-groups can also be established for other relevant issues where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Local Community Safety Partnership pilot which is underway in the north inner city, chaired by Mr Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;. Local Community Safety Partnerships are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationwide to all local authority areas after the pilot phase of two years.</p></reply>

These are informed by research and consultation with key stakeholders and engagement with Government Departments as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Following this engagement with stakeholders, my Department is now working to finalise the details for the scheme, including eligibility considerations and qualifying criteria, with a view to bringing a proposal to Government shortly to allow for the launch of the scheme before the end of this year.   </p>  <p>  In finalising a proposal, my Department is examining the implications of the principles underpinning this scheme for various groups who have spent extended periods in the country without an immigration permission to remain. It is not possible at this stage to confirm the details of the scheme until it has been finalised, considered and approved by the Government.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to provide an opportunity to regularise those who have been living for many years in Ireland without a legal status in light of the uncertainty and vulnerability that this brings. Many adults and children are expected to benefit from this scheme, for example through increased career and educational opportunities and enabling those who qualify to get on the pathway to one day applying for Irish citizenship, if they so wish.  </p>  <p>  With regard to citizenship more generally, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.   </p>  <p>  While all legislation is kept under review, there are no plans at the moment to amend the applicable rules relating to undocumented periods of residency for applications for a certificate of naturalisation. However as noted above persons who are accepted under the undocumented scheme will in future be able to qualify for naturalisation.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda resources. I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  I understand that as of 30 September 2021, there are now 3,382 Garda staff (civilians) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I further understand that significant progress continues to be made in relation to the civilianisation process within the organisation. As of 27 September, 820 Garda members have been released from posts not requiring Garda powers or expertise and their duties reassigned to Garda staff. This has in turn facilitated the redeployment of those Garda members to operational duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides for the recruitment of an additional 400 Garda staff and an additional 800 Garda members next year. These extra Garda staff will allow for a further freeing up of Garda&iacute; for frontline duties, and enhance the capacity of the organisation through the recruitment of staff to specialist and other positions to support the investigation of crime and the management and development of the organisation. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner's implementation of the new Garda Operating Model also introduces major changes to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing more front-line Garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility, and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area.  All services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level, to allow greater specialisation and to release Garda&iacute; from back office functions.</p></reply>

It also provides funding to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, which of course includes victims of domestic and sexual crime.</p>  <p>  The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to my Department for this. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable us to roll out specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also allow us to provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes and it will support a number of front line activities. </p>  <p>  As part of this, an additional &euro;1.1m will be used to put in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence and &euro;1 million is being provided to the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is leading the development across government of the third national strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence. This plan will outline how the government will radically improve services and supports for victims and will be the most ambitious plan to date. My Department is also currently implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, our plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, and which was published by Minister McEntee last year. It will reform the criminal justice system at every point a victim comes into contact with it, while a national public awareness campaign on consent will further strengthen work to prevent these crimes. </p>  <p>  The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p>  <p>  As part of our work to combat sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence we are running awareness raising campaigns to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with a view to decreasing and preventing this type of behaviour and violence. </p>  <p>  The final instalment of a three-year awareness campaign on sexual violence, entitled &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; is currently being aired across radio, tv and various other social channels. Work is also underway to develop a national campaign around the meaning and importance of consent in sexual relationships. It is also expected that as part of the Third National Strategy&rsquo;s focus on prevention and informing victims of supports available, there will be new and potentially multi-faceted campaigns required.   </p>  <p>  On the legislative side, a new law enacted earlier this year has introduced preliminary hearings for the first time. This will ensure greater protections for vulnerable victims and witnesses in sexual offences cases. </p>  <p>  'Coco's Law', also referred to as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, entered into force on 10 February 2021. Among other provisions, it broadened the offence of harassment and increased the penalties for the more serious forms of harassment. It also created new offences of sending, or threatening to send, intimate images without the consent of the person whose image it is. </p>  <p>  The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill has completed drafting and it is intended this Bill will be brought to my Government colleagues for approval to publish in the coming weeks. The purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for the assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.  </p>  <p>  Through the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, I am reforming as a priority our criminal justice system, to ensure that vulnerable victims are supported and empowered at every stage of their journey, confident in the knowledge that they will be supported, informed and treated with respect and dignity.</p>  <p>  To date a number of key actions have been delivered including:</p>  <p>  - Legislating for the introduction of preliminary trial hearings;</p>  <p>  - The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU);</p>  <p>  - The first cohort of staff at new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles in April;</p>  <p>  - Work to advance the training for all personnel who come into contact with vulnerable victims is underway;</p>  <p>  - Funding for NGOs providing court accompaniment and related information and support services has been increased;</p>  <p>  - A review of grants for organisations supporting victims has been undertaken to identify gaps in service provision;</p>  <p>  - The University of Limerick has been commissioned to develop the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries and they will soon be engaging with stakeholders to develop this.</p>  <p>  My Department has also undertaken a review of the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services in order to identify where gaps may exist and how to bridge them. This piece of work will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  This work is in addition to the audit of how domestic, sexual and gender-based violence policy and services are organised which was published in July.  The recommendations of this audit, as well as the Tusla Review of accommodation needs and outcome of the mapping exercise undertaken as part of implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey, will play an important role in the development across Government of the Third National Strategy on DSGBV. I intend to have a draft Strategy ready for a further round of public consultation in the coming weeks, and, as already indicated, this Strategy will have a preventative focus.</p></reply>

The main focus of the crime prevention campaigns is burglary prevention and reduction. I am informed that the next campaign is scheduled for 24 November 2021. The National Crime Prevention Unit at Garda Community Engagement Bureau also supports a nationwide network of Crime Prevention Officers. Each Garda division has an appointed Crime Prevention Officer.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware of the National Rural Safety Forum, which brings together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and?the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development, alongside national and local organisations including the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the GAA. The purpose of the Forum is to develop a nationwide network for the distribution of crime prevention advice, increase engagement within communities, and prevent and reduce opportunities for crime.? My Department's Justice Plan 2021 commits to working with the Forum to develop initiatives to promote community safety and to reduce the opportunity for crime throughout the country. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re to cover costs incurred by communities in administering the Text Alert Scheme. The scheme is administered on a refund basis whereby communities submit their annual costs to Muintir na T&iacute;re and a maximum refund of up to &euro;350 is provided to the community. </p><p>For the last two years, my Department has committed to funding of up to &euro;150,000 toward the costs of the scheme and, based on the number of applications received, it has had an average cost of &euro;120,000 per annum. </p><p>My officials have been engaging with Muintir na T&iacute;re in relation to continuing this scheme including reviewing whether newer technologies, including apps, would be appropriate for use. In terms of funding for the 2021 Scheme, a final decision has yet to be made but I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to continuing to support this scheme.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland.

This scheme is based on the model developed by the Moyross Youth Diversion Project (YDP) and, again, is a means of intervention and diversion from this type of activity, rather than enforcement. </p><p>My Department opened applications to all YDPs and interested groups, such as motocross clubs, for funding for these initiatives. Almost &euro;200,000 in funding has been granted to eight projects, some of which are joint ventures between more than one YDP (a total of 10 YDPs applied for funding, 9 in Dublin, along with additional support provided for Moyross in Limerick).</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that &euro;6.7million has been provided for youth justice services in Budget 2022.

This forum will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p>  <p>  Two subgroups of the forum have been set up to examine particular issues, including one on knife crime which met on 26 September, and another on the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Similar sub groups can also be established for other issues as they arise.</p>  <p>  A new Youth Justice Strategy for 2021 &ndash; 2027 was also published on 15 April. In line with international best practice, a key principle of the new Youth Justice Strategy is providing as many opportunities as possible to enable young people to change direction in their lives and adopt more positive behaviours.</p>  <p>  The Strategy includes the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release. </p>  <p>  The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) and promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives. Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots which are underway in 3 locations around the country.  Local Community Safety Partnerships are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationwide to all local authority areas after the pilot phase of two years.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the Garda Commissioner and his team continue to utilise  Operation Soteria to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of assault within communities, prioritise assault investigations, and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. The Operation includes targeting knife crimes in areas where it is shown to be appropriate and necessary. </p>  <p>The operation is based upon five principles for implementation: commitment to protecting people and communities; awareness and education as a crime prevention technique; policing operational efficiency; location management by working in partnership; and offender management.  </p></reply>

These criteria for allocating funding are currently under consideration and will be announced in due course.  </p>  <p>  The approach we are taking will ensure that the best proposals to improve community safety will get the funding they need and will encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best.

It also provides funding to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, which of course includes victims of domestic and sexual crime.</p><p>The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to my Department for this. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable us to roll out specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also allow us to provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes and it will support a number of front line activities. </p><p>As part of this, an additional &euro;1.1m will be used to put in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence and &euro;1 million is being provided to the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is leading the development across government of the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence. This plan will outline how the government will radically improve services and supports for victims and will be the most ambitious plan to date. My Department is also currently implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, our plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, and which was published by Minister McEntee last year. It will reform the criminal justice system at every point a victim comes into contact with it, while a national public awareness campaign on consent will further strengthen work to prevent these crimes. </p><p>The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p><p>Furthermore, I<b></b>understand that Minister O'Gorman has secured an increase of &euro;41m for Tusla under Budget 2022 which includes the budget for funding organisations that deliver frontline services, including the funding of refuge spaces. </p><p>Since 2014, this part of Tusla's budget has almost doubled from &euro;17.5m to &euro;30m in 2021. While I understand Minister O'Gorman, in consultation with Tusla, is finalising the detailed allocation of funding resources to various programmes and service areas, I am assured that the budget for 2022 will allow Tusla to maintain supports for DSGBV services, which have seen a significant increases in demand in the context of Covid-19, and to progress recommendations emerging from its review of refuge accommodation provision.</p></reply>

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy, which emphasises a health-led approach to addressing the challenge of drugs in our society, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes responsibility for decisions on the distribution of resources and personnel. As Minister, I have no direct role in this matter. </p>  <p>  However I can assure the Deputy that the continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. A concerted effort has been made over the past year to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital support of public health guidelines.</p>  <p>On 2   July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  I am advised that three operations are underway in the Tipperary Division to tackle criminality related to drugs. Operation Overwatch is a divisional operation under the auspices of Operation Tara to target the sale and supply of drugs and that, as part of this operation, an intelligence-led operation is currently focused on the supply of drugs within the division, utilising support from Regional Units.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that Operation Raffle is an anti-drugs operation specific to the Clonmel District and that Operation Geall is targeting offenders involved in organised crime, including drug trafficking, in the Tipperary Division.</p>  <p>  The number of Garda members attached to the Tipperary Drugs Unit, as at 15 October 2021, is 1 Sergeant and 10 Garda&iacute;. The members of this unit also work collaboratively with all Garda&iacute; in the community.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Since 2016 the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%. This has enabled 1,400 extra Garda&iacute; to be deployed, as well as continued investment in modern equipment. In addition, we have freed up 800 Garda&iacute; for front line policing work through the recruitment of Garda staff.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, Covid-19 restrictions on the Garda Training College in Templemore constrained recruitment and training for periods over the last 18 months. However, I am glad to confirm that 450 Garda&iacute; will be recruited this year and the funding provided for next year fully supports the sustained recruitment of Garda members and staff. </p><p>In particular, the funding announced last week includes provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - an additional 1,200 personnel. The number of new recruits and new Garda staff envisaged means that we are on track to meet the Government&rsquo;s target of 15,000 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 4,000 Garda staff as we approach the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s establishment.</p><p>This increase in the number of Garda members and staff will deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and improved services to the public generally. Redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year, thus allowing highly trained Garda&iacute; to focus on frontline policing duties.  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including to specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation  <b>.</b></p><p>Budget 2022 provides an additional &euro;10.5 million for Garda operational expenditure &ndash; including provision for new mobile devices, equipment for a range of Garda specialist units and on-going training in relation to priority areas such as tackling sexual, domestic and gender based violence. It also includes a specific once&ndash;off allocation of &euro;1.5 million to mark the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022.</p><p>Budget 2022 also includes provision for a capital budget of &euro;147 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ICT and Building Programme and ongoing investment in the organisation&rsquo;s transport fleet. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, recognising the need to be visible and accessible in communities but also conscious of taking proactive actions to reduce their carbon footprint, will purchase an additional 100 mountain bikes and increased numbers of Electrical Vehicles as part of an overall fleet management strategy.</p><p>The budget will also ensure continuing investment in the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, with ongoing expansion of the Bureau between this year and next, including the recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade. </p></reply>

Experience in the operation of the Children Act highlights the need to include children below the age of criminal responsibility (12 for  most offences) in preventative measures, and to consider the extension of measures to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice system beyond the age of 18.</p><p>The additional &euro;6.7m provided for in Budget 2022 represents an increase of one third in support for youth justice services. It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports made available through local YDP services. The main elements are: </p><p>- Establishment of a limited number of new youth projects and boundary extensions of existing projects so as to ensure that the youth diversion services are available throughout the State by  end-2022 or shortly thereafter.</p><p>- Enhancement of the youth diversion service, in accordance with identified local needs, to include:</p><p>- Early intervention and family support work</p><p>- Outreach with harder-to-engage young people</p><p>- Support for schools to retain challenging children</p><p>- Other specific initiatives e.g. in relation to anti-social use of scramblers and knife crime issues.</p><p>- Dedicated research and expert support, including best practice support for the nationwide project network, facilitated by the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project team in the University of Limerick.</p></reply>

However, is a requirement of the naturalisation process that a current passport must accompany every application. The identity of every applicant must be confirmed to the greatest extent possible and a passport is a primary identifier.  </p>  <p>  At this time applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons or require their passports for official reasons.  In these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk at citizenshipinfo@justice.ie with the relevant details. Any request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material, for example, in the case of travel, detailing the reasons for travel, such as medical information. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are just over 22,200 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received, to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready", and my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications. </p>  <p>  In January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Almost 6,200 certificates have been issued so far and a further 1,000 people will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. My Department has prioritised the oldest applications on hand and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates since the start of the year.</p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. </p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.  </p>  <p>  I am also pleased to confirm that, subject to public health guidelines, my Department intends to host an in-person citizenship ceremony on 13 December in Killarney - the first since the pandemic began in March 2020.</p></reply>

This broader, health led response is key to the National Drugs and Alcohol Strategy, &lsquo;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery&rsquo;, which is being led by my colleague Minister Frank Feighan. Garda&iacute; work closely with local authorities, HSE, NGOs, community groups and other state agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse. </p></reply>

My Department is working closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure a coordinated national response.</p>  <p>  This includes opening the Irish Refugee Protection Programme under Minister O'Gorman's remit to Afghan persons in need of protection and working to ensure that applications received from Afghan nationals under the various State schemes for immigration residence and international protection can be prioritised for speedier processing where possible.  These schemes provide avenues for Afghan nationals to seek protection and for eligible family members living in Ireland to seek to have their close family members granted permission to reside in Ireland, where the relevant criteria are met. More than 740 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year. </p>  <p>  Myself and Minister Humphreys secured Government approval for an additional initiative: the special Afghan Admission Programme which will provide places for up to 500 Afghan family members. Each applicant will have an opportunity to nominate up to four family members who are currently residing in Afghanistan or who have fled to neighbouring territories and whom they consider would be especially at risk in terms of their freedom and safety.  </p>  <p>  The Programme, including the detailed eligibility criteria and the application process, will be developed over the coming months, with a view to issuing a call for applications in December.</p>  <p>  The timescale provided is to ensure that the options considered are as inclusive as possible and that the programme is available to those that most require our help. The intervening time is required to develop the details of the programme, including a guidance document for applicants, application form, decision making criteria and the appeals process. The clearer the application process is made at the outset, the quicker we will be able to process applications in the interests of those concerned.</p>  <p>  The Programme is unique across the EU and was hailed by the UNHCR as a very welcome commitment by Ireland that will bring much solace to Afghans who are worried about their relatives abroad.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, all current immigration avenues remain open for new applications, including visa and family reunification applications. My Department will process any new applications received speedily and sympathetically.</p></reply>

It is not open to me as Minister to comment on any aspect of the Judge's work or the process of compiling the final report. My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. </p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would wish, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I am informed the process is now at the stage of seeking comments on various sections of the report from the parties named in it, including my Department.  I also understand that Judge Haughton has been in touch with the O'Farrell family regarding this matter. Following receipt of responses from all relevant parties, it is understood that Judge Haughton will be in a position to finalise his report. My Department will continue to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge, and I look forward to receiving his final report in due course.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of the final report, in line with established process, the advice of the Attorney General will be sought on publication and any other issues arising.</p></reply>

Experience in the operation of the Children Act highlights the need to include children below the age of criminal responsibility (12 for  most offences) in preventative measures, and to consider the extension of measures to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice system beyond the age of 18.</p><p>The additional &euro;6.7m provided for in Budget 2022 represents an increase of one third in support for youth justice services. It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports made available through local YDP services. The main elements are: </p><p>- Establishment of a limited number of new youth projects and boundary extensions of existing projects so as to ensure that the youth diversion services are available throughout the State by end-2022 or shortly thereafter.</p><p>- Enhancement of the youth diversion service, in accordance with identified local needs, to include:</p><p>- Early intervention and family support work</p><p>- Outreach with harder-to-engage young people</p><p>- Support for schools to retain challenging children</p><p>- Other specific initiatives e.g. in relation to anti-social use of scramblers and knife crime issues.</p><p>- Dedicated research and expert support, including best practice support for the nationwide project network, facilitated by the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project team in the University of Limerick.</p></reply>

Remote working won&rsquo;t work for everyone, so we will take a balanced approach with the legislation.</p>  <p>  Informed by the public consultation and a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill has commenced and I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of Heads of a Bill in Quarter 4 of 2021. The Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we will also continue to provide up to date advice, guidance and information on all aspects of remote working for workers and employers. </p>  <p>On 28th June I launched my department&rsquo;s Making Remote Work campaign. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the advice and information available from Government to help workers and employers facilitate more remote and blended working.

For 2021, &euro;3.84m was originally ring-fenced by the NTA from the Capital Programme to the Lift and Escalator Renewal Programme. An additional &euro;2m was allocated to the Programme in November 2020, as part of Budget 2021, bringing the total allocated to the Lifts and Escalator Renewal Programme to &euro;5.84m this year.

This is because they were not serving in Revenue on 1 January 2003 (Integration Day), the designated date by reference to which eligibility for payment of the APTH was determined. </p>  <p>  The background is that following an extensive industrial relations negotiation process in 2002/2003, widespread communication and staff engagement, agreement was reached on the rationalisation and integration of General Service and Departmental Taxes grading structures in Revenue. Arising from the agreement, 1 January 2003 was designated as Integration Day and as of that date, Departmental Taxes grades were ceased, the individuals who were serving in those grades took on the duties and conditions of service of the equivalent General Service grades; and they were re-certified by the Civil Service Commission to General Service grades.</p>  <p>  As part of the Integration Agreement, a promotion/upgrading process was agreed and those individuals who were serving in Revenue on Integration Day and were not successful in the process, were instead awarded an Annual Personal to Holder Payment (APTH), an allowance paid on a personal-to-holder basis, in addition to the existing salary point on an incremental scale, for as long as the person remains in that grade. Revenue staff who are still in receipt of an APTH are those who met the criteria above and who currently serve in the same grade in which they served on Integration Day, 1 January 2003. However, staff who were recruited or transferred into Revenue, or who returned from Career Break after Integration Day were not, and are not, eligible for the APTH payment. </p>  <p>  Revenue confirms that an extensive review was carried out by the appropriate Personnel Officer at the request of the individual in question. A comprehensive reply issued directly to the individual in question on 19 November 2020, explaining why an APTH is not payable in this specific case.</p></reply>

Having considered the possible inequities and administrative challenges of such an exemption or waiver structure the group recommended instead a deferral scheme that would assist property owners in a number of different scenarios including low income.  The interdepartmental group recommended that where taxpayers are entitled to, and have elected for, deferral of LPT, interest due on deferred payments should be at a lower rate to the rate charged on overdue LPT which is 8% per annum. The Government accepted these recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax if certain conditions are met. Any LPT that is deferred between 2013 and 2021 carries an interest charge of 4% per annum.  Interest will accrue on the deferred amount until such time that it is paid off. In providing for the possibility of deferral of the tax, the reduced rate of interest recognises that the circumstances in which a person defers the tax charge are very different from those where the property owner simply fails to pay the tax. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Interdepartmental LPT Review Group recommended that the income thresholds for LPT deferrals should be reviewed regularly by reference to (i) movements in the CPI, (ii) wage growth in the economy, and (iii) changes in fixed income payments by the State. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that from the next valuation date of 1 November 2021, the deferral thresholds will increase to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple. This is an increase of 20% in these thresholds. </p>  <p>  A review of the interest rate on deferred LPT also took place this year, in advance of the next LPT valuation period (i.e. 2022 to 2025).  The review took account of the Covid initiative on the warehousing of tax debts, in respect of which a reduced interest rate of 3% applies for late payment of outstanding liabilities.  In the interests of consistency and fairness, the Government decided to reduce the LPT deferral rate to 3%.  The 3% rate will apply to any LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022.  It will also apply to any LPT that was deferred between 2013 and 2021, to the extent that it is still outstanding in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral there are a wide number of phased payment options available to assist with budgeting. The various options are designed to provide the maximum possible flexibility for individual circumstances. Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has engaged extensively with individual taxpayers experiencing difficulties paying taxes due to the pandemic to agree flexible arrangements that best suit their circumstances, including in respect of LPT liabilities and will continue to fully engage with taxpayers facing tax payment difficulties.</p></reply>

Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinational companies (MNEs) with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners has estimated that the cost of the agreement could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. This  figure is included in the Stability Programme Update, the Summer Economic Statement (SES), and in the medium term forecast included in Budget 2022. This is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. For the purpose of calibrating this medium-term forecast, the impact of international tax reform is very tentatively estimated &ndash; in terms of revenue foregone &ndash; at &euro;2 billion relative to baseline by 2025; the revenue impact is phased in from 2023.  </p>  <p>  In respect to the exercise to estimate the cost of the agreement, it is important to note that there have been significant changes in recent months to the original proposals, both in relation to Pillar One, in which there is now a higher re-allocation than was originally foreseen, and on Pillar Two through the adoption of a 15% minimum rate as well as the introduction of substance based carve-outs based on the carrying value of assets and payroll. The substance based carve-out is expected to offer relief to taxpayers from the minimum effective rate but this is difficult to estimate as it will be firm specific. Indeed, predicting how individual companies may react to a potential new tax regime is very difficult.</p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that while there is now a broad high level agreement in place on the main features of a solution, discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the agreement will be implemented in practice. For instance, the discussions on Pillar One will need to examine the rules in respect to reallocation from entities within a group. Further, it remains to be seen what additional tax will be paid by MNEs under Pillar Two when substance based carve-out rules are applied which can reduce the effective tax rate paid by an MNE. In terms of further complexity, the final agreement on these carve-outs include a 10 year transition period where the carve-out percentage is reduced year-on-year. </p>  <p>  A further consideration is that although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.</p>  <p>  For all these reasons, I do not believe that I yet have sufficient grounds to revise the working estimate of a potential annual cost of up to &euro;2 billion that I have used in assessing the potential impact of the agreement on the public finances.</p>  <p>  As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many businesses, including in recreational and leisure areas, such as the mobile sauna business, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. </p>  <p>  One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), published last week, shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan can continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that, where goods are imported into Ireland from a third country like Great Britain, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT.  Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods; usually this will be the purchase price, plus the cost of transport and insurance, plus any customs duties payable.</p>  <p>  The VAT treatment of agents depends on their legal status.  In general, where an agent is the de facto importer of the goods, then the agent is responsible for the payment of the VAT on imports.  In such a case, the agent may qualify to use the Postponed Accounting arrangements which were introduced under last year&rsquo;s Brexit Act.  These new rules allow an accountable person to self-account for VAT on imports on their normal VAT3 Return.  The benefit of this is that instead of having to pay VAT up-front at the time of importation, the accountable person may wait until they are making their VAT3 return and, subject to the usual rules on VAT deductibility, they can reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared.  The Postponed Accounting arrangements are intended to alleviate cash flow issues where VAT-registered businesses might otherwise have to pay import VAT at the point of importation of goods and then wait until their next VAT return is filed before they could recover the VAT.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that different procedures are in place for agents who are not the importer of the goods.  I would recommend that the taxpayer uses the MyEnquiries facility within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to confirm the appropriate tax treatment that applies to their particular circumstances.  Further information is also available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macroprudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. </p>  <p>  The mortgage measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by relevant financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. The LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For first-time buyers, the LTV limit is 90% of the value of the residential property, (i.e. a deposit of 10%). </p>  <p>  While regulated lenders must comply with the various rules within the macro prudential and consumer protection frameworks, the extension of credit by lenders to potential customers is a commercial decision for the lender themselves and each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies. </p>  <p>  Before providing a mortgage, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that in general, lenders do take rental payments into account when making their affordability assessment as part of regular underwriting process, to assess borrowers&rsquo; ability to repay a mortgage.  However, there is no Central Bank guidance or guidelines to lenders specifically in relation to their consideration of rent being paid by mortgage applicants in the context of their mortgage applications. This is for each bank to determine and to set out in its credit policy and it is therefore not an issue that I can instruct the Central Bank or lenders on.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a mortgage is the largest liability that most households will take on in their lifetime. It comes with less flexibility than a rental contract, leaving borrowers more exposed to shocks to incomes, house prices and interest rates in the future.  The ability to make regular repayments &ndash; evidenced through rental payments &ndash; does not substitute for the protection for borrowers in having a deposit. A mortgage deposit acts as a cushion of housing equity, and can help households to absorb house price falls without the borrower falling into negative equity.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Central Bank is carrying out a review of the framework for the mortgage measures throughout 2021 and 2022, in parallel to its regular annual reviews of the calibration of the measures to ensure they continue to remain fit for purpose.  The Central Bank has advised that this review will provide it an opportunity to examine a range of topics including but not limited to the objectives of the mortgage measures, the choice of tools and the framework and strategy used for calibration.  The evolution of the housing and mortgage markets since 2015 and that the availability of new data sources (such as the central credit register) will inform the Bank's analysis. Given the widespread international use of mortgage measures, the Central Bank has also advised that it will also analyse how different countries implement and evaluate their macro prudential measures to ensure it takes international learning and best practice into its review. </p></reply>

Such occupier types range from non-profit community and voluntary groups, administrative, sporting, educational, health and cultural organisations among others.   </p>  <p>  For example, the closure of certain Garda stations provided an opportunity to license these properties to a range of community/voluntary non-profit groups.  In addition, the OPW has historically provided accommodation for cultural organisations such as the National Print Museum and the Labour History Museum, as well as making land and pitches available to a range of sporting bodies, or leasing land to the farming community for grazing or tilling.</p>  <p>  In general, these agreements are on the basis that the organisations are in a position to fully insure, repair and maintain the properties in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer.  The question of charging rent is influenced by factors that include historical arrangements and the nature of the occupier and its activities.  </p>  <p>  Similar to local authorities, the OPW has historically sought to optimise the use of its property, that would otherwise cost the State, in a way that supports the property needs of certain non-profit organisations, where it is feasible to do so and where it has been determined that the property will be retained in the portfolio for the foreseeable future. </p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes and decisions in relation to exemptions is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020 provide that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Acts. However, Paragraphs 4, 4A and 4B of Schedule 4 provide for certain exemptions for property directly occupied for sporting purposes.</p>  <p>  Land developed for sport, such as a playing pitch, has a long standing exemption from rateability. Paragraphs 4A and 4B of Schedule 4, added by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for the exemption of property used exclusively for community sport and otherwise than for profit. </p>  <p>  As a result of the changes made by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, it is normally property registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 and used for the sale and consumption of alcohol and property used to generate other commercial type income that is rateable. Income from membership fees and income from community organisations and participants in community sport using buildings does not result in a property occupied by a sports club and used for community sport purposes being deemed rateable. </p>  <p>  I recognise the positive contribution made by sport&rsquo;s clubs in their community and on the whole, much property occupied by sports clubs is exempt from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts are very specific about the range of exemptions that can be applied by the Commissioner.  Where a property occupier is unsure as to the position of their property being rateable or exempt, they should contact the Valuation Office by e-mail at valuationservices@valoff.ie.</p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts.  Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.  There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

These arrangements involve the introduction of additional bed capacity to ensure that there is shelter available for individuals experiencing homelessness who may be at risk of rough sleeping.  Depending on the particular local requirements, local authorities may also introduce additional measures such as extended opening hours of homeless facilities and extended outreach services.</p>  <p>  The cold weather arrangements are typically introduced in November and additional funding is provided by my Department to meet the costs associated with these measures.  Since my appointment, I have been working closely with the local authorities, including the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE), on a range of homeless issues including the arrangements for the winter period.  I understand that the DRHE is currently preparing its cold weather response which will be activated shortly.  From my engagement with local authorities, it is my understanding that they can and do exercise discretion in ensuring that the most vulnerable on our streets do not end up sleeping without shelter due to a lack of a local connection to the area, particularly during cold weather periods.</p></reply>

Local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic. </p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, given that a mortgage is a long-term commitment. </p>  <p>  Where such persons are approved for an RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post PUP/EWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. </p>  <p>  This is not a blanket ban and local authorities can use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate.   This discretion was set out in Circulars 19 and 29 of 2020 and 9 of 2021.</p>  <p>  There are further exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on PUP/EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income. For applicants whose post PUP/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  </p>  <p>  In addition, persons currently on the PUP/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-PUP/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am precluded by housing legislation from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in the provision of social housing support in individual cases.</p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in "Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland", the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

Their activities are planned based on the risk posed to the environment and what is deemed a priority. Information on the number of inspections carried out, non-compliances identified, enforcement activities and prosecutions by local authorities is outlined in the latest activity report on Local Authority Environmental Enforcement available on the EPA&rsquo;s website:www.epa.ie/publications/compliance--enforcement/public-authorities/focus-on-local-authority-environmental-enforcement---activity-report-2019.php .</p>  <p>   The River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021 sets out the actions that Ireland will take to improve water quality and achieve &lsquo;good&rsquo; ecological status in water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters) by 2027 and meet the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>  <p>   This Plan identified 190 Priority Areas for Action (PAA) around which the Local Authority Waters Programme&rsquo;s (LAWPRO) work is concentrated. These catchment areas have been prioritised for focussed scientific assessment to understand the issues affecting water quality. Working with local communities, landowners, business owners and public bodies, LAWPRO then seeks to develop relevant and workable solutions to identified issues.</p>  <p>   This work involves a multidisciplinary and cross-agency approach, working with stakeholders such as the EPA and the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP).  The ASSAP provides 30 sustainability advisors who work collaboratively with farmers in these PAAs. Funded by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the dairy industry, the progromme provides farmers with free advice and support that will enable them to contribute to the protection and enhancement of water quality. A voluntary and collaborative service, ASSAP aims to improve the water quality of these catchments by working together without the need for penalties or restrictions.</p>  <p>   The first Step of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in a PAA, is to improve the scientific understanding by gathering and collating all relevant and available data into a Desktop Study Report.  This ensures there is a focus on the issues that are significantly affecting water quality and the mitigation actions that need to be prioritised.  </p>  <p>   Another important aspect of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in the PAA&rsquo;s is informing and working with local communities. Following their desktop studies and prior to commencing their fieldwork assessments, LAWPRO organises a community information meeting to discuss the water body with local people and interest groups. Local meetings are followed by farmer engagement events organised by advisors from ASSAP, with the support of LAWPRO staff.</p>  <p>   Environmental scientists then walk the catchment and take samples throughout to determine the water quality. Using this data, local knowledge and data previously collected, they will identify the pressures within the catchment that threaten the catchments water quality.</p>  <p>   Once the fieldwork is concluded and analysed, LAWPRO discuss the outcome of the assessment with the relevant implementing bodies or landowners, agreeing timelines for implementation of measures to improve water quality. The advisors from the ASSAP will discuss any agricultural measures with the farmers. With the assistance of the farmer, the ASSAP advisor will seek to identify the main source of pollution to the catchment and agree the draft actions to be acted upon. In many cases, these can be simple adjustments to management practices such as the better use of fertilisers to minimise their runoff into waterways.</p>  <p>   I understand that while work in the PAA&rsquo;s is being undertaken by ASSAP, local authorities have agreed not to carry out routine water inspections on farms within these catchments. However, other routine inspections such as discharge licenses, private drinking water supplies and septic tanks, along with non-routine inspections including pollution incidents and complaints, are still being investigated in these areas. This decision will be continually reviewed as part of the local authorities&rsquo; ongoing development of annual enforcement plans.</p>  <p>   Further information in relation to the PAA&rsquo;s is available on LAWPRO&rsquo;s website at www.lawaters.ie/priority-areas-for-action/, with additional information on water quality and the status of waters available on www.catchments.ie  .  </p>  <p>   As key commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is currently preparing a new strengthened River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. Further advancing Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the new plan will build on the work of the second-cycle, again describing the main pressures and activities affecting water status and setting out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027. The plan will also identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including proposed changes to the approach taken to Areas for Action. </p>  <p>  A draft copy of this plan was recently published for public consultation, details of which are available on the department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/draftRBMP  . </p></reply>

The remaining 20% of LPT is currently re-distributed via the Local Government Fund to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the country.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that local authorities may vary their LPT rate by up to 15%; authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, while local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income.  Neither Galway County Council nor Galway City Council has opted to avail of this opportunity for 2021 or 2022.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. </p>  <p>  The allocations for 2022 are based on the 2021 yield.  When detailed information on the new LPT yield becomes available following the revaluation process, the matter will be revisited.  Any changes to the allocation process and baselines may be considered in that context.</p></reply>

This is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils that underpin the Primary Languages Curriculum (PLC), the Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) and curricular provision in senior cycle.  </p><p>Differentiation is  a  way  of  teaching  in  which  teachers  proactively  modify curriculum,  teaching  methods,  resources,  learning  activities,  and  student products in line with the identified needs of an individual and/or small groups of learners to maximize the learning opportunity for each learner in the classroom.  The aim of differentiation is to ensure that the student can engage in purposeful and  meaningful  learning  activities  and  to  increase  student  motivation  and enjoyment in order to support them in engaging  with increasingly challenging  tasks  over  time.Teachers  should  adapt  teaching  activities  and  resources  in order that they build on the student&rsquo;s identified strengths in response to need.  Factors to consider  when differentiating the curriculum include: differentiation bycontent;differentiationbyprocess;differentiationbyproduct,and differentiation by environment.  To  effectively  differentiate,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  distinctive characteristics and learning styles of individual students.</p><p>The Primary Language Curriculum is for children of all abilities in all school contexts. This is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all students that underpin the Primary Languages Curriculum. It recognises and supports students&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. It builds on the language knowledge and experience that students bring to the school. The Progression Continua in the Primary Language Curriculum provide a framework for teachers to identify the student&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages. </p><p>The specification for Junior Cycle Irish aims to consolidate and deepen the students&rsquo; knowledge, understanding, values and language skills supporting their personal, cognitive and social development. The learning outcomes presented in the specification apply to all students.All pupils are encouraged to study Irish and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their needs and ability.</p><p>The appeals process as set out in the circulars, is focused solely on the process the school engaged in reaching its decision.  The Irish Exemptions Appeals Committee (IEAC) will consider how the school followed the process as prescribed in the circulars and accompanying guidelines. </p><p>I have noted the particular distinguishing aspects of this case and I have asked my officials to make contact with the school in question.</p></reply>

Increasing this to &euro;7.60 will bring the weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with Blind Pension,</p>  <p>   - One Parent Family and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means. </p>  <p>  - The WSS base subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability will increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour from January 2022. </p>  <p>  Other changes introduced in recent years included establishing a fast-track reapplication process for people with disabilities who take up employment but subsequently lose that employment, enabling people with a long term disability to retain their free travel pass for 5 years if they take up employment and removing the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative&rsquo; nature, where a person in receipt of Disability Allowance wishes to undertake employment, has been removed.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Section 59 of the Act provides for similar arrangements through a grant or contribution in kind to non-profit organisations for services supplemental to those provided by the Agency. Such services are commissioned under a formal Service Level Agreement and assist Tusla to fulfil its statutory responsibilities and deliver on the Agency's strategic objectives. </p>  <p>  Each organisation funded under these arrangements operate independently of Tusla. Each is responsible for the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which individuals are employed. Section 56(14) of the Act of 2013 stipulates that &lsquo;an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014 some of the organisations now funded under section 56 were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. In October 2018 the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reached agreement between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 39 organisations. Pay restoration in relation to organisations funded through section 39 was applied to organisations who met certain specific criteria. The criteria related to the organisations rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The criteria included only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process. Pay restoration was limited and solely applicable to those organisations included in the initial WRC agreement. This process has reached a final resolution and there is no scope to revisit eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with colleagues in Government, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of voluntary organisations and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland. I greatly appreciate the tremendous contribution made by the Community and Voluntary sector in supporting Tusla to deliver on its challenging mandate.</p></reply>

The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards costs such as food, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills, books/class materials and costs associated with childcare, transport and medical.

As part of this extended remit, the HEA has been working with stakeholders to advance work in the area of race equality. In order to build a strong evidence base for future policy and funding decisions, the Higher Education Authority conducted this national survey of staff in higher education to develop a picture of race equality across the Irish higher education sector.</p><p>This report is extremely important as it gives us, for the first time, data in relation to the experience of staff from minority ethnic groups in Irish higher education. It highlights that higher education institutions have an opportunity to play a critical role in relation to racial inequalities in wider society. There is an opportunity for higher education to become a beacon of good practice in this area. This report is the first of its kind in this area and will help HEIs to keep pace with wider demographic changes in Irish society. Through the implementation of the recommendations of this report, the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion will continue to advance race equality in higher education in collaboration with HEIs, their representative bodies and other key stakeholders. </p><p>A central recommendation of this report is the systematic collection of data which will provide the necessary evidence base regarding staff and student representation, access and outcome by ethnicity. From December 2020, as part of the HEA&rsquo;s ongoing work in the area of staff equality, diversity and inclusion, HEIs have been requested to return staff ethnicity data to the HEA. This is in addition to the collection of data on HEI staff by gender. To foreground this request, the Athena SWAN Ireland Intersectionality Working Group was established in 2019 by the National Committee for Athena SWAN in Ireland in conjunction with the HEA, with an initial goal to develop a cross-sectoral approach to collecting data on staff and student ethnicity in the Irish higher education sector. The group is open to staff members from HEIs with academic or professional expertise in this area as well as representatives from the HEA. This current focus on ethnicity data and race equality was specifically called for by HE stakeholders (particularly in relation to Athena SWAN requirements).</p><p>In May 2020, the Intersectionality Working Group produced a statement (<i>hea.ie/assets/uploads/2020/07/Intersectionality-WG-Statement-on-Ethnicity-Categories-in-Irish-HE.pdf </i>) to provide staff in HEIs with information on the rationale for collecting ethnicity data and the complexities of categorisation. The statement also provides some context for race equality work in higher education, as well as recommended actions for HEIs to consider. The statement has been endorsed by 25 HEIs, as well as by the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association. In their statement the working group recommended that &ldquo;the Irish higher education sector moves to create an evidence base regarding staff and student representation, access and outcome by ethnicity with the explicit purpose of recognising and tackling institutionalised racism and advancing equality in higher education.&rdquo;</p><p>The findings of this survey highlighted potential variances in earnings across different ethnic groups. The next step is to ensure we have a comprehensive data set in relation to the ethnicity of HE staff. Due to the historical absence of such data, the HEA is working proactively with HEIs to ensure that such data is collected and provided to the HEA on an annual basis in order to monitor progress in this area. The proposed HEA legislation will allow for better collection of staff data across all equality grounds, including information on the ethnic breakdown of staff across our institutions.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding. Since 2016, the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%. This has enabled 1400 extra Garda&iacute; to be deployed, as well as continued investment in modern equipment. In addition, we have freed up 800 Garda&iacute; for front line policing work through the recruitment of Garda staff.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, Covid-19 restrictions on the Garda Training College in Templemore constrained recruitment and training for periods over the last 18 months. However, I am glad to confirm that 450 Garda&iacute; will be recruited this year and the funding provided for next year fully supports the sustained recruitment of Garda members and staff. </p><p>In particular, the funding announced last week includes provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - an additional 1,200 personnel. This increase in the number of Garda members and staff will deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and improved services to the public generally.  Redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year, thus allowing highly trained Garda&iacute; to focus on frontline policing duties.  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including to specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation  <b>.</b></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, by law the detection of and response to any criminal activity is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, as laid down in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. As Minister, I have no direct role in such matters.</p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the distribution of resources among the various Garda Divisions across the State is kept under constant review, in light of emerging crime trends and operational needs. </p><p>The operational review of crime statistics, at a national and regional level, is also the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

Improving community safety requires a multi-sectoral approach, strong inter-agency collaboration and engagement from the community. To achieve this, three pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships have been established, before being rolled out nationwide with the anticipated enactment of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. The partnerships will replace and expand the remit of the Joint Policing Committees by providing a forum for residents and community representatives, including representatives of youth, new communities and the voluntary sector and business and education representatives, along with the relevant State agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, Tusla and others. </p><p>The Local Community Safety Partnerships will provide a dedicated communication channel for input and the development of Local Community Safety Plans to reflect and respond to the self-identified needs of that community.</p></reply>

This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the current pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>I can inform the Deputy that on 2   July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. Recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of an estimated &euro;1.18 million worth of cannabis in Kilkenny on 7 October 2021, and &euro;100,000 worth of cannabis herb in Allenwood, Co. Kildare on 9 October.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Courts Service that statistics relating to drug convictions, broken down by District and Circuit Court cases, are published each year in the Courts Service&rsquo;s annual report and can be found on the Courts Service website at www.courts.ie/annual-report.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that membership of criminal gangs is not noted by the Courts Service during the course of criminal cases.</p></reply>

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the granting of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty has traditionally been considered by the courts to prohibit pre-trial detention except where it appeared that the accused person, if released on bail, was likely to evade justice by absconding or interfering with witnesses or evidence.</p>  <p>  In the light of concerns at the increase in the incidence of offences committed while on bail, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to allow the courts to refuse bail where there are grounds for believing that the accused will commit serious offences while on bail. The referendum was passed and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this constitutional amendment which permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017 amended the Bail Act 1997 to make further provision in respect of the criteria to be considered in refusing bail. The 2017 Act strengthened the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  It is also open to judges to refuse bail for a serious offence where that is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.</p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.  If an individual fails to comply with any of the bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant. This gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.  In the event of a breach of High Court bail, an application is made to the High Court for a warrant and once arrested the defendant must be brought before the High Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge. The judge may also make an order and/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I am advised by Garda authorities that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and have assisted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the threat of organised crime.</p></reply>

This will benefit both claimants, in terms of quicker resolution of claims with an objective assessment of quantum, and the State as the respondent, in terms of lower legal and administrative costs.  The publication of the Bill meets a commitment in my Department's Justice Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021 is currently before the Seanad.  </p></reply>

Under Section 33 of the Act, the Commissioner shall determine the distribution and deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions. </p><p>It is my understanding that those members who are designated as 'Community Garda&iacute;' are members who are engaged primarily in outreach work with community groups, such as providing talks to schools. </p><p>However, community engagement has been a defining feature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since its establishment almost 100 years ago. This extends far beyond those Garda&iacute; who have the official designation of a &lsquo;Community Garda&rsquo;, rather it is at the heart of the work of every member of the service. Daily, Garda&iacute; encounter those who are vulnerable and who are often disproportionately impacted by crime. All Garda&iacute; routinely engage with members of the community as well as the various community and voluntary groups active within any given area. The relationships built up form the basis of all local policing in the State and are part of every Garda&rsquo;s work. </p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of the number of designated Community Garda&iacute; assigned by rank, station and division as of 30 September, the latest date for when figures are available. </p><p><b>Community Garda&iacute; as on 30/09/2021</b> <table>

As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.  </p><p>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 (as amended) provides the statutory basis for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.

Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, as provided in the Children Act 2001. Each such case is assessed and the Director of the Garda Diversion Programme, who is generally a Garda Superintendent, decides if the case is suitable or not for inclusion.</p><p>The operation of the programme includes informal and formal Garda warnings, delivered in the presence of parents or guardians, as well as provision for supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 30 September, the latest date for when figures are available, the following table shows the number of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers by Division and rank.  <table>    <tr>       <th><br /><br />Division</th>       <th><br /><br />Sergeant</th>       <th><br /><br />Garda</th>       <th><br /><br />Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />Cavan/Monaghan</td>       <td><br /><br /></td>       <td><br /><br />2</td>       <td><br /><br />2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />Clare</td>       <td><br /><br /></td>       <td><br /><br />1</td>       <td><br /><br />1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />Cork City</td>       <td><br /><br />1</td>       <td><br /><br />6</td>       <td><br /><br />7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />Cork North</td>       <td><br /><br /></td>       <td><br /><br />3</td>       <td><br /><br />3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />Cork West</td>       <td><br /><br /></td>       <td><br /><br />2</td>       <td><br /><br />2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><br /><br />D.M.R.

The service has grown over the years in line with the national oncology services.</p>  <p>  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the Oncology day ward services were delivered on half a ward on the third floor of the main hospital building. Following a risk assessment with the onset of the pandemic,  the day ward service was temporarily re-housed in the Palliative Care day ward. This was never envisaged to be a long-term solution and UHK had linked with HSE Estates to plan for a dedicated Oncology Development on-site, incorporating both Oncology day services and OPD. This process is at planning stage and UHK has also collaborated with the local &lsquo;Comfort for Chemo Kerry&rsquo; charity organisation seeking their support and input.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that approval, planning and construction/fitting out of a dedicated unit on the UHK campus will take some time, and it is also acknowledged that the Palliative Care Day Ward service requires access to their unit again.  In these circumstances, UHK has linked with the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee (BSHT), to provide temporary accommodation.  Plans are now at an advanced stage to move the day ward service to a unit on the BSHT campus when it is refurbished. The service will continue to be fully staffed by HSE/UHK personnel at the new location. OPD services will remain at UHK.  Both the National Cancer Control Programme and SSWHG are fully supportive of this plan.</p></reply>

The goal of this amendment is to assist in protecting the viability and sustainability of family farms and family run businesses. </p>  <p>  The Act also introduces changes that cap contributions from the proceeds of sale of a principal residence to be capped at three years in care.

The initiative is gradually being introduced by age cohort, starting with younger women who are least likely to be financially independent and where cost has been shown to be a greater barrier to access contraception.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide for:</p>  <p>  - The cost of prescription contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception and administration of contraceptive injections plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove long-acting reversible contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of a maximum of two consultations per annum with GPs and other doctors to discuss forms of contraception suitable for individual patients and to enable prescription of same.</p>  <p>  - Training and certification of additional GPs to fit long-acting reversible contraception </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that a wide range of contraceptive options, currently available to medical card holders, will be made available through this scheme. This includes contraceptive injections, implants, various types of intrauterine system (IUS) or device (IUD; commonly known as the coil), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill.</p>  <p>  Funding for free contraception in Budget 2022 also includes an allocation for training of additional GPs in fitting and removal of various forms of long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. various forms of the coil and contraceptive implant). It is envisaged that this will commence in 2022.</p>  <p>  In order to give time to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals and ensure the implementation of service delivery arrangements through the appropriate areas of the healthcare system, it is envisaged that the scheme will commence in August 2022, but this is dependent on legislative timelines.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it should be noted that those with a medical card already have access to most forms of contraception at minimal cost (subject only to the prescription charge), while those with a GP visit card are also supported to some extent as the clinical cost element of contraception is reduced. Furthermore, the Drugs Payment Scheme, for which anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is eligible, covers the cost of prescription items, if these exceed the monthly limit, which will be reduced from &euro;114 to &euro;100 through measures included in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  Some access to free contraception is already enabled in some contexts. the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015, functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes. The NCDS currently distributes free condoms through 25 HSE locations, 27 higher education institutions and 44 non-government agencies. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while oral contraception and various forms of long-acting reversible contraception can be more effective at preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs that is not provided by non-barrier forms of contraception. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that continued expansion of the NCDS will be facilitated in line with demand, in order to support the STI prevention and sexual health promotion needs of people living in Ireland</p></reply>

This will happen where a family successor commits to working the farm or business for a period of six years from the date of their appointment.</p>  <p>  The Act also extends the 3-year cap on financial assessment of the value of a principal residence to the proceeds from selling that home while in Fair Deal. Once the changes provided for come into operation, a Fair Deal participant will not experience an increase in their contributions to care after three years due to having sold their family home. This is in line with the core principles of the scheme, and will remove a disincentive to the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;1.049 billion has been allocated for Long Term Residential Care in Budget 2022; an increase on 2021 levels of funding. A further &euro;30m has been provided for in Budget 2022 for new developments which includes additional funding to operationalise the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021. The details of this initiative will be finalised as part of the National Service Plan process.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to establishing a new statutory scheme on the financing and regulation of home support. This scheme is a key enabler to providing more alternatives to nursing home care and wider opportunities for people to live fuller, more independent lives. The scheme will provide for the financing and regulation of home-support services in order to provide equitable access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care needs.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.    </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack. </p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group. Without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients. </p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy. </p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s). </p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for the Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department will continue to engage intensively with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this complex legislation. </p>  <p>  The question of whether provision should be made for the retrospective assignment of parentage in respect of children already born through surrogacy arrangements raises complex legal issues which will require detailed examination. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for parental leave comes under the remit of the Minister of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and that Department has informed my officials that legislative changes in respect of all forms of family leave must be developed in the context of the legal situation concerning parentage, including in relation to surrogacy. My officials have also been informed that some forms of family leave may currently be available to commissioning parents, including parental leave and parent&rsquo;s leave. However, any further queries relating to such leave should be directed to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p>  <p>  Finally, as Minister for Health, I have no role in the matter of the level of legal costs which may be incurred in relation to the undertaking of an individual surrogacy agreement or any court applications arising from such an arrangement. </p></reply>

Ireland proposes to put the CSP at the core of the transition of the agricultural sector to a sustainable  food system.</p><p>The new CAP Strategic Plan is structured around the achievement of three general objectives, as set out in EU legislation, namely:</p> <blockquote> 	-  to foster a smart, competitive, resilient and diversified agricultural sector ensuring long term food security.<br /><br />- to support and strengthen environmental protection, including biodiversity, and climate action, and to contribute to achieving the environmental- and climate-related objectives of the Union, including its commitments under the Paris Agreement;<br /><br />- to strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas. </blockquote>  <p>Due to Ireland&rsquo;s temperate climate and exceptional ability to grow grass at relatively low cost, there is a higher reliance on livestock farming. The dairy and beef production in Ireland is already considered to be a carbon efficient food production system. </p><p>The proposed new National Agri-Environment Scheme, Eco-Scheme, Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme, and Organic Farming Scheme will directly assist in meeting the targets outlined for a climate-neutral food system by 2050, by reducing biogenic methane levels, reducing ammonia emission levels, reducing nutrient losses to water, prioritising biodiversity on farmed area and increasing the area of agricultural land farmed organically.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food system has a global reputation for quality and safety, primarily based on a sustainable grazed grass approach. Global demand for high quality food is increasing in line with increases in global population, urbanization and affluence, and the Irish agri-food sector is well placed to play a role in meeting this demand.</p><p>Agriculture must do its share of the climate ask and absolute emissions from the sector must fall over the years ahead. However, this does not mean that Ireland needs to change from our role as a producer and exporter of safe, high quality and sustainably produced food.</p><p>I recently launched the Food Vision 2030 strategy, which sets out a pathway to Ireland becoming a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade and this will be the basis for the future competitive advantage of the sector. </p><p>By adopting an integrated food systems approach, Ireland will become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems, producing safe, nutritious, and high-value food while protecting and enhancing our natural resources and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities within the national economy.</p><p>With a focus on the marketplace together with a continuing reduction in the carbon-footprint of our produce, I am very confident that we will continue the transition to become even more sustainable, with benefits for water, air quality, biodiversity, our farmers and our consumers.  </p></reply>

This not only represents an income diversification opportunity but also a cost saving measure for Irish farmers.</p><p>The supply of biomass feedstock is an important element for the decarbonisation of heat systems in our agri-food industries and the sector will continue to be a key source of sustainable indigenous biomass material and in fact will double the resource between now and 2030. </p><p>It should be noted that while the on-farm renewable energy generation activities of our farmers contribute in a positive way to the energy system the emission reduction benefits of this activity remains with the energy sector.

It is dominated by livestock with 80% of our agricultural area in grassland producing beef and dairy products that are exported to 180 countries all over the world. </p>  <p>  The sector accounts for 8% of all employment and 10% of all exports that leave Ireland are Ag-food-based. I recently launched our Food Vision 2030 strategy that targets increasing food exports  to &euro;21billion by 2030. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food system has a global reputation for quality and safety, primarily based on a sustainable grazed grass approach. Global demand for high quality food is increasing in line with increases in global population, urbanisation and affluence, and the Irish agri-food sector is well placed to play a role in meeting this demand.</p>  <p>  Agriculture must do its share of the climate ask and absolute emissions from the sector must fall over the years ahead. However, this does not mean that Ireland needs to change from our role as a producer and exporter of safe, high quality and sustainably produced food.</p>  <p>  Food Vision 2030 sets out a pathway to Ireland becoming a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade and this will be the basis for the future competitive advantage of the sector. By adopting an integrated food systems approach, Ireland will become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems, producing safe, nutritious, and high-value food while protecting and enhancing our natural resources and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities within the national economy.</p>  <p>  The long-standing policy of supplying an increasingly diversified range of export markets and developing new high-value markets will continue. As a result, I do not envisage a replacement of Irish products in the marketplace, rather the focus on continuing to reduce the carbon-footprint of our produce. I am very confident that we can transition the sector to be more sustainable, with benefits for water, air quality and biodiversity, while continuing to meet market demands.</p></reply>

Ireland must adopt this systematic approach to ensure a climate smart, environmentally sustainable agri-food sector into the future, to achieve our goal of a climate-neutral agri-food system by 2050. </p>  <p>  AgClimatise, our National Roadmap towards Climate Neutrality for the Agriculture Sector, to be implemented under the Strategy, sets us on a path to developing a climate neutral food system compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature goals by 2050, whereby the climate impact of biogenic methane is reduced to zero and remaining agricultural emissions are balanced by removals through land use and a significant contribution to renewable energy. </p>  <p>  While the national herd has remained relatively stable in recent years, dairy cow numbers are now 49% higher than in 2010, exceeding 1.6 million in 2021 according to the CSO Provisional June livestock survey. An increase in biogenic methane emissions from increasing livestock numbers will compromise the objective of achieving a climate-neutral agri-food sector by 2050. </p>  <p>  Therefore, stabilising the national herd number will be necessary to achieve our emissions reduction targets. It is important to emphasise, however, that stabilising the national herd is just one contributory factor to mitigating Greenhouse Gas and ammonia emissions. </p>  <p>  Under the guidance of FoodVision 2030,  detailed plans will be produced to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector, as well as the beef sector.  Ireland&rsquo;s new CAP Strategic Plan (2023-2027) will provide incentives which underpin the sustainable development of the agri-food sector, providing appropriate supports to primary producers in leading the implementation of environment and climate objectives. </p>  <p>  Amongst these supports, Targeted Agriculture Modernisations Schemes (TAMS) will provide ongoing financial supports, while breeding technologies will play a key role in reducing the carbon footprint of livestock sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, both I and the Department will continue to promote the development of a competitive dairy sector, which facilitates trade in dairy products, and maximises market access opportunities and scope for product and market diversification.</p></reply>

Reductions in production globally and increased demand are expected to support continued strong performance throughout 2021. The current average price is &euro;6.13 per kg, which is 25% above the same period last year. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia analysis suggests that retail demand for sheepmeat increased over the last year, as consumers invested more time in preparing home-cooked meals.  In 2020, according to CSO data, 73% of sheepmeat products in value terms were exported to the EU, 12% to the UK and 15% to other third country markets. The value of sheepmeat exports to international markets increased significantly in  2020, but France remains the single most important export destination, accounting for a third of Irish sheepmeat exports in 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to the future prospects for Irish sheepmeat exports, the fundamentals are strong. According to the CSO, 2020 was a prosperous year for Ireland's overseas sheepmeat trade, with 64,000 tonnes exported to 38 international markets at a value of nearly &euro;356 million. This represents an increase of 12% in value terms on 2019. </p>  <p>  As with other meat commodities, my officials continue to work towards opening new outlets for sheepmeat and enhancing existing access to as many markets as possible for Irish sheepmeat. The Irish food industry is well positioned to gain from the opportunities presented by expanding global demand for high-quality Irish lamb, underpinned by the market development efforts of the Department, Bord Bia, the Irish embassy network, and the food industry. </p>  <p>  I recently signed and exchanged formal protocols with the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) that will pave the way for the export of sheepmeat from Ireland to China. This represents an important milestone in gaining access to the Chinese market. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders on maximising potential opportunities for Irish sheepmeat exports. I will continue to back and support our sheep farmers.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the clear benefits to individuals and families in terms of quality of life indicators, remote working from hubs will also support local economies, reduce carbon emissions and may arrest or reverse the depopulation of certain areas.</p><p>The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of new digital hubs. In April, I announced funding of &euro;81m for 25 landmark projects under the RRDF. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs. Support for new remote working hubs is also one of the areas being prioritised under my Department's 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme. The focus is on establishing new remote working facilities in town and village centres where properties are currently vacant or where existing community/ publicly owned buildings can be repurposed. This call closed to applications on 16 July 2021 and the assessment process is currently underway, with successful projects set to be announced by the end of the year.  </p><p>In May I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. This platform will offer a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. To date the National Hub Network Working Group identified and mapped over 450 remote working hubs throughout the country. Approximately 150 hubs have been on boarded onto the platform, with this number rising each month. The remainder will be invited to join the Connected Hubs Network creating a shared infrastructure that will deliver real benefits across the country.  </p><p>In July this year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded close to &euro;9 million in funding to 118 successful applicants.  This funding  will allow for the expansion of existing hub facilities and remote working infrastructure in digital hubs, including Broadband Connection Points, throughout the country. </p><p>I am happy to confirm that I have secured additional funding as part of Budget 2022 across the range of services provided by my Department, including for the further support of remote working hubs. Details of calls for applications to relevant funding streams will be announced by my Department in due course.  </p></reply>

Roscommon County Council have been informed that a Section 57 Declaration is also required in connection with the works for the My Open Library service. When planning permission is granted, the local authority have advised that they will seek tenders for the appointment of contractors for the overall project. </p><p>It is expected that the works, which will comprise both the improvements under the Small Scale Capital Works Programme and the works necessary for the installation of the My Open Library service, will be completed by the second quarter of 2022. </p><p>In the meantime, the mobile library continues to provide a service in the town every Wednesday and the local authority will continue to monitor demand throughout the duration of the works. </p><p>In September 2020, my Department approved Small Scale Capital Works Programme funding of &euro;40,000 for Roscommon County Council to support the upgrade of windows and flooring in the Strokestown Library.  The plans also include a number of changes to the library layout along with the installation of new shelving and furniture, which will create more usable space in the main library and allow for significant expansion of the children&rsquo;s library space.</p><p>The works on the Strokestown Library are now completed and Roscommon County Council are currently at fit-out stage.  I understand that issues have arisen with the manufacturing and delivery of the shelving and furniture which has resulted in a delay in the completion of the project, but these are now scheduled for delivery in early November 2021. As a result, the  library is scheduled for reopening by the end of November 2021. </p><p>Similar to Ballaghaderreen, the mobile library continues to provide a service in Strokestown every second Thursday and the local authority will continue to monitor demand throughout the duration of the works.</p></reply>
