Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the grounds for terminations set out in the table to that section.</p>  <p>  The so-called &lsquo;Tyrrelstown amendment', included in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, provides a proportionate and justifiable limit to the legal right of landlords to use the 'intention to sell' ground to terminate a tenancy.  Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2018 published last December aims to deliver on a number of commitments flowing from Rebuilding Ireland and commitments I made to provide the RTB with additional powers and resources to deliver enhanced protections to both tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  While extending the scope of the "Tyrrelstown amendment" is legally problematical and is therefore not provided for in the Bill, the Government has approved a range of amendments, including provisions to strengthen further the arrangements in relation to security of tenure for tenants and enforcement mechanisms under the Acts.  These amendments will be introduced at Dail Committee Stage of the Bill which is scheduled to be taken later this week.  Thereafter, the Government will be working to ensure that the Bill completes its passage through both Houses as quickly as possible, supporting the stability of the private rental sector in the interests of tenants and landlords alike.  </p></reply>

On 2 April 2019, the Government approved proposals I brought forward for significant  Committee Stage amendments to the Bill, including a provision that the operation of existing Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) will now extend to 31 December 2021, supporting the continued restrictions on rent increases in the areas concerned.  </p>  <p>  The key measures and reforms in the Bill are designed to enhance the enforcement powers and data capacity for the RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) arrangements.  Specifically in relation to RPZs, the Bill provides powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who fail to comply with the 4% rent increase restriction and the exemptions from the 4% restriction will be revised so as to apply only to the first rent setting, rather than every rent setting, of a new rental property.  In addition, revisions are being proposed to give wider scope to the application of Rent Pressure Zones. </p>  <p>  A fundamental principle of the Bill is to secure stability and confidence in the rental sector and its economic viability, and to safeguard and balance the rights of both tenants and landlords, while enhancing the effectiveness of the Residential Tenancies Acts as a whole.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill is scheduled for D&aacute;il Committee stage debate later this week and I look forward to constructive discussions with the Deputy and other members of the Committee in that context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900059#WRA03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 101 and 111 together.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 340,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), of which approximately 310,000 are private rented tenancies. The majority of landlords, just over 70%, own just one property, with a further 16% owning just two properties. Almost 86% of the registered rental housing stock is owned by landlords with less than 10 properties, reflecting the fact that the overall proportion of the rental stock held by institutional investors is relatively low. </p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing rented residential property on a larger scale, provides additional stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility. Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles. The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment, provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of the supply of housing, not least given the scale of housing development envisaged under the National Planning Framework over the period to 2040, particularly apartment developments in the main urban centres.  It is worth noting that a recent report on institutional investment from the Department of Finance clearly points to the benefits of professionalising the sector, realising economies of scale, and a resultant improvement in regulatory and taxation compliance standards.  </p>  <p>  That report also notes that it would not be correct to assume that the properties being bought by institutional investors would otherwise have been bought by first time buyers, with the suggestion being made that much of the stock would likely have been purchased by Buy to Let investors with access to equity, either through their household or business wealth.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to improving security of tenure of tenants and I have brought forward additional measures in this regard for Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, scheduled for later this week.  These include providing new powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the rent increase restrictions in Rental Pressure Zones, which are the areas where institutional investment tends to be concentrated.</p>  <p>  The legislation will allow the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made. It will also require the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB and significantly extend the notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords. The annual registration of tenancies will provide improved data on the profile of landlords in the market, including institutional landlords, and will be of benefit to my Department in keeping the market under review, ensuring that we facilitate the positive impacts of institutional investment, while addressing any broader issues that may arise. </p></reply>

For this reason, my Department referred the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work being undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes, supported by grant funding from my Department.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for both parties to progress these engagements, which I hope can lead to a workable, mutually acceptable approach to moving forward on this issue.  </p></reply>

In addition, 380 cost rental homes will be delivered between projects at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown.   </p></reply>

In addition, my Department is funding social housing delivery through acquisitions, leasing arrangements, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). Such a blend of delivery mechanisms is essential to ensure the needs of households will be successfully met.</p>  <p>  The social housing delivery output figures for 2018 show that the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is working.  The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22% between September 2016 and June 2018, from 91,600 households to 71,858. Through partnerships between local authorities, AHBs and a range of other delivery partners, over 45,000 individuals and families had their housing needs met during 2016 and 2017.  A total of 27,103 households had their housing needs met in 2018, with 8,422 new homes brought into the active social housing stock through, build, acquisition, voids and leasing programmes.  This is 550 more homes than targeted for the year.</p>  <p>  My Department engages with all local authorities, including with Dublin City Council, on a regular basis regarding the accelerated delivery of social housing. This includes at Chief Executive level, bilaterals at senior official level and quarterly technical meetings. In terms of the progress made in social housing delivery in 2018 and in the context of the social housing target setting process for 2019, my Department has had significant engagement and contacts with officials in Dublin City Council. Indeed, I have, myself, engaged with the Chief Executive of Dublin City Council on many occasions in relation to social housing delivery and my most recent engagement with the Chief Executive was at the last Housing Summit, which I hosted in February this year.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the actions, targets, legislative framework and resources available to all local authorities under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector and I will be continuing to work with all stakeholders to ensure that delivery remains on target.</p></reply>

This fell to 85,799 in June 2017, and the most recent assessment in 2018 shows that 71,858 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 19,7421 households or 22% over the period 2016 to 2018.</p><p>The targets for social housing provision set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness were developed to provide immediate, medium and long-term supports for households on local authority waiting lists. The Plan aims to deliver more than 50,000 built, acquired and leased homes over the 6 year period of the Plan. This ambition has been proportionately divided into local authority targets, directly reflecting the numbers on individual local authority lists. In addition, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) will continue to deliver flexible and immediate housing solutions to complement the build, acquisition and leasing programmes. Overall, more than 138,000 housing supports are anticipated over the lifetime of the Plan. This makes provision for the 91,600 households on the lists at the time the Plan was published and also anticipated additional need arising.</p><p>All available resources at national and local level have been mobilised to maximise the delivery of social housing as quickly and efficiently as possible.Local authority build programmes are an essential component of the 50,000 homes to be delivered over the lifetime of the Plan. In addition to local authorities building on their own land, this also includes partnerships with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Annual delivery targets are issued to local authorities and delivery against these targets is published quarterly on my Department's website. The 2019 Social Housing targets are available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>My Department works closely with each individual local authority to provide the necessary funding and structures to enable them to deliver their minimum build targets, and where possible to exceed their targets and advance their pipelines for additional delivery in the coming years.  Quarterly Construction Status Reports provide an overview of new build social housing completed and being advanced across the 31 local authorities.  The latest report, reflecting the position at the end of 2018, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website, at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The National Student Accommodation Strategy was subsequently launched in July 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Recent analysis from the Higher Education Authority has indicated that, by September 2018, over 5,500 bed-spaces had been delivered since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland. Some 4,800 additional bed-spaces are currently under construction nationally, with over 7,900 further bed-spaces having received planning permission and are yet to commence construction. These figures indicate that the National Student Accommodation Strategy's Private Build Student Accommodation (PBSA) construction targets will be met, and indeed surpassed, and that significant progress is being made in the provision of newly constructed accommodation for this distinct segment of housing demand.  The increase in new student accommodation, as detailed above, is contributing to the increase in the overall stock of residential accommodation nationally and easing pressures in the broader rental sector, which benefits all students seeking rental accommodation,  regardless of country of origin.</p></reply>

In addition to local authorities building on their own land, this also includes partnerships with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Annual targets for build, acquisition, leasing, HAP and RAS are issued to local authorities, and delivery against these targets is published quarterly on the Department's website. The 2019 social housing targets are available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>My Department supports delivery through the development and implementation of policy and legislation geared towards enhanced supply and also through the provision of significant funding for local authorities. In addition, my Department works closely with each individual local authority to support them to deliver their minimum build targets, and where possible to exceed their targets and advance their pipelines for additional delivery in the coming years. The Social Housing Construction Status Reports which I publish on a quarterly basis provide an overview of all new build social housing completed and being advanced across the 31 local authorities. The latest report, which sets out the position at end 2018, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>To further support local authorities and AHBs deliver, my Department has streamlined its approval processes and provided a range of delivery supports to local authorities. In order to deliver effectively and efficiently, local authorities and approved housing bodies are responding using a combination of the rapid build framework, turnkey opportunities, as well as through traditional construction methods. </p><p>Over the coming three years, social housing output will continue to increase further throughout the country.  I am confident that delivery remains on track to meet our target to provide 50,000 new social housing homes over the 2016 - 2021 period.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.100.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900060#WRB06600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 115 together.</p>  <p>  The Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is designed to increase the delivery of housing across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  The Action Plan focuses, in particular, on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes in the period to 2021, while also making the best use of existing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant housing sector.  </p>  <p>  Many of the measures set out in Rebuilding Ireland are in line with the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in 2016, including actions to provide assistance to those at risk of becoming homeless, through accelerated delivery of social housing and through increased protections for both tenants and landlords within the rental sector. These measures aim to support people remain in their own homes where possible. </p>  <p>  One of the measures that has been introduced is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, known as Abhaile, which is provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme, introduced in 2012 and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department, is targeted at those households in arrears whose mortgage is unsustainable and who are eligible for social housing support. Under the scheme an eligible household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  The borrower voluntarily surrenders their property to their lender who in turn sells the property to an AHB.  The AHB becomes the landlord and the household can remain in the family home as a social housing tenant.  The tenant pays a differential rent to the AHB, based on their income, which is designed to be affordable.  The MTR scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  </p>  <p>  I am also committed to strengthening and improving security of tenure for tenants.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2018 was published in December 2018.  The key focus of the Bill is to deliver on a number of commitments flowing from Rebuilding Ireland and the commitments made in September 2017 to provide the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with additional powers and resources to deliver enhanced protections to both tenants and landlords.  The key measures and reforms are designed to enhance enforcement powers for the RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) arrangements, along with some further targeted priority measures.  Government has also approved further amendments to the Bill, to be introduced at committee stage to extend the duration of Rent Pressure Zone restrictions to the end of 2021, and to restrict the exemption for new properties to the market to the first letting, which is to be at market rent level.  Any subsequent rent review will be restricted to a maximum 4% rent increase.  Also to be introduced at Committee stage are measures to protect tenants where a notice to quit is made under Section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also fully committed to supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  Budget 2019 provided an allocation of &euro;146m, an increase of over 25% on the 2018 allocation, for the provision of homeless services by the local authorities. This funding will ensure that the local authorities can provide the best possible supports to those individuals and families experiencing homelessness, until they can be assisted to secure a more sustainable housing solution to their needs. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies, an increase of over 8% on 2017.   I and my Department will remain resolutely focused on making the further progress required to address the challenges in relation to homelessness.</p></reply>

Any alteration of approved planning schemes will require the undertaking of a review process that is provided for in statute.  </p><p>In this regard, the guidelines seek to ensure that, on the one hand, planning authorities give practical effect to Government policy on building height in planning scheme areas, while at the same time allowing for effective public engagement in any significant policy shift in relation to heights to comply with Government policy and in view of the absence of third party appeal rights in relation to planning applications in SDZs.</p><p>Regarding their wider application, the guidelines set out a series of practical considerations, including in relation to daylight, that planning authorities must take into account in assessing relevant development proposals.  </p><p>In determining planning policy and making planning decisions around appropriate building heights, the planning process has to strike a careful balance between enabling strategic long-term sustainable development, while ensuring the highest standards of urban design, architectural quality and place-making outcomes.  I am satisfied that the guidelines concerned are necessary and appropriate to give clear context and direction to the overall requirement to promote increased density and building height in appropriate locations within our urban centres. </p></reply>

However, it was also agreed that my Department would continue to provide funding support for the local authorities&rsquo; work in returning vacant properties to use, over and above the numbers reflected in Rebuilding Ireland targets. Therefore, while the Rebuilding Ireland delivery statistics show that the voids target of 560 homes for 2018 was met, a significant programme of voids refurbishment beyond the targeted level was also funded. The total number of voids brought back to productive use which were funded by my Department in 2018 was 1,765, which is comparable to the level of activity in 2017.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, responsive repairs and implementing planned maintenance programmes, will continue to be matters for each individual local authority, in line with Section 58 of the Housing Act 1966.  I believe the best way in which improvements can be made in this area is for local authorities to have a common approach to this work, based on established best practice. I am pleased, therefore, that a group representing a number of local authorities is working to identify best practice in relation to housing stock maintenance and repairs, within the structure of the City and County Management Association (CCMA).</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review, on behalf of my Department. </p><p>The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The reform agenda includes:</p><p>- Amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction IndustryRegister Ireland) Bill.</p><p>In relation to legacy issues, I and my predecessors have supported homeowners and addressed a number of the defects that have come to light over the last decade, including through - </p><p>- the independent Report of the Pyrite Panel and the Pyrite Remediation Scheme; </p><p>- the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks; and</p><p>- the publication of a Framework for enhancing Fire Safety in dwellings where concerns arise. </p><p>I acknowledge the very stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when defects occur in their homes.However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. </p><p>While the Committee&rsquo;s report recommends a redress scheme,  it is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues. Nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.</p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and  a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following .</p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following .</p><p>In addition, in relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review Part B &ndash; Fire Safety and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwellings/(houses) only.  A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, which includes apartments, is being prepared for public consultation.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders.  The standardised protocol was published by the NSAI on 13 November 2018 and &lsquo;I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;, is available at .</p><p>The standard can be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks, in order to decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.  The standard:</p><p>1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of  deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite); </p><p>2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem; </p><p>3. describes the scope of any testing required; and</p><p>4. categorises buildings, in  accordance with the standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference. Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they are in the process of finalising measures to establish such a register now that the standardised protocol is in place. Engineers Ireland have issued a call for suitably qualified engineers to participate on the register.  They have recently announced that training will be provided in May for those engineers with the aim of ensuring consistency throughout the industry in assessing and categorising the damage. </p><p>In 2017, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. I made similar visits to both counties last year and I will continue to monitor the situation and to update affected parties on progress. </p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  Work on the development of such a scheme is well underway, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the operation and funding of the scheme.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme shortly, with a view to publishing details of the scheme thereafter.</p></reply>

The working group comprises senior officials from the Planning Division of my Department and senior officials from the Planning Divisions of local authorities, nominated by the local government sector. </p>  <p>  The objective is to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives contained in local authority development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  Planning authorities were advised in May 2017 by way of Circular Letter PL 02/2017, that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place, pending the issuing of the revised guidelines. The Circular also advised that they should not amend the rural housing local needs policies in their development plans until the revised Guidelines have issued.  </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) also provides an important context for the finalisation of the revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines. National Policy Objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development, in order to avoid over-development of those areas. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, National Policy Objective 37 of the NPF requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Need Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the 2000 Act. This will assist local authorities in ensuring long-term strategic housing needs are met across all types, tenures and locations across their functional areas, both urban and rural. Accordingly, the NPF objectives are aligned with the approach already expected of planning authorities under the current 2005 Guidelines.  My Department intends to provide further guidance to local authorities later this year, to support their HNDA work as part of the review of their Development Plans. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the engagement with the European Commission regarding revisions to the 2005 Guidelines and subject to the completion of the ongoing deliberations by the working group, I will be in a position to finalise and issue to planning authorities revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines that take account of the relevant European Court of Justice judgment. </p></reply>

The Government is committed to doing all it can to help minimise commercial vacancy in cities, towns and villages using all available mechanisms. In this regard, while my Department is not the lead Department in terms of commercial enterprise, it does have policy responsibility for a number of areas that it is bringing to bear on this issue, such as through planning policy, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, building standards, and commercial rates. Local authorities also work closely on the ground with business and communities on this issue.  </p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) is an important element of Project Ireland 2040. It comprises an allocation of &euro;2 billion from the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2027, with &euro;58 million available for expenditure in 2019 and an overall Exchequer allocation of &euro;550 million earmarked for the Fund up to the end of 2022. The URDF, targets the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns. URDF support of &euro;8.2m have been approved in principle, for projects in Sligo and Leitrim.  </p><p>In terms of commercial rates, legislative provision is made for the refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances such as, for example, if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>Some local authorities have introduced locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 that provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  No Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p><p>The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, which contains proposals for modernisation of the legislation governing commercial rates and provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties, is currently before the Oireachtas. </p><p>Finally, my Department has made legislative amendments in support of the reactivation of vacant properties. New exempted development Regulations came into operation last year, allowing for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission.  </p><p>This week sees the formal launch of the new Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings, the contents of which have been informed by a representative working group, established and chaired by my Department. The manual provides property owners, local authorities and those involved in the construction industry with clear and detailed guidance on current policy and regulatory requirements that apply to vacant &ldquo;over the shop&rdquo; type development.  The manual is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s Investment Plan, based on an identified need against set criteria. </p><p>Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of its submissions to the CRU on its detailed investment plans.  These submissions are currently being considered by the CRU and a decision is expected in the second half of 2019.  </p><p>The broad approach outlined in the document &ldquo;Water Services Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rdquo; which I published last year in draft format under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), is to ensure that there is effective coordination between planning authorities in their planning functions, Irish Water in its rolling capital investment programmes and local community interests.The draft Guidelines highlight that it is the policy of Irish Water to facilitate connections to existing infrastructure, where capacity exists, in order to maximise the use of existing infrastructure and reduce additional investment costs; and that there is a general presumption that development will be focused into areas that are serviced by public water supply and wastewater collection networks with the exception of domestic systems for single dwellings.  I propose to issue final Guidelines shortly. </p></reply>

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and the other at Emmet Road in Inchicore. </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council (DLRCC) and two Approved Housing Bodies (Respond and T&uacute;ath) are working on the project at Enniskerry Road, which will deliver 50 cost rental homes and 105 social housing homes.  This project is providing very valuable lessons and is helping to shape the model and specifications for future larger-scale projects.  Tenders for the project have been assessed and contractors are expected to be on site later in Q2 2019.  An application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund last year in relation to the project was successful and some &euro;4m in grant assistance will be provided.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Emmet Road site, while this project is at an earlier stage of development, it is envisaged that the final tenure-mix, which will be decided by Dublin City Council, will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided under cost rental arrangements. The City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a team to drive the project forward and an Urban Design Development Framework Plan will be prepared.  The European Investment Bank (EIB) is also providing financial and advisory services on this project.   </p>  <p>  Shanganagh Castle is an excellent site and DLRCC is continuing to engage with all relevant parties to progress the development of this site, including with my Department, the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA). I am advised that the Integrated Design Team is making good progress on developing a Masterplan, including an Infrastructural Masterplan for the site.  DLRCC is also engaging with the Land Development Agency (LDA) to explore options for the affordable element, with the intention to submit a formal application to my Department under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The exact mix of housing, however, is ultimately a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing very competitive EIB financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes.  I expect that the cost rental schemes should be able to deliver rents of between of 10% to 25% below the market rate. </p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, my Department has been working closely with all local authorities, including local authorities in the GDA, to ensure that new social and affordable homes can be delivered from the public land bank, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>In terms of the strategic development of the State&rsquo;s residential land bank, all local authority sites have been mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland land map. The map includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites amounting to some 1,700 hectares including the land owned by local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area and is available at the following link: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>All local authorities are being funded to significantly increase their delivery of social housing, as part of the Rebuilding Ireland programme, and a strong social housing construction pipeline is already in place for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. A detailed breakdown of the social housing construction programme for all local authorities is set out in the Social Housing Construction Status Report, which is published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 4 of 2018 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Further projects will continue to be added to the programme on an ongoing basis.</p><p>In terms of affordable housing, a targeted approach is being pursued to support local authorities.  Significant housing delivery is to be achieved through the Serviced Site Fund (SSF), where &euro;310 million has been allocated to support the delivery of at least 6,200 affordable homes over the next three years.  An initial 8 projects across the GDA, listed in the table below, were among 10 projects, with the potential for 1,400 affordable homes, which have been approved for &euro;43 million of funding under the first call for proposals. The first homes are expected to be delivered next year. A second call for proposals under the SSF has now also issued. </p><p><b>Table: </b>List of projects in the GDA that have received approval in principle under the SSF first call for proposals.<table><tr><th>LA</th><th>Project Description</th><th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal - &euro; </th><th>Provisional Exchequer Grant Amount - &euro; </th><th>Provisional LA Contribution - &euro;</th><th>Affordable Housing Potential </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Cherry Orchard</td><td>&euro;7,645,415</td><td>&euro;6,804,419</td><td>&euro;840,996</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Balbutcher, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;4,135,351</td><td>&euro;3,680,462</td><td>&euro;454,889</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Sillogue, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;3,975,000</td><td>&euro;3,537,750</td><td>&euro;437,250</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>Enniskerry Road</td><td>&euro;4,537,576</td><td>&euro;4,038,443</td><td>&euro;499,133</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Church Fields, Mulhuddart</td><td>&euro;11,000,000</td><td>&euro;9,790,000</td><td>&euro;1,210,000</td><td>753</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Dun Emer, Lusk</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Hackettstown, Skerries</td><td>&euro;2,198,667</td><td>&euro;1,956,814</td><td>&euro;241,853</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;34,992,009</td><td>&euro;31,142,888</td><td>&euro;3,849,121</td><td>1,266</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department will continue to engage proactively with the local authorities to accelerate the delivery of these projects.  The combination of this Fund and the significantly increased funding for the social housing programme will open up more opportunities for larger mixed-tenure developments on key sites such as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin.</p><p>Acknowledging that renters in Dublin are currently facing significant access and affordability challenges, the Government is also committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Cost Rental is a model of delivery where the provider supplies accommodation and charges rents sufficient to cover both the cost of provision and ongoing operational expenses.  Two pathfinder pilot projects in the former St. Michael's Estate Inchicore and Enniskerry Road will deliver 380 cost rental homes and the experience gained from these projects will inform a national approach to cost rental and its delivery at scale. </p></reply>

Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  There are twenty-seven (27) Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles (LTAV) available to the Defence Forces.  Since delivery in 2010, the LTAV fleet has been used extensively on deployment both overseas and on island for training purposes.  No LTAVs were purchased in the years 2017, 2018 or 2019 to date and no LTAVs were withdrawn during this period.</p>  <p>  The LTAV fleet complements the Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and other armoured vehicles in the conduct of conventional and Peace Support Operations. A multi-year mid-life upgrade programme for the APC fleet is under way, which will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. The first twenty (20) upgraded vehicles were recently delivered.</p>  <p>  In addition, there has been further investment in the armoured fleet with the acquisition of 24 Armoured Utility Vehicles in 2017, and more recently the acquisition of 10 Combat Support Service Armoured 8 x 8 Drops Vehicles which were delivered in late 2018. These vehicles along with the fleet of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles will provide personnel with the requisite force protection to operate in a supporting role in high-threat environments.  The procurement of these vehicles will also enhance Ireland's ability to participate in integrated multinational deployments.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

My itinerary also included briefings from the Chief of Staff of UNDOF, who at that time was Ireland's Colonel Mick Dawson.</p>  <p>  Since then, the Irish Contingent has moved back to Camp Faouar, where the Headquarters of UNDOF is also located.  A visit to Camp Faouar to visit Irish Troops would be difficult at this time given the ongoing conflict in Syria, which would be the access point for any visit to Camp Faouar and the political situation which pertains there.  However, this will be kept under review as the situation in Syria continues to evolve.</p></reply>

Ireland takes these reports very seriously and has raised our concerns with our Chinese counterparts, in bilateral and multilateral contexts, and as an EU Member State.</p>  <p>  The subject was raised with China's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Wang Chao, during political consultations held with China last November. Our concerns about the situation in Xinjiang are also raised in our contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing.</p>  <p>  Ireland participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which was also held in November.  In addition to expressing concern at reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs, in particular their detention in political re-education camps, we urged China to respect freedom of religion and belief and recommended that China grant access to the OHCHR to all regions of the country including Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The EU also continues to raise concerns regarding freedom of religion and belief at bilateral and multilateral levels. The most recent EU-China Human Rights Dialogue was held just last week, on the 1-2 April, where the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, such measures must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms and international laws. The EU raised the system of political re-education camps and called on China to allow meaningful, unsupervised and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Procedures.</p>  <p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March, the EU similarly raised concerns about the existence of political re-education camps and widespread surveillance and restrictions particularly targeted at Uighurs in Xinjiang, and again urged China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland fully supports the EU position, and actively contributes to its actions and statements.</p></reply>

As well as going against the 2012 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, these punishments may also breach Brunei's obligations as a party to the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provisions referred to by the Deputy, Ireland is committed to promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI+) individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systemic discrimination in many countries. In both our bilateral and multilateral engagement on human rights, we focus on ensuring individuals&rsquo; human rights and non-discrimination, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>  <p>  Irish Consulates and Embassies overseas cooperate closely with EU delegations and Embassies of the other EU Member States to advocate for the rights of LGBTI+ persons, including advocating for the decriminalisation of homosexuality where it exists and against its criminalisation where this is contemplated.  Our diplomatic network also actively supports LGBTI+ rights by participating in Gay Pride parades and similar events across the world and offering support to LGBTI+ civil society organisations.</p>  <p>  Ireland also raises the rights of LGBTI+ individuals at international level through our work at the United Nations and the European Union as well as our engagement in regional organisations such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland reaffirms its strong and unequivocal opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances and for all cases. Ireland expects Brunei-Darussalam to maintain its de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva we will take the opportunity of the upcoming Universal Periodic Review of Brunei-Darussalam next month to call on the Government to abide by its international and regional human rights commitments and obligations.</p></reply>

A return of fully functioning devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is urgently needed in order to represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland resulting from the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North-South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North-South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to work with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties to get the necessary political process under way to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  The continuing absence of vital institutions of the Agreement is a source of deep concern for the Government, as it is for the British Government.  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Bradley and I met with the leaders of the five main political parties at Stormont on 15 February, further to our respective consultations with each of the party leaders in January.  This meeting sought the parties&rsquo; views at this stage on how a new talks process could most constructively be commenced in the period ahead. Each of the party leaders confirmed their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on the necessary basis for an effective talks process.</p>  <p>  It was agreed that the two Governments would engage further with the parties to seek an urgent way forward with a new political process that can secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly.</p>  <p>  Following these further consultations, the Government does not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution, but continues to believe that this can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to commence.</p>  <p>  The two-year absence of the devolved institutions cannot be allowed to continue. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly, and NSMC.</p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last year, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  On 21 March, the Secretary of State announced that the period suspending the duty to call an Assembly election would be extended until 25 August. It is imperative therefore that the period ahead is used to get a new political process in place to get all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement up and working again.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.209.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900062#WRD03600"><p>In June 2018, the European Council reconfirmed that a functioning EU policy on migration requires a comprehensive approach which combines effective controls of the EU's external borders, action to strengthen co-operation with countries of transit and origin, and dealing with the management of migrants within the European Union, where a balance of solidarity and responsibility is needed.</p>  <p>  I continue to be deeply troubled by the human rights abuses that migrants and refugees suffer in Libya, in particular the persistent abuses that have been reported in detention centres.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2018, the EU committed to continue to work with the Libyan authorities to improve conditions for migrants and refugees, with a view to addressing the current system of detention.  The EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, met with the Prime Minister of Libya and the UN Special Representative for Libya in February 2019 and discussed how conditions in detention centres can continue to be improved for migrants with the assistance of the EU and UN agencies.</p>  <p>  Over the past 18 months, some progress has been made in alleviating the plight of migrants in Libya. In late 2017, the EU stepped up cooperation with UN agencies and the African Union to accelerate returns from Libya for those migrants who wish to leave, and to establish safe and legal pathways to resettle those who need international protection. This has contributed to the voluntary return of more than 37,000 vulnerable migrants stranded in Libya. The EU also provides support to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, including with primary medical assistance.</p>  <p>  Over 500 asylum-seekers and refugees have been released from detention so far in 2019, but some 6,000 remain, and continued efforts are required on their behalf.  The Libyan authorities should continue to work with relevant international organisations to make available alternatives to detention centres, particularly for vulnerable migrants.  In the meantime, oversight in detention centres needs to be expanded and improved. We are aware that the Libyan Government does not have full control over the territory of Libya, but all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, have a responsibility to end ill treatment of migrants, and to facilitate UN and other humanitarian access to detention centres.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to influence the situation on the ground. There is a governance vacuum in many areas of the country, and in many areas access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted.  Bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning and unified Government.</p>  <p>  While Libya is the epicentre of this crisis, a long-term solution will require further cooperation from States all along migration routes, and the support of regional partners and the international community.  Ireland has committed &euro;15 million to the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa, which aims to address the root causes of destabilisation, forced displacement and irregular migration in Africa. Work to reduce poverty in countries of origin, which is one of the main drivers of irregular migratory flows, is at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.</p></reply>

We will continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress &ndash; both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens; and in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented in order to regularise their status.</p>  <p>  Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has worked closely on these issues with my Department, and with Ireland's Ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall, and his team at the Embassy in Washington, DC, in particular, since his appointment.</p>  <p>  Building on this work, I visited the US in early February for a series of engagements with the US Administration and Congressional leaders on the full range of issues of mutual interest.  I raised immigration issues in these meetings, as I have done in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders since taking office.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Taoiseach had a range of engagements at the highest levels of the US Administration and with Congressional leaders over the St Patrick's Day period.  Eight other Government Ministers were also in the US over St Patrick's Day for one of our most ambitious ever programmes of engagement. They, too, were fully seized of the importance of securing relief for the undocumented Irish and raised the issue, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Following on from these many engagements over St. Patrick's Day, officials in my Department, including those in our Embassy in Washington, D.C., are following up with the contacts made and will reengage with US officials on issues of concern, such as the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  In addition to this work, my Department, including through our Embassy and Consulates in the US, consistently works alongside the Irish Immigration Centres across the US to provide support to those Irish who are undocumented on an ongoing basis. Each Irish Centre receives significant Government funding through the Emigrant Support Programme each year for its work, including support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented.  In 2018, over &euro;3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish Centers.</p></reply>

We are working closely with the Commission on how to mitigate the negative impact on our trade and economy, and to ensure connectivity with the rest of the EU's Single Market, including via the landbridge.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, discussions have had an additional focus on how to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border in the case of no deal, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.  Ireland and the EU are at one in our determination to do all we can, deal or no deal, to avoid a hard border and to protect the peace process.</p>  <p>  If the UK decides to leave without the Withdrawal Agreement, initial, temporary arrangements will be required. Such arrangements will be suboptimal compared to the backstop, and, while we are absolutely determined to avoid physical infrastructure at the border, it would be difficult to avoid serious disruption to the functioning of the all-island economy. There are no easy answers.  The seamless trade we enjoy today would not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for businesses in Northern Ireland will be lost, at least in the short term.</p>  <p>  For any sustainable long-term solution, discussions between the EU, Ireland and the UK will be required, not least given the UK's obligations under the Good Friday Agreement as a co-guarantor of that agreement.  For such a solution, it would be impossible to escape the need for close alignment with the Single Market and Customs Union, and the backstop would be the starting point for these discussions.</p>  <p>  This is also why the Withdrawal Agreement is of such importance. It represents the only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal, and we continue to work as a priority to support its ratification.</p></reply>

The Ombudsman provides an independent, fair, impartial, confidential and free service to resolve complaints through either informal mediation or formal investigation and adjudication.</p>  <p>  When a consumer is unable to resolve a complaint or dispute with a financial service or pension provider, they can refer their complaint to the FSPO. The FSPO deals with complaints informally at first, by listening to both parties and engaging with them to facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to both parties.  Where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute, the FSPO formally investigates the complaint and issues a decision that is legally binding on both parties, subject only to an appeal to the High Court.</p>  <p>  During the formal investigation of complaints, documentary and audio evidence, and other material, together with submissions from the parties, are gathered by the Office and exchanged between the parties.  Following detailed consideration of all of the evidence and submissions made, a preliminary decision is issued to the parties and they are advised that certain limited further submissions can be made prior to the issuing of a legally binding decision.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman's aim is to resolve all complaints as effectively as possible.  While many complaints can be resolved quite quickly through the informal processes which rely heavily on mediation techniques, it can take considerably longer to resolve complaints where a full investigation and adjudication is required. For those complaints which are resolved through the more formal process, the timeframe is determined by the number of submissions received from the parties as all the evidence must be gathered and exchanged in accordance with fair procedures before the issues are considered and a preliminary decision and subsequently a legally binding decision is issued to both parties. In addition, the adjudication of a complaint will sometimes require an oral hearing where evidence is taken under oath.</p>  <p>  Section 62 of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 provides the FSPO with the power to publish legally binding decisions in relation to complaints concerning financial service providers. The legislation provides that decisions should be published in a manner that ensures that a complainant is not identified by name, address or otherwise and a provider is not identified by name or address.</p></reply>

These charges shall be appropriate and in line with the payment service provider&rsquo;s actual costs.</p><p>- provide information on all charges applicable before a user uses a payment service.</p><p>The Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) contains a number of provisions relating to charges which regulated entities including credit institutions must comply with, except when providing a payment service and/or issuing electronic money. Under the Code regulated entities must:  </p><p>- make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer. </p><p>- provide consumers with a breakdown of all charges, including third party charges prior to providing a product or service to the consumer.  Where such charges cannot be ascertained in advance, notify the consumer that such charges will be levied as part of the transaction. </p><p>- display a schedule of fees and charges in public offices, in a manner that is easily accessible to consumers. If the regulated entity has a website, its schedule of fees and charges must also be made available on the website.  </p><p>- notify affected consumers of increases in charges, specifying the new charge and the old charge, or the introduction of any new charge, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect.  </p><p>- where charges are accumulated and applied periodically to accounts and amount to &euro;10 or more, notify the consumer at least 10 business days in advance of the deduction of the charges and give each consumer a breakdown of such charges.</p><p>I can see how the premise of the question could operate for a cash withdrawal from the specific bank's ATM when the transaction is taking place.

Nor am I clear on how it would operate when another ATM network is being used or in the case of an internet transaction on a third party website.</p><p>I am satisfied that consumers are in a position to inform themselves of the charges that they are likely to incur but there is always room for greater transparency.

The proposed rate on exchanges of shares was 0.1% and the proposed rate for derivative transactions was 0.01%.   </p>  <p>  Since it was first mooted, Ireland has had concerns in relation to the FTT proposals, which are widely shared amongst other Member States, including some of the countries participating in enhanced cooperation. In line with those concerns, I continue to believe that the tax only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift toward those financial centres which are not covered by it.</p>  <p>  If however Ireland were to participate in an EU wide FTT, this would necessitate the abolition of our current tax, a stamp duty, on financial transactions. I am advised by Revenue that the yield from the Irish stamp duty of 1% on transactions in shares, stocks and marketable securities was &euro;420.7m in 2018 and &euro;425.3m in 2017.  Instruments used in the financial services industry such as derivatives are generally exempt from stamp duty, unless they relate to immovable property in Ireland or shares in Irish registered companies.  </p>  <p>  The FTT proposal is still being discussed by Eurogroup Finance Ministers and by the ten Member States involved in the enhanced cooperation process, which formed following the failure of the 2011 proposals to gain sufficient support. As I have already noted, Ireland, which is not one of the ten, has not changed its position. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, we are not inclined to stand in the way of any other EU Member States that may wish to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to accurately estimate from data held by Revenue or my Department the yield of an FTT modelled on the proposed EU one, i.e. a tax of 0.1% on share and bond transactions and 0.01% on derivative products. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am informed by my Department that the FTT has not been formally tabled in the discussions on the EU Budget&rsquo;s Own Resources to date.</p></reply>

In addition, the Revenue Pensions Manual gives general guidance on, among other things, how this legislation is to be applied. </p>  <p>  Revenue rules in relation to &ldquo;Increases of Pensions in Payment&rdquo; are set out in Chapter 6.8 of the Revenue Pensions Manual.  Guaranteed increases of a pension in payment may be made by using either of the following formulae-</p>  <p>  - a fixed increase of not more than 3% per annum compound, or </p>  <p>  - an increase linked to the Consumer Price Index, or another similar agreed index.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these rules is to maintain the real value of pension payments and consequently these rules allow for the real value of pensions in payment to be maintained over the course of a pensioner&rsquo;s lifetime. The rules in question have been in existence for over 30 years.</p>  <p>  In 2018 reports emerged to the effect that some pension providers are not &ldquo;paying out&rdquo; on what are known as 5pc escalators (that is, a fixed yearly increase of 5% in the amount of pension payments) in cases where the increase had been paid for at the time the pension was purchased. </p>  <p>  I am informed that Revenue has made enquiries into this matter and can confirm there are 1,080 such policies in existence of which 160 policies are currently being restricted and additional policies may be restricted in future. Revenue is engaging with the insurance industry in relation to this matter and will meet the representative body, Insurance Ireland, later in April where this matter will be raised.</p></reply>

The joint ESRI and Department of Finance estimates of the potential macroeconomic impacts of Brexit on the Irish economy was published on 26th March. Given both the political and economic uncertainty, a range of alternative scenarios are considered.</p>  <p>  This new study finds that, compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland ten years after Brexit would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a Deal scenario and 5.0 per cent lower in a Disorderly No-Deal scenario respectively. This assessment shows that all Brexit scenarios will imply a slower pace of growth with negative consequences throughout the economy.</p>  <p>  The study emphasises the negative impact Brexit will have on the Irish labour market. The results from the study show that, in the long-run, employment would be 1.8 per cent lower in a Deal scenario, and 3.4 per cent lower in a Disorderly No-Deal scenario respectively, compared to a situation where the UK stays in the EU.</p>  <p>  The impact would be significant with employment growth slowing sharply and unemployment rising. Tax revenue would be lower, and expenditure would rise. The general government balance would worsen by an average of &frac12; a percentage point of GDP over the medium-term, and by nearly 1 per cent over the long-term, in the disorderly no-deal Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  The deterioration in the fiscal balance would be structural, not cyclical in nature. This would reflect a permanent reduction in the size of the economy and consequently in the amount of tax revenue it generates. The implication of such an adjustment would require detailed reflection and this will be addressed in the Stability Programme Update and the Summer Economic Statement in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average. </p>  <p>  It has always been clear from the published studies, including those by the Department of Finance, that Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a negative impact on our economy and our living standards, and that this impact increases with the harder Brexit scenarios.</p>  <p>  It is imperative to boost the resilience of the Irish economy in order to minimise, in so far as is possible, any future disruption. Since the UK referendum in 2016, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit. The economic and fiscal policies, which we have pursued, mean that the economy is now in a better position to weather the impacts of Brexit.</p></reply>

There is no exemption or relief from USC and PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in their home country. </p><p>The 2016 annual Revenue report on SARP shows that for the years 2012 to 2016 (the most recent year for which data are available) the annual cost of the measure was as follows: <table><tr><th>Tax Cost 2012 </th><th>Tax Cost 2013</th><th>Tax Cost 2014</th><th>Tax Cost 2015  </th><th>Tax Cost 2016</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;0.1 million</td><td>&euro;1.9 million</td><td>&euro;5.9 million</td><td>&euro;9.5 million</td><td>&euro;18.1 million</td></tr></table></p><p>The incentive has been subject to a number of amendments during the course of its existence, with the intention of ensuring adequate uptake and also the efficiency and effectiveness of its operation. </p><p>As such, the costs represented in the above table are reflective of the eligibility criteria that applied in each year, particularly with regard to the quantum of relief that was available in a given year.</p><p>For the tax years 2012, 2013 and 2014, SARP provided relief from income tax on 30% of salary between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000. In 2015, the upper salary threshold of &euro;500,000 per annum was removed to encourage senior decision makers to come to Ireland.</p><p>Following on from concerns I had regarding the increasing cost of the incentive, I amended the SARP legislation in Finance Bill 2018 to reinstate an upper salary threshold at the level of &euro;1 million. This change came into effect for new entrants to the programme from 1 January 2019 and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020.</p><p>I do not believe it is possible to accurately estimate the amount that could be raised by abolishing SARP. While the annual cost of the incentive, as outlined in the table above, could be represented as a saving to the Exchequer were SARP abolished, there would likely be losses resulting from lower SARP related employment levels (reduced tax receipts) and other indirect effects within the activities that are supported by the Programme.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, SARP will be fully reviewed in 2019 ahead of Finance Bill 2019. This review will afford an opportunity to look at all elements of the relief. It will also include consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The R&amp;amp;D credit can also be claimed by the company as a payable credit.

Sums in respect of the credit are generally set off against Corporation Tax in the first instance and are only carried forward as a payable credit where there is insufficient tax liability in a year to absorb the full amount.

It was hoped that such matters would form part of future relationship discussions, however in light of the Government decision to intensify its preparations for a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; exit, immediate action was considered necessary on the possible emergence of Duty Free sales and VAT Retail Export Scheme, in the context of a disorderly exit. The policy was driven by the potential impact on Exchequer receipts following the introduction of the schemes, the protection of health and welfare policies and the exposure for significant fraudulent abuse of the VAT Retail Export Scheme, considering the Common Travel Area and associated significant volumes of traffic between the two islands.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government introduced two committee stage amendments to the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019. One related to Duty Free sales and the second amendment related to the application of the VAT Retail Export Scheme both in a post Brexit, &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario. </p>  <p>  As outlined in my address to the D&aacute;il on the proposed amendments, I indicated that the introduction of the measures will be dependent on the UK&rsquo;s application of the VAT Retail Export and Duty Free Schemes. That is, if the UK apply Duty Free and VAT Retail Export Schemes to UK- Ireland passenger traffic, then Ireland will similarly apply the schemes without restriction, and in that instance will not commence the sections in the Act.</p>  <p>  In the event that the UK restrict the application of the schemes on passenger traffic between the UK and Ireland then Ireland will reciprocate that approach by commencing the sections 58 and 67 in the Act.</p>  <p>  The UK have not yet publically announced their intentions for the schemes in a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit context.</p></reply>

This is a new publication by the CSO which analyses goods exports and imports with the UK in terms of the activity and size of the enterprises trading. It describes who is trading with the UK rather than what is being traded. The Trade by Enterprise Characteristics data (TEC data) published in the document cover enterprises with annual imports or exports of more than &euro;5,000. Enterprise size is determined by the number of employees. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) include micro (less than 10 employees), small (10 to 49) and medium enterprises (50 to 249). Large enterprises have 250 employees or more.</p><p>The most recent publication shows that approximately 60 per cent of the total value of goods exports to the UK in 2016 with a value of &euro;8.3 billion was from SMEs. The remaining 40 per cent was from large enterprises who exported &euro;6.2 billion of goods to the UK.</p><p>For goods imports from the UK, SMEs accounted for almost two thirds, with a value of &euro;13.1 billion. Of this amount, &euro;4.9 billion, a quarter of all UK imports, was imported by micro enterprises. Large enterprises imported &euro;6.5 billion, or one-third of all imports from the UK.</p><p>For more information please see the table below from the CSO&rsquo;s publication.</p><p><b>Table 1.

It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p>  <p>  Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements, clearly conveyed to all concerned, permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the Oireachtas and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform websites. </p>  <p>  Having considered all of the issues in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for all the reasons set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.</p></reply>

From the data collated on the scheme to date, it is clear that there has been a greater demand for the RIHL than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA if it is to continue. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has requested sanction for additional funding of &euro;200m annually for 2019 to 2021 (bringing the scheme to &euro;800m in total).</p>  <p>  I understand the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are presently carrying out an internal review of the scheme.  Further details on the review can be obtained from my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.

These include building up our fiscal buffers by balancing our books, reducing our debt burden and establishing the Rainy Day Fund.  The steady increases in public spending implemented in recent years with a particular focus on public capital investment, up c. &euro;1.4 billion in 2019, play an important role in supporting resilience in the face of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Government has implemented a number of Brexit related supports over the past three Budgets and also laid the foundation for further supports, pending the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 is based on the 'central scenario' that the UK will make an orderly agreed exit from the EU. At that time Budget 2019 also included an estimated impact of a hard exit. The Department of Finance and ESRI recently published an updated model-based assessment of the economic and budgetary impacts.  In aggregate terms, after ten years the impact of a disorderly Brexit is to reduce the level of GDP by around 5 percentage points relative to a scenario in which there was no Brexit, with the headline fiscal balance being worse by around one percentage point of GDP.  </p></reply>

Student services support each individual student achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p>  <p>  My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions. As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of student services, is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced plans for an enhancement of counselling services in higher education institutions. The strategic dialogue process and the performance compacts between the HEA and HEIs will be used to assess existing provision and delivery in this area, and in order to determine the most appropriate means of strengthening counselling services in the course of 2019.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HEA, who have made enquiries to Cork Institute of Technology (CIT), that CIT are acutely aware of the growing demand for counselling services. It is a trend that is experienced by all counselling services in Higher Education and is reflected by a growth nationally in people seeking support for mental health services.</p>  <p>  The number of students using CIT&rsquo;s Student Counselling Service has constantly risen over the past ten years, however, the overall spend in counselling services within CIT has also increased.

This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. </p><p>The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will commence later in 2019. The patronage process for the remainder of the new schools will also be run at a later date, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website <i>()</i>and the Department&rsquo;s website (  <i>www.education.ie). </i></p><p>It is intended that the permanent school building will be developed on the zoned school site within the  Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) residential development at Corballis, Donabate. </p><p>The school will be delivered under the Department's Design &amp;amp; Build Programme. This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Manager to progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning and construction.  A tender competition to establish a Project Manager framework is nearing completion.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to the Department.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards. The Department has agreed to arrange a meeting with the Union.</p></reply>

I will address these, prior to outlining the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. </p><p>My Department understands that a representative of the Archdiocese of Dublin wrote to schools in the Portmarnock, Malahide, Kinsealy and Yellow Walls areas on 5 April last in relation to the consultation that had been undertaken by the Archdiocese with a number of schools under its patronage in these areas. I understand that this correspondence indicates that any vote which may have been planned by the schools involved should be postponed, pending the publication of the Identification Phase report for this area as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. My Department intends to publish the Identification Phase reports in the first half of this year.</p><p>For clarity, I wish to confirm that in relation to the phase 1 pilot areas, including Malahide/Portmarnock, the Implementation Phase of the process has not yet commenced.  </p><p>Prior to the letter issuing on the 5 April, I understand that representatives of the Dublin Archdiocese had been holding meetings with a number of primary schools under their patronage in the Malahide and Portmarnock area to provide information to them on the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. Letters/leaflets received by parents were not based on information provided by my Department. These letters and leaflets contained incorrect information which led to unnecessary confusion. At no stage did the Department seek to impose any artificial deadline on this process  and there has never been a requirement for any transfer of patronage to take place in September 2019.</p><p>My Department has received a number of queries on relation to traditional religious celebrations and festivals.  For clarity, non-denominational schools are not required to ask pupils not to mark or celebrate or learn about religious festivals or events or times of the year and occasions that would historically have a religious connotation or connection. There is clear guidance on the teaching of religion in primary schools and multi-denominational schools deliver the national primary curriculum in the same way as all schools and are subject to the same rules and regulations, regardless of patron. Many multi-denominational schools celebrate various important religious and non-religious events that take place throughout the year such as Christmas, Diwali, Eid, Vaisakhi, Holi, Darwin Day and other festivals. Many multi-denominational schools have symbols and images on display in the school which may reflect the different religions and beliefs of children attending the school and special times of year may also be marked with particular images and artefacts. It can be seen, therefore, that significant festivals or events which may be associated with a particular religion can play a part in the life of a multi-denominational school.</p><p>Transfer of patronage and consultation with school communities on Reconfiguration is a matter for the current patron (i.e. the Dublin Archdiocesan representatives in the case of the schools under Catholic patronage in Malahide and Portmarnock) in the first instance. Any concerns or views that parents have in relation to such events should be discussed with the school patron. My Department, as part of this process, is not involved in the selection of any school for reconfiguration.</p><p>In relation to the Schools Reconfiguration process, as the Deputies will be aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment of reaching 400 multi-/non-denominational schools in Ireland by the year 2030. The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. </p><p>The process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide.</p><p><b>Identification Phase</b></p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there is likely to be an oncoming demand for more diversity of patronage within the local educational provision. Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. ETBs, having analysed the survey results, then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. </p><p>The response of the Bishop to any identified oncoming demand for greater diversity of school patronage in the area is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, which will publish the reports on its website, www.education.ie. Not all of the Identification Phase reports from these 16 initial areas have been finalised. It is envisaged that the reports will be published in the first half of this year. </p><p><b>Implementation Phase</b></p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase.</p><p>It is intended that the Implementation Phase would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. </p><p>In the Implementation Phase, the existing patron (the Catholic Archbishop/Bishop), would identify a school to transfer to a multi-denominational or non-denominational patron (where the Identification Phase report has shown a viable level of demand for greater diversity of patronage). </p><p>The process envisages that the identification of a new multi-denominational or non-denominational patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community.  It will be up to the relevant school patron (i.e. the Catholic Archbishop/Bishop) to discuss with their school communities the choices that could be made.  </p><p>It is also envisaged that the existing patron would provide information to parents on the multi-denominational/non-denominational options available and engage in a consultative process with the school community.For example, the existing patron may wish to arrange a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. </p><p>Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. </p><p>I recently had a very constructive meeting with Irish Episcopal Conference representatives in relation to a number of matters including Reconfiguration. The Bishops reiterated their commitment to the Reconfiguration process. Further engagement is planned in this regard and I look forward to working positively with the Bishops on this matter in a spirit of continued partnership.</p><p>Further to the Deputy Daly's query on options open to parents in relation to multi or non-denominational education, it is also possible for a patron to transfer patronage of a school to a multi-denominational patron outside of the main Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. There are a number of instances where school communities directly engaged their patron and sought a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron.  For example, the &lsquo;early movers&rsquo; provision fast-tracks patronage reassignment.  The first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; provision should contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student that these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy</p></reply>

This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process. </p>  <p>  The Primary Education Forum was established in September 2018 and aims to support the planning and sequencing of change in the primary school sector and to exchange information on the intent and impacts of the actions in the Action Plan for Education in order to look for synergies and opportunities to streamline implementation and address workload issues.</p>  <p>  Membership represents key personnel from the Department, school management, and representatives of school leadership and representatives of teachers, with the Forum akin to a working group in scale.</p>  <p>  Through adopting this approach, my Department and partners have already agreed to make several changes to the pace and sequence of planned reforms. These include the decision to re-schedule the implementation of the Primary Mathematics Curriculum to give teachers the time to expand on their understanding and engage more fully with the new curriculum and to allow for further supports to be developed for teachers. Also, I took the decision to pace the commencement of the Education (Admission to schools) Act 2018 by initially focusing on regulations relating to the essential key features of the Act and there was agreement to consult with the sector on the regulations to be put in place alongside the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:  </p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, </p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools, </p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department's review of provision at post-primary level across the school planning areas in the South Kildare area is now complete.  </p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the needs in the area can be met through the replacement and expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary School with a new 1,000 pupil school building. It is intended that the expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary school, a multi-denominational Community College under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB), will also cater for demand arising in the adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas. There is existing capacity in the Curragh Post-Primary school pending delivery of the new school building.  </p>  <p>  A new site will be required for the school and the Department has commenced the site identification process. Due to commercial sensitivities surrounding site acquisitions in general, I cannot comment further at this point in the process, though I can assure the Deputy that my Department will make every effort to progress the matter. In line with protocols for the use of State property assets my Department has written to the Department of Defence regarding the school site requirement and will engage with that Department further in this regard in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Some initial engagement had taken place in relation to the potential for Educate Together to become a Trustee Partner for the school in a similar arrangement to those implemented elsewhere (e.g. Clonturk Community College with City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB) as patron of the school and Educate Together as a Trustee Partner). I understand that it is intended that there will be further engagement on this matter shortly.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards. The Department has agreed to arrange a meeting with the Union.</p></reply>

This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p><p>The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Primary and Post primary Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools.</p><p>All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans or Student Support plans for children who are receiving additional teaching or care in schools, including children with Down syndrome.</p><p>Whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of Individual Education Plan, it is evident that the majority of schools do use some form of education planning to plan and record the support that they provide for pupils with special educational needs. This is considered to be both beneficial for schools and children and is regarded as best practice.  </p><p>The ongoing provision of planning will represent a continuation of the good practice that is occurring in the majority of schools.</p><p>In relation to training and support for teachers in the provision of special education needs support, the Department provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Regional Support Service, which has incorporated the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired and Hearing Impaired, provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers. </p><p>It is also enhancing the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behaviour. The SESS, has a role to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes. </p><p>Through applications to NCSE&rsquo;s Supports Service, schools and individual teachers can access support in all areas of special education, including support in relation to individualised educational planning.</p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) also provides guidance for schools in supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>NEPS works with schools through the Continuum of Support framework.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.  </p><p>NEPS psychologists provide advice and support around the identification of needs, the use of evidence-informed interventions and the monitoring of outcomes for individuals and groups of children. Psychologists can also advise and assist schools on effective whole-school practices, early intervention approaches and good deployment of Special Education Teaching supports.</p><p>This Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested. This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 at present.</p><p>Special classes by 160% to over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Special education teachers by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,400 at present.</p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

In relation to the use of schools for the specific purpose of school age childcare, my officials participated in the interdepartmental group that produced the Action Plan on School Age childcare that was published in March 2017.  Following that report, the then Minister and his officials engaged directly with the management bodies, patrons and property owners.  A set of guidelines, designed to assist the owners of school buildings who wished to provide childcare services in their schools was published by my Department in October 2017. </p><p>These guidelines can be viewed on the Department's website at this link: <i></i>.  This year, the Department intends to conduct a review of the guidelines and they will be updated accordingly following the review.  </p><p>Another commitment in the report was to consider the qualification needs of those working in school age childcare as part of a wider review of qualifications for the sector.  The Department is working closely with QQI and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this matter.  DES is supporting DCYA as they implement their commitments in the Action Plan in relation to developing quality standards for school age childcare, elements of which will relate to the nature and level of qualifications that may be appropriate for those providing that service.  It is intended that a workforce development plan to commence in 2019 and led by DCYA in close collaboration with DES will consider this matter in further detail.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.500.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900068#WRK02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 to 246, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (&ldquo;the Convention&rdquo;) is one of sustained and on-going improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities.  It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD, and the NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, will have an important role in guiding progress in this area.  The Group is committed to carrying out a mid-term review of the Strategy by the end of 2019 and in the context of this review,  it is expected that it will examine how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention.  The National Disability Authority (NDA) will also play a critical part in the implementation of the Convention, and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have responsibility for a significant number of actions under the Strategy.  The HSE National Service Plan 2019, which was published earlier this year, is focussed on providing supports to people with disabilities and enabling them to maximise their full potential as independently as possible.  Measures in the Service Plan will also reduce the waiting times for Assessments of Need for children through the provision of 100 additional therapist posts.</p>  <p>  Including the additional funding I secured for use in the Service Plan, this brings the total investment in the provision of disability services to almost &euro;1.9bn in 2019. </p>  <p>  Article 19 of the Convention deals with living independently and being included in the community.  It provides that persons with disabilities should have access to a range of in-home, residential and other community support services. </p>  <p>  In the 2019 Service Plan, the HSE will provide 1.53m personal assistant hours to 2,535 people, and 3.08m home support hours for 8,094 people.</p>  <p>  To meet obligations under Article 12, and Article 7, addressing rights for children with disabilities, additional funding of &euro;12m has been allocated to meet the cost of providing day supports and services for approximately 1,500 young adults who will leave school in 2019.  Under the plan, the HSE will move up to 160 people from large institutional settings to homes in the community.  Ninety new high-acuity emergency residential places will also be funded in 2019 to address urgent unplanned cases as they arise.</p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.</p>  <p>   New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced.  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively.  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April 2017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented.  In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy.</p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined above, the Deputies will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published on December 2016. Second Stage (D&aacute;il) took place on 31 January and 1 February 2017, and Committee Stage on 30 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention.  It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding.  The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles.</p>  <p>  The IHREC established a Disability Advisory Committee in January 2019, composed of a diverse group of persons with lived experience of disability.  This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The IHREC is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA.</p>  <p>  The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues and is carrying out work in a range of areas to support implementation; including the preparation of non-healthcare Codes of Practice under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and review of progress with respect to the key indicators of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  Significant year on year budgetary increases in the disability sector have positively impacted the lived experience of people with disabilities in Ireland.  However, it is recognised that daily challenges remain for many people with disabilities and their families.  Addressing the needs and rights of people living with a disability and their families is a priority for this Government and my primary focus as Minister of State for Disability Issues.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supports that priority in providing a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of those rights.</p></reply>

These are crimes that have a significant impact on both businesses and communities and I condemn the criminals behind them in the strongest terms. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that there is already strong ongoing co-operation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI, and both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are conducting investigations into these robberies.  I am confident that those responsible will be identified. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have confirmed that there have been three incidents of ATM robberies in this State, most recently the ATM robberies in Castleblaney, Co. Monaghan in April; Kingscourt, Co. Cavan in March; and one in Ballybay, Co. Monaghan in December 2018.  There were no recorded incidents between 2012 and 2017, however there was an attempted robbery in Co. Wicklow in May 2011 and in Co. Carlow in 2010.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that Garda&iacute; continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in the State to ensure all resources are allocated in an effective manner and that the best possible police service is provided to the public.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputies that there are a number of avenues through which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work with the PSNI to combat organised crime and other cross-Border issues.  There is a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy operated between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, which covers a range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Joint Agency Task Force established under the Fresh Start Agreement engages An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in a lead role (with other agencies) in structured strategic and operational co-operation in combatting cross-Border organised crime, while the Cross-Border Seminar on Organised Crime is an annual event.  It is organised jointly by the two Justice Departments and the two police services and it focuses on co-operation and best practice in countering organised crime that seeks to exploit the Border.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that this type of co-operation can continue into the future is a key priority for me and my Department, in any Brexit outcome.</p></reply>

I also sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the circumstances.</p>  <p>  I should mention that earlier this year the Seanad passed a motion in the same terms as those of the D&aacute;il motion.</p>  <p>  At the end of January, I was notified by GSOC that their investigation relating to possible breaches of Garda disciplinary regulations had concluded.  The report and recommendations of that GSOC investigation were sent to the Garda Commissioner.  The family were also informed by GSOC of the completion of the investigation.  The outcome of the investigation was a recommendation that a number of Garda officers should be subject of a disciplinary process.  That is now a matter entirely for the Garda Commissioner and I do not propose to comment further on the matter.</p>  <p>  In any event, following the completion of the GSOC process and having informed the Government of the approach I proposed to take, I appointed recently retired District Court Judge Gerard Haughton, to conduct a scoping exercise and to advise me in relation to the case.</p>  <p>  I met with members of the family to inform them of the decision.  I subsequently provided them with a copy of the terms of reference for Judge Haughton's scoping exercise and invited them to give their views on those terms of reference to Judge Haughton.  </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton has met with the family to discuss the terms of reference and to seek their input into any amendments which might be required.  In light of his engagement with the family, Judge Haughton will report back to me with any proposals to amend the terms of reference.  Once the terms have been settled and he has commenced his scoping exercise, he is required to provide an interim report to me within 8 weeks indicating, inter alia, the expected timeframe for completion of the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  As it stands, Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendation he sees fit, including the freedom to recommend the establishment of any of the various forms of statutory and non-statutory inquiry.  If he recommends an inquiry, of whatever type, I have asked him to provide me with draft terms of reference. </p>  <p>  As for the time it took GSOC to investigate complaints, that is a matter entirely for GSOC.  I'm sure the Deputy will appreciate, that the volume and nature of complaints received by the Commission in relation to this incident required a thorough investigation in order that the outcome would be seen to be fair and reasonable.  I know that it can be frustrating that investigations are not completed as quickly as people would like.   However, our overriding concern must be that investigations are comprehensive and conducted to the highest standards. </p>  <p>  It is the case that GSOC had been seeking further staffing resources to handle the volume of complaints received.  I'm pleased that late last year GSOC received sanction for all the additional personnel resources it had sought.  I am confident that this will result in the timeframe for investigations improving going forward.</p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. </p><p>In general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process. </p><p>Processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with INIS.  In certain instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered.  In other instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application. </p><p>This is a complex application process which requires a considerable level of detailed supporting documentation and sometimes the input of several government agencies, both within and without this jurisdiction. The request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications.</p><p>The INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 commits the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications.  Such developments are expected to deliver significant improvements to customer experiences and processing timescales. </p><p>The final stage of a naturalisation application requires the applicant to attend at a citizenship ceremony.  Citizenship ceremony days take place periodically throughout the year, at which up to 3,000 candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State, give an undertaking to uphold the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values and receive their certificate of naturalisation. The date a decision is made on an application in relation to when the next available ceremony is due to take place can also impact on the length of time between the submission of the application and the applicant becoming an Irish citizen.</p><p>INIS devotes considerable resources to the processing of these applications. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The report serves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for operational purposes and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) for statistical purposes. The RSA has a statutory remit to collect, compile and publish information obtained from the C(T)68 form for national or international planning, policy research and development, monitoring and reporting purposes.

The report recommended that the forensic functions of the Garda Technical Bureau be divested to Forensic Science Ireland. This recommendation was accepted by Government and responsibility for the forensic services is now being transferred to Forensic Science Ireland, where a mix of civilian scientists and experienced Garda members will provide such services. The scenes of crime services will also progress towards civilianisation, with care being taken to ensure at all times that the personnel involved have the experience and qualifications required to provide a service to the best international standards. </p>  <p>  The Government supports the Garda Commissioner in his proposals to redeploy Garda Members to front line duties.  This approach is very much in line with the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland which was approved by Government in December.   Civilianisation of roles and redeployment are among the key projects  being progressed in 2019 in the Implementation Plan which I published in December - A Policing Service for the Future - and I am confident the full realisation of these projects will deliver a better policing service to the public. </p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.    </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service.   </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.   </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress preparation of the codes of practice.    </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.   </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.   </p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p></reply>

The intention is to move beyond the testimonial and anecdotal evidence we have that projects work well and provide a good service, to capture precisely what specific interventions work best, document this evidence, and roll out learning across all the projects over a period of years.  The actions will include:</p><p>- examination of what makes for a successful relationship between a young participant and a Youth Justice Worker (success being understood as facilitation of real change in the young person&rsquo;s attitudes and life that would not otherwise happen);</p><p>- articulating the contribution that a GYDP makes in tackling crime in a community; and</p><p>- assessment of the contribution that &lsquo;up-stream&rsquo; agencies and interventions can make to crime reduction and making appropriate recommendations.</p><p>At present, there are some 106 GYDPs operating around the country, catering for approximately 4,000 young people every year. In general, the location of projects is linked to local needs and the levels of youth crime. The existing network of GYDPs has developed organically over three decades and I am committed to ensuring that it continues to develop so that every young person has access to these very valuable programmes, and that they are delivered to the highest standard possible.</p><p>Furthermore, I am chairing an expert Steering Group to guide the development of a new Youth Justice Strategy. One of the areas the group will look at is Diversion away from the Justice System. This will include the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and the GYDPs which act to support it. </p><p>All of this work will help to further develop and enhance, over time and as resources allow, the approach to the location of new projects, in Co. Cork and elsewhere, within the overarching objective that all young people in need of such a service have access to a project in their area.<table><tr><th>Garda Division </th><th>Project Name</th><th>Amount of funding allocated </th><th>Number of Youth Justice Workers Employed</th></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY</td><td>Ballincollig Action Project</td><td>&euro;143,208</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Douglas West</td><td>&euro;128,575</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FAYRE</td><td>&euro;111,259</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GAP</td><td>&euro;177,641</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HERON</td><td>&euro;103,667</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Knocknaheeney/Hollyhill</td><td>&euro;107,011</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAY</td><td>&euro;103,729</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TACT</td><td>&euro;115,955</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;991,045</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Feabhas</td><td>&euro;109,381</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mallow</td><td>&euro;112,168</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH</td><td>Mobile Diversion</td><td>&euro;220,643</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Youghal</td><td>&euro;122,321</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;564,513</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST</td><td>Bandon Youth </td><td>&euro;172,354</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;172,354</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;1,727,912</td><td><br /><br />28</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure optimum use is made of the resources.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that recent census data is currently being incorporated into the personnel allocation model. I understand that Census information received on a specific county format is amended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service to reflect Garda Divisional boundaries. However, it should be noted that ratios such as the number of Garda per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources as they fail to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the population to Garda and station ratio is not readily available in my Department as the recording of the population by area is a matter for the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. The Government remains committed to the recruitment of additional Garda&iacute; and accordingly has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the redeployment of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.</p></reply>

That&rsquo;s why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and, in particular, to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 1st March last and there will be a further call for proposals this year.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. </p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leverages up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme, announced in Budget 2019, will be open for applications through the SBCI online portal from 17 April.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.631.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900071#WRN00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 to 294, inclusive, together.</p><p>I am very well aware of the skills shortages currently being experienced in the construction sector.  The issue is all the more pressing given the strong economic growth being experienced and the high demand being placed on the sector to respond to a range of construction needs across the economy.  I have also met with Construction Industry Federation representatives to discuss the labour and skills challenges in the sector.  </p><p>Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national subject to the Employment Permits Acts and Regulations.  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills Occupations List and the Ineligible Occupations List for the purposes of granting an employment permit</p><p>The occupation lists for employment permit purposes are reviewed twice yearly to ensure that the employment permit system is supportive of the economy by maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising any disruption to the domestic/EEA labour market.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the National Skills Council, input from relevant Government Departments and a public consultation process.  Account is also taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Project 2040 and Brexit. </p><p>A review of the occupation lists for employment permit purposes has just concluded.  A number of submissions were received from the construction industry.  Officials from my Department met bilaterally with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to discuss the Construction Sector in particular.  In addition, all submissions and evidence were considered by the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department, and on which the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is also represented.  Consequently, I announced the following changes in relation to jobs in the construction sector,</p><p>The Critical Skills Occupations List will now include:</p><p>- Civil Engineers,</p><p>- Quantity Surveyors,</p><p>- Construction Project Managers</p><p>- Mechanical and Electrical Engineers with BIM expertise.</p><p>The following occupations will be removed from the Ineligible Occupations List and will be eligible for a General Employment Permit:</p><p>- Sheet metal workers</p><p>- Welding trades</p><p>- Pipefitters</p><p>- Air-Conditioning &amp;amp; Refrigeration Engineers</p><p>- Shuttering Carpenters</p><p>- Glaziers, window fabricators &amp;amp; fitters</p><p>- Scaffolders, stagers &amp;amp; riggers</p><p>- Crane drivers</p><p>- Plasterers subject to a quota of 250</p><p>- Bricklayers subject to a quota of 250</p><p>The next review is planned for April 2019, and a call for further submissions from the construction sector will be made at that time.</p><p>Ireland operates a managed employment permits system which maximises the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and where the positions on offer cannot be reasonably filled from within Ireland, Switzerland and the EEA.  An examination of the operation of the Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT) was included in the Review of Economic Migration Policy which was published in September 2018.  From engagement with stakeholders and the public consultation there is widespread support for retention of the LMNT, however the report recommended a modernisation and extension.</p><p>My Department will be implementing the following specific LMNT recommendations as part of the ongoing action plan to deliver on all the reviews recommendations.</p><p>- The duration of the LMNT will be extended from two weeks to four weeks to ensure a meaningful engagement with the EURES portal.</p><p>- The LMNT process will be amended to reflect modern advertising methods. This will be addressed in new Employment Permit Act following consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>- My Department in co-operation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will develop and deliver a communications strategy to raise awareness of the components of the LMNT process which need to be undertaken prior to the submission of an employment permit application.</p><p>Currently, in order to assist with the application process, the Department has produced a suite of information including details on how to carry out the Labour Market Needs Test and various employer checklist documents which, if followed, should result in the granting of an employment permit.  This information can be found in the Employment Permit section of my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.  It should be noted that the majority of non-EEA nationals earning over &euro;60,000 applying for work permits apply in respect of Critical Skills Employment Permits for which there is no LMNT requirement.</p></reply>

In 2018, the inflation rate in Ireland was 0.7%, which was the lowest in the euro area, and the joint lowest in the EU. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this strong position, addressing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government.  We continue to monitor Ireland's cost base and to analyse the factors that are crucial to improving our competitiveness.</p>  <p>  A range of initiatives are in train across Departments to: enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity; improve the ease of doing business; reduce the administrative burden businesses face; and, drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. </p>  <p>  Significantly, my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach have recently published Future Jobs Ireland, a cross-government initiative with a strong focus on improving productivity. </p>  <p>  This initiative has proposed concrete and ambitious actions to enhance our productivity and competitiveness and will ensure that we are well positioned to adapt to transformational changes the economy will face in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Increasing productivity is the only long-term sustainable way of increasing the standard of living for our people, and there are a range of specific initiatives in train across Government to enhance our competitiveness performance, including:</p>  <p>  The review of SME policy designed to assess the SME business ecosystem and the range of supports offered to SMEs being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the OECD;</p>  <p>  The development of an Industry 4.0 strategy to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of digital technologies; and</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme that will allow businesses to borrow for up to 10 years to support capital investment and enhance their competitiveness.</p></reply>

Whilst this report assesses the impact that the adoption of digital technologies has on Ireland&rsquo;s workforce, the focus was broader than just the impact of artificial intelligence on employment in the services industry.  &lsquo;Digital Transformation&rsquo; focusses on the impact of the adoption of a number of new technologies (including artificial intelligence) on all sectors, occupations and regions of the economy over the years 2018-2023.</p><p>The report projects strong overall growth for the economy over the next five years.  Whilst the report predicts that the number of jobs lost to the adoption of digital technologies will increase steadily over the next decade, it expects that the vast majority of sectors will employ more people in 2023 than they did in 2018. </p><p>The report highlighted how Ireland has the opportunity to place itself at the forefront of digital technologies through ensuring adequate skills provision and capitalising on Ireland&rsquo;s significant ICT sector.  It finds that existing Government policies and initiatives provide a solid foundation for the response to the expected changes arising from the increased adoption of digital technologies.  Table 1 (below) provides the current policies and initiatives in place that align with the key policy implications arising from the report. It demonstrates the various ways in which Government are acting to embrace the benefits arising from digital transformation and also to mitigate the potential negative impacts on the workforce.</p><p>The report also highlights how increased career changes and workforce transitions will be a feature of the future.  To ensure that these transitions are smooth, the continuous engagement of the workforce in education will be vital. In particular, it will be crucial that the workforce is equipped with the right transversal skills to manage changing job roles and career transitions. This underlines the importance of lifelong learning amongst the workforce. The concept of lifelong learning where each individual has an education and training programme they follow throughout their career will become more of an imperative.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has a number of policies and initiatives in this area which are aimed at increasing lifelong learning rates and the development of transversal skills at all stages of the education system.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 acknowledges that transversal skills are becoming ever more important to an individuals&rsquo; successful and sustainable employment.  Over the course of the Strategy, it aims to teach students at all stages of education and training a strong mix of transversal skills and subject knowledge.  Particular emphasis is being placed on ICT skills, language proficiency and entrepreneurship in light of their importance to employability, personal development and civic participation.</p><p>Another policy with a major focus on upskilling and reskilling the working age population is Solas&rsquo; &lsquo;Skills to Advance&rsquo; employee development policy framework.  Launched in 2018, this is aimed at developing the skills of people in employment.  This new policy framework provides key guidance, direction and targets for Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in supporting the upskilling of those in employment, working both directly with learners, and through their employers.</p><p>&lsquo;Skills to Advance&rsquo; will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce, with a particular focus on employees who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities.  The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), engaged in state supported skills development by 2021.</p><p>The policy also supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who need assistance to invest in and develop their workforce.  While employers continue to be primarily responsible for the skills development of their employees, and employees also have responsibility for their own development, this policy will complement employer-based and State initiatives underway through targeted support and investment by Government.  This year, ETBs are being allocated an additional &euro;11million in funding for implementation of &lsquo;Skills to Advance&rsquo;.</p><p>In addition to these measures, Future Jobs Ireland, the Government's new medium-term policy framework published recently, aims to drive Ireland&rsquo;s development as a resilient and innovative economy, capable of coping with the transformational changes ahead posed by automation, artificial intelligence and other forms of technological innovation. Embracing innovation and technological change is one of Future Jobs Ireland&rsquo;s key pillars.  There are a number of ambitions and deliverables outlined in this respect including to assist this, including, the establishment of Top Teams to realise opportunities presented by artificial intelligence, the delivery of a national artificial intelligence strategy and the development of transition teams to assist workers and sectors likely to be most challenged by our changing economy.  Each of these deliverables are expected to be completed by the end of Q4 2019. </p><p>Table 1 Current Policies and Initiatives in Place Addressing Five Key Areas of Focus<table><tr><th>Key Areas</th><th>Policies and Initiatives    Addressing Areas</th></tr><tr><td>Vision  </td><td>National Digital Strategy</td></tr><tr><td>Collaboration </td><td>R&amp;amp;D Technology Centres/Gateways<br /><br />Innovation Partnerships<br /><br />SFI Industry Fellowships</td></tr><tr><td>Data </td><td>National Data Infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>Technology </td><td>Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund<br /><br />Industry 4.0 Strategy</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Skills</td><td>National Skills Strategy 2025<br /><br />ICT Action Plan<br /><br />National Digital Strategy for Schools<br /><br />Skills for Growth Initiative<br /><br />Spotlight on Skills<br /><br />Skillnet Ireland<br /><br />Springboard+<br /><br />EXPLORE </td></tr></table></p></reply>

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility.  Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m.  This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p>  <p>  These developments have taken place in the context of the wider, whole-of-Government response to Brexit.  This has included the &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public information events around Ireland and campaign to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place. </p>  <p>  These events have brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments, including my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses. </p>  <p>  Further Brexit-preparedness events have been organised by the network of Local Enterprise Offices, InterTrade Ireland, the NSAI and the HSA.  Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  Given the ongoing uncertainty around the terms and final date of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, the funding allocation to the current advisory and financial supports for Brexit preparation will be kept under review to ensure businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities which may arise.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900071#WRN03000"><p>The Chamber of Commerce referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy issues a gift card that expires after 12 months, though this can be extended for a further ninety days on payment of &euro;9.95 by the gift card holder.  The costs of operating the scheme in partnership with a UK-based gift card provider are met from monies on gift cards not fully redeemed during the 12-month expiry period.  The Chamber&rsquo;s concern is that the proposed five-year term for gift vouchers will require it to change the business and revenue model on which its scheme is based and that the alternative revenue models open to it will reduce the attractiveness of the scheme to businesses and consumers and have a negative impact on the local economy. </p>  <p>  While I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Chamber concerned and am a strong supporter of the shop local gift card schemes that operate in a number of towns throughout the country, I do not  propose to make any changes to the provision for a five-year minimum term for gift vouchers.  In its submission to the Department&rsquo;s consultation on gift voucher fees and expiry dates, Chambers Ireland which represents 43 affiliated Chambers, including the Chamber referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy, indicated that five years was a reasonable minimum term for gift vouchers.  Though some eighteen Chambers currently operate local gift card schemes, the Chamber in question is the only Chamber to have expressed concern about the expiry date provision.  There was broad support for the provision from all parties, including from the Deputy, during the recent debates on the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Other considerations apart, it would be anomalous, confusing and unfair to have a different mandatory minimum term apply to gift vouchers supplied under local gift voucher schemes than to the vouchers issued by the individual retailers and service providers who participate in such schemes.  </p>  <p>  While it is not for me to advise the Chamber in question on the type of gift card scheme it should operate, I am aware that a number of other Chambers issue local gift vouchers in partnership with a provider of electronic money gift vouchers.  These Chambers clearly take the view that this type of voucher offers a viable business and revenue model for their schemes.  Gift cards issued by an electronic money provider benefit also from the requirements of the Electronic Money Directive on the safeguarding of the funds held in electronic money instruments.   </p>  <p>  While the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill provides that gift vouchers must be valid for a term of at least five years, it does not regulate the point at which, and the conditions under which, businesses can treat unredeemed balances on gift vouchers as revenues and not as liabilities.  I understand that the guidance prepared by a number of accountancy firms on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers) suggests that where businesses have historical data on patterns of gift voucher redemption, they might not necessarily have to wait until a mandatory five-year or other expiry period has fully elapsed before they can claim unredeemed vouchers as revenue.  This is a matter however for the issuers of gift cards and their accountants and is not one on which I can provide guidance.</p></reply>

This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of the capital in the Agency's history.  The last year has also seen more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions.</p><p>The table below shows the number of IDA supported jobs by county from 2016 to 2018. </p><p><b>Table A: IDA jobs by County 2016-2018</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,203</td><td>1,155</td><td>1,096</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>3,039</td><td>3,392</td><td>3,564</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>803</td><td>884</td><td>909</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3,603</td><td>3,764</td><td>3,903</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>137</td><td>150</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2,341</td><td>2,238</td><td>2,251</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>83,381</td><td>90,529</td><td>96,760</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>9,740</td><td>8,452</td><td>8,838</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,661</td><td>1,565</td><td>1,632</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,234</td><td>2,230</td><td>2,618</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>131</td><td>134</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>783</td><td>745</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1,107</td><td>1,167</td><td>1,232</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,749</td><td>2,973</td><td>3,466</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6,746</td><td>7,006</td><td>6,948</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>9,827</td><td>10,607</td><td>11,796</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North Riding</td><td>328</td><td>335</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>802</td><td>875</td><td>1,150</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>762</td><td>716</td><td>711</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South Riding</td><td>3,040</td><td>3,330</td><td>3,516</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>6,253</td><td>6,690</td><td>7,064</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,740</td><td>2,987</td><td>3,139</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>35,335</td><td>36,780</td><td>38,867</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2,097</td><td>2,187</td><td>2,241</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17,041</td><td>18,503</td><td>19,969</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>4,214</td><td>4,484</td><td>4,828</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>985</td><td>1,139</td><td>1,171</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>203,082</td><td>215,017</td><td>229,057</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Girls and women who have undergone FGM are at risk of suffering from health complications throughout their lives.  The HSE is committed to progressing health-related elements of FGM with specific reference to awareness-raising among communities, staff information, training of healthcare providers and other relevant frontline professionals, and support for survivors of FGM and those at risk, in addition to data collection. </p>  <p>  The HSE has funded and disseminated an FGM resource pack for health professionals and relevant staff in maternity and associated settings.  The HSE funds a specialist clinic operated by the Irish Family Planning Association (IFPA) for girls and women who have undergone FGM.  Furthermore, the HSE funds AkiDwA to work closely with at-risk communities to raise awareness and provide information on the detrimental effects of FGM, and that it is a criminal offence in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In January this year, my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration, David Stanton and I launched the new HSE Intercultural Health Strategy.  It contains two actions on FGM:</p>  <p>  - Continue to develop and implement education and public awareness campaigns, among all health professionals and communities affected by female genital mutilation (FGM), to raise awareness that it is a criminal offence under the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act (2012) to perform FGM, or to remove a girl from the State for the purpose of FGM.</p>  <p>  - Provide training to increase the knowledge and competence of healthcare providers, and other relevant frontline professionals, in relation to appropriate care and protection for FGM survivors and women and girls at risk nationwide.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge and support this important work and discussions regarding further actions on FGM are ongoing.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussion between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme. </p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p></reply>

The first is the automated deduction of union subscriptions. The second is the refusal by the HSE to engage in negotiations with the PNA or to recognise the PNA as representing ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  To be clear, NASRA, which is affiliated with the PNA, is a group which is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights. The PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of a number of unions. These are SIPTU, FORSA and UNITE.  The deduction of subscriptions is not a legal right but rather a concession granted to recognised unions. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken this industrial action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  Officials from the Department have met with representatives of the HSE and the management of National Ambulance Service to explore possible options. However, this is a complex, challenging situation. </p>  <p>  Industrial relations policy has had a long standing objective of avoiding fragmentation in worker representation in public sector employments, and the trade union movement generally, so as to facilitate the orderly conduct of bargaining and other aspects of industrial relations.</p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is in progress and the Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess. The recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s Report will be considered during the ongoing process of drafting this Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The specific provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme. These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority, the establishment of which the Bill will provide for. The Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child. Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed. However, commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme does not regulate Irish citizens being involved in international commercial surrogacy agreements in other countries. However, the Department of Justice and Equality published a guidance document in 2012 on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State. The purpose of this document is to provide information to prospective intending parents on the steps necessary to ensure that a child born abroad through a surrogacy arrangement may enter and reside in the State and to secure the best interests of the child.  This guidance document is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p></reply>

Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges, as well as 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. The Access Plan also sets out activity levels for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) who, following an increase in funding in Budget 2019 to &euro;75 million, will supply additionality to HSE activity by arranging both insourced and outsourced appointments and treatments to reduce waiting times experienced by patients. </p>  <p>  This year the Plan will place a particular focus on ten high volume procedures, including cataracts, joint replacements, tonsils and angiograms. Through the combined activity of the HSE and the NTPF, projections are that for these procedures, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. Projections under the Plan aim to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list for hospital operations and procedures from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000. </p>  <p>  The Access Plan ensures an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. The NTPF will do this by inviting public hospitals to seek solutions for very long waiters either in the private sector or through insourcing. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

In the event that he or she is satisfied that the individual is suffering from a mental disorder as defined in section 3 of the 2001 Act, he or she will make a recommendation that the individual be involuntarily admitted.</p>  <p>  The third step requires the Consultant Psychiatrist on duty in the psychiatric hospital or unit to then examine the individual. If the Consultant Psychiatrist is satisfied that the individual is suffering from a mental disorder as defined in section 3 of the 2001 Act, then he or she will make an order admitting the individual.</p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 authorises a member of the Garda&iacute; who has reasonable grounds for believing that an individual is suffering from a mental disorder and that because of the mental disorder there is a serious likelihood of the individual causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons, to either take the individual into custody, or enter by force any dwelling or other premises or any place if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the individual is to be found there.  Where the individual is taken into custody, a member of the Garda&iacute; then makes the application to a Registered Medical Practitioner for a recommendation.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 reported in 2015 and the draft heads of an amending bill based on the recommendations of the Expert Group will soon be sent to the Mental Health Commission for review.  The Expert Group did not recommend any significant change to the current provisions regarding the authority currently vested in the Garda&iacute; under the 2001 Act to take individuals into custody with a view to having the individual assessed for admission to a psychiatric hospital or unit on an involuntary basis.</p>  <p>  On that basis, I have no plans to amend legislation to remove the authority of Garda&iacute; to take individuals into custody under the 2001 Act.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that the LTI Scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  In order to determine how much an applicant will contribute to the cost of their care, a financial assessment is carried out by the HSE which takes account of a person's income and assets.  </p>  <p>  Where a resident under the NHSS has assets including land or property, they may defer their contribution to care based on such assets under Ancillary State Support (also known as Nursing Home Loan). This contribution becomes payable on their death. However, where the asset concerned is the principal residence of the surviving partner of the person who has died, the surviving partner may request that repayment of the loan is further deferred for their lifetime. A person wishing to apply for a further deferral, or a representative acting on their behalf, must apply for such a deferral not later than 3 months after the death of the applicant. In compelling circumstances, an application may be made up until 6 months after the death of the applicant. The application should be made on the form specified by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The person in question should contact their local HSE Nursing Homes Support Scheme Office who can assist them on an individual basis to understand the factors that they need to consider.</p></reply>

Issuing letters to all prescribers and pharmacists in relation to new European Medicines Agency (EMA) and HPRA guidelines on the use of sodium valproate;</p>  <p>  2. Issuing patient-specific letters to GPs;</p>  <p>  3. Issuing 2500+ letters to patients who were dispensed sodium valproate; </p>  <p>  4. Issuing letters to pharmacies advising them of the patient support service and requesting that they include a patient information leaflet every time they dispense sodium valproate;</p>  <p>  5. Developing an information web page regarding sodium valproate; and</p>  <p>  6. Using social media to provide regular updates to patients and stakeholders.</p>  <p>   In addition to this HSE programme, the HPRA has collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the EMA&rsquo;s new risk minimisation measures in Ireland.</p>  <p>  These measures have included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), as pharmacy regulator, has directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying medicines containing valproate. This includes providing a patient leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p>  <p>  On 22 March, the HSE, together with Epilepsy Ireland and the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome (OACS) Ireland, held a public conference on sodium valproate with the aim of creating awareness for patients who were not included in the communications issued in 2018. Over 300 members of the public registered for this event, which focused on the response to this issue to date by the HSE and the HPRA. </p>  <p>  With regard to diagnostic pathways, the HSE has advised that it has allocated funding for a dedicated Genetics Clinic to be situated in the National Children's Hospital Group. A consultant paediatrician has been appointed, and all paediatric patients referred to date with suspected foetal valproate syndrome (FVS) have been reviewed. The HSE has established a working group to identify the support service needs of patients diagnosed with FVS.     </p>  <p>  The approved product information and Package Leaflet for sodium valproate now includes detailed warnings and recommendations for healthcare professionals and patients regarding use of the drug, including the need for treatment to be initiated and supervised by a specialist experienced in the management of epilepsy or bipolar disorder. New packaging for Epilim products now includes a boxed warning and a pictogram indicating that use of sodium valproate can seriously harm an unborn baby.

There are also restrictions on who can prescribe and administer such devices as some such products are subject to prescription requirements and may only be administered by registered medical doctors or registered dentists. </p>  <p>  Under legislation medical devices must also be CE marked before being placed on the market. The CE mark follows assessment of conformity to the relevant legislative requirements relating to benefit, risk, composition, safety and labelling and also of the manufacturer&rsquo;s production standards. It does not regulate who can use the medical device or practice relating to the use of the device. The new EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU 2017/745), due to be commenced in May 2020, formally includes dermal fillers in Annex XVI within the scope of medical device regulation as devices without a medical purpose (cosmetic).</p>  <p>  The HPRA's regulatory role involves monitoring the safety of medical devices in Ireland after they are placed on the market. The HPRA also operates a national reporting system for medical devices where users of devices are encouraged to report incidents or problems associated with their use to the HPRA. </p>  <p>  Where a significant safety or quality concern is identified with the actual device, there are a range of regulatory actions the HPRA can take to protect public health. These include changes to labelling, information and safety notices to users and recalling the product from the market. They can also request changes or modifications to the device itself. </p>  <p>  Further regulation in this area will be seen following the introduction of The Patient Safety Licensing Bill. The General Scheme of the Bill was approved by Government on 12 December 2017, has completed pre legislative scrutiny, and is currently with the Attorney Generals Office for drafting. The aim of this Bill is to improve patient safety by ensuring that providers of health services do not operate below core standards, which are applied in a consistent and systematic way. Public and private hospitals and providers of high risk healthcare activities taking place outside a hospital setting will require a license to operate. HIQA will be the licensing authority. The non-hospital high risk designated activities will be prescribed by the Minister and the Department is currently working to identify those activities which should be so designated. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has previously recommended that anyone seeking to have a cosmetic  surgery procedure  should seek advice from their General Practitioner (GP) to  ensure that they are a suitable candidate for the procedure in question.  GP&rsquo;s can then recommend a reputable specialist practitioner in this area.</p>  <p>  The Department further recommended a consultation with an appropriately registered plastic surgeon. In  Ireland, such surgeons can be found by examining the online register of medical practitioners found at the website of the Medical Council.  A patient can also establish if a surgeon is a full member of the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons at the website of that organisation; all of its members have had full specialist training and are on the Specialist Register in Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery of the Medical Council. Specific advice, which has been prepared by the Chief Medical Officer and the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons, is also available on the website of my Department.</p></reply>

In this regard I am committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures carried out in the Ophthalmology specialty and is one of the targeted high-volume procedures of the Scheduled Care Access Plan for both 2018 and 2019. </p>  <p>  Waiting List figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for the end of February show the total number of patients waiting for a cataract procedure fell from 10,024 in July 2017 to under 6,300, a reduction of almost 38%. </p>  <p>  The numbers waiting more than 3 months halved in the same period, down from 8,000 to just under 4,000, while those waiting more than 9 months fell from 4,371 to 536, a reduction of 88%.</p>  <p>  Last year also saw the establishment of a dedicated Cataract Centre at Nenagh Hospital. This is a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre facility which, at full capacity, will provide a 5-day service and is expected to deliver approximately 2,000 cataract procedures in 2019. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>   The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient, day case and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume procedures, including cataracts. When combined with HSE activity it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The specified medical conditions (medical indications) are:</p><p>- Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p><p>- Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>- Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>The purpose of the Access Programme is to facilitate access to cannabis-based products or preparations that are of a standardised quality and which meet an acceptable level of quality assurance during the manufacturing process.</p><p><b>Quality Standards for medical cannabis products</b></p><p>The Programme aims to facilitate access to certain &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; cannabis products which have not been authorised as medicines by a statutory Medicines Competent Authority. Such products are not subject to the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that are in place for medicines, nor are the producers subject to the same responsibilities as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. Therefore, whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important to be assured, as far as possible, of the quality standards of these products.  </p><p><b>Access to Medical Cannabis products</b></p><p>Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is critical in establishing the access programme. The Department is aware of only two countries, Canada and the Netherlands, who currently permit commercial export of cannabis products which meet acceptable quality control standards, beyond their borders. The Netherlands permits exports of cannabis dried herb products only, It does not permit commercial export of oil-based cannabis formulations. Canada permits commercial export of all formulations of cannabis products for medical use.  </p><p>Department officials are working intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate products for Irish patients and maintain regular contact with their counterparts in Denmark and Canada. </p><p><b>Ministerial Licence Access Route</b></p><p>Pending full operation of the Access Programme, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients. It is intended that the Ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases only where there is an unmet clinical need.</p><p>While both the Access Programme and the Ministerial licence route might run in parallel initially, it is possible that some of the patients currently using the Ministerial licence route might, where that is possible, be subsumed into the Access Programme, should their treating clinician decide to change their current prescribed cannabis medication to a product that will be provided under the Access Programme. It may not be possible for all the current Ministerial licence holders to transfer immediately; however this will be based on a clinical decision.</p><p><b>Department of Health Website </b></p><p>The Department of Health website contains detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis. It is updated in the event of new developments on the issue.</p></reply>

My Department will continue to work with the NWIHP in 2019 to support ongoing implementation of the Strategy.</p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced. There has also been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years; up from 120 places in 2009 to 193 filled in 2018.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why my Department and the HSE has been engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that agreement has now been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a major package of GP contractual reforms which will benefit patients and GPs.  In return for cooperation with the service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the next four years.  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  There will be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures help make general practice more sustainable and help make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors.</p></reply>

Each inpatient unit has a catchment area covering one or more counties or parts of counties. The number of hospice beds has increased by 44% over the past five years. In addition, every county has a specialist palliative care homecare team. Palliative care is also provided in acute hospitals, community hospitals and through hospice day care services, as well as by GPs and primary care teams. </p>  <p>  There are plans to further increase hospice bed numbers nationwide, ensuring that there is a hospice serving every region of the country, in accordance with national palliative care policy. Three new inpatient units are scheduled to open later this year, in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow. A further three units are planned for development in the coming years, serving people with specialist palliative care needs in counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. Once these inpatient units are opened, there will be hospice coverage for every county in the country. </p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. </p>  <p>   The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018.  I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.</p>  <p>  The priority issues relating to patient care which were raised by women suffering complications and by others on their behalf are addressed in the report recommendations and are being addressed by the HSE. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, were not formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, a number of women whose procedures were postponed wrote to me and my Department expressing concern at the impact that this is having on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.</p>  <p>   The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>    The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p>  <p>  - the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p>  <p>  - surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p>  <p>  - the development of clinical guidance;</p>  <p>  - the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p>  <p>  - ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p>  <p>  - ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>   In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented. </p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.  The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.</p>  <p>  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks. </p>  <p>  At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility also examined in 2014 the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. </p>  <p>  In responding to patients needs, the HSE has implemented revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications. Such measures include the development of a Burden of Illness questionnaire which is used in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's national medical card unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also required to undertake periodic reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide a medical card application system that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. If the HSE is made aware that a person has a particular requirement, whether at application or review stage, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the application. This assistance can be availed of through a person's local health office or by calling LoCall 1890 252 919. </p></reply>

Under the Policy, all children up to 16 years will have available to them eight oral healthcare packages consisting of examinations, assessments (including orthodontic assessments), advice, prevention interventions, emergency care and referral as appropriate. The packages will be provided in a primary care setting by oral healthcare practitioners contracted by the HSE. The Policy supports the development of clinical care pathways to ensure that some aspects of orthodontic care, where appropriate, will be more readily available in a primary dental care practice. Stakeholders including the Dental Council will have an important role in progressing this. </p></reply>

These include acute inpatient services, day hospitals, outpatient clinics, community-based mental health teams (CAMHs, general adult and psychiatry of later life), mental health of intellectual disability, community residential and continuing care residential services. Sub-specialties include rehabilitation and recovery, eating disorders, liaison psychiatry and perinatal mental health. </p>  <p>  In 2018, 114 new Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists were recruited to the HSE Primary Care service, to help relieve pressures on the specialist CAMHS service. Minister Daly recently approved 10 new Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP) posts to improve CAMHS.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to the provision of evidence based Psychological Interventions for young people. These interventions are delivered mainly through Primary Care and where necessary through CAMHS Teams. In addition, significant additional funding has been allocated to Non-Governmental Organisations e.g. Jigsaw to improve access to young people seeking Psychological assistance.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is to authorise public hospitals to offer NTPF-funded treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an acute hospital inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic</p>  <p>  As psychological assessments and CAMHs services are not Inpatient/Daycase or Outpatient waiting lists within an Acute hospital setting, they do not meet current NTPF criteria. </p></reply>

This would help off-set some of the impact of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU fishing vessels in a no-deal scenario. The exact details of how this would work in practice and the funding elements are still under discussion within the EU. Of course, it would be our hope that such measures would not be necessary.</p>  <p>  The second proposal amends the Regulation on the Sustainable Management of the External Fleets. The aim of this proposal is to ensure that the EU is in a position to grant UK vessels access to EU waters until the end of 2019, on the condition that EU vessels are also granted reciprocal access to UK waters. The proposal also provides for a simplified procedure to authorise UK vessels to fish in EU waters and EU vessels to fish in UK waters &ndash; should the UK grant that access. This proposal is limited to 2019 and is based on the agreement in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of 17 and 18 December 2018 on the fishing opportunities for 2019.</p>  <p>  The European Commission are due to report to the Council and the European Parliament on the functioning of the Common Fisheries Policy by 31 December 2022.  It will be up to the European Commission, in accordance with the right of initiative, following such a review to propose possible changes. Ireland will again be a central player in that debate given the importance of fisheries to our coastal communities and I would expect that, in consultation with stakeholders, we will aim to build on the current CFP to ensure an environmentally and economically sustainable seafood industry. </p>  <p>  Any possible changes to the current Policy, and the timing of such proposals, will of course be influenced by the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  In that context, our overriding priority will be to maintain existing reciprocal access to waters and resources.  In terms of the wider CFP, Ireland will be working to continue to improve the long term sustainability of the fish stocks upon which we rely and to ensure ongoing sufficient support for such sustainable development of the seafood sector through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p>  <p>  A disorderly departure, that included a loss of access to UK waters, would have very serious consequence for our seafood industry.  I am satisfied that, in cooperation with our stakeholders and EU partners we are doing all that we can to plan to mitigate the potential impacts. A disorderly Brexit will be about damage limitation not, unfortunately, damage elimination.</p></reply>

Commissioner Hogan confirmed the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and my officials are currently examining options in consultation with the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  The Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 18 March was an important opportunity to highlight to the Council, the Commission and to my fellow Ministers, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the agri-food sector in Ireland and with potential knock-on effects across the EU market as a whole.  During the discussion on the meat market, I outlined the exposure of the Irish beef sector in particular and called for the full suite of measures available under the Common Market Organisation, including targeted support for farmers, to be deployed rapidly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.   I also highlighted the exposure of the Irish fisheries sector, and the need for careful joint EU management of fisheries resources, as well as financial supports for fishermen and their communities.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the CAP legislative proposals are ongoing at EU level.  Since the proposals were launched in June 2018, a significant number of Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian and Romanian Presidencies.  The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis and have, in fact, featured at every SCA meeting under the Romanian Presidency to date.  In addition, the CAP post-2020 is a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting, where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.</p>  <p>  However, there is still some way to go before agreement can be reached on these proposals.  The Romanian Presidency has outlined its ambition to achieve a Partial General Approach on the proposals at its last Agri-Fish Council meeting of Ministers in June.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is working hard with the Commission and the Council in an effort to secure the best possible agreement on the CAP post-2020 proposals.</p></reply>

Therefore, applications under the BEEP Scheme are considered on the basis of the threshold limits set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 i.e &euro;15,000 to a single undertaking over the period of three fiscal years.</p>  <p>  However, this does not mean that farmers who have reached their &euro;15,000 threshold limit since 2017 are precluded from applying under future agriculture de minimis schemes.  In the event that new de minimis schemes are introduced after 14 March 2019, applications for these schemes will be considered on the basis of the new increased threshold limits as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/316.</p></reply>

My role as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is to ensure that the waste management market is operating in compliance with relevant environmental legislation. With regard to the charges applied for kerbside household waste collection, the charges applied should encourage householders to divert waste from the residual or general waste bin. To further encourage this practice, 'flat-rate fees' for household waste collection were phased out over the period October 2017 to October 2018. In other words, the pricing structure that least incentivises diversion of waste from landfill has been phased out. As Minister, I have no role in setting price levels.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established to monitor the rates charged by waste collectors during the phase out of flat-rate fees. It has found that there a number of different pricing models available in the market including various combinations of service charge, charge per bin lift, charge per kilogramme of weight and weight allowance. The PMG has considered data each month since September 2017 and has indicated that, in the vast majority of cases to date, charges have remained stable.

Good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 10.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  In terms of renewable energy, analysis published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in November 2017 projected that we will achieve between 12.7% and 13.9% of our 16% renewable energy target by 2020. This is a huge increase since 2005, when renewable energy was at just 3.1%. </p>  <p>  The Department is exploring the potential mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy targets within the framework of the Directive. Any requirement for statistical transfer purchases will be undertaken against a background of discussions with the EU Commission and relevant Member States. As any purchases arising would be made over a number of years, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of time and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases. </p>  <p>  While contingency planning has commenced in the Department, the focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 renewable targets and on the implementation of existing and new renewable energy measures.</p>  <p>  In securing approval to develop an all of government plan to make Ireland a leader in tackling climate disruption, I made clear that though we had made very substantial progress, we were off target in relation to achieving our renewable energy targets and I said we must step up our ambition in the all of government climate plan. </p>  <p>  The intention is to finalise and publish the whole of Government Climate Action Plan within the next few weeks and this in turn will feed into the National Energy and Climate Plan process, which is due to be finalised and submitted to the Commission in December.</p></reply>

On being appointed as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I said that while Ireland has jointly the most demanding targets (the EU average is 10%), Ireland is far off course.   I am now developing an All-of-Government Plan which will set out the actions to be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change, including how Ireland will, at the very least, meet its targets for the period to 2030. I hope to publish this plan in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC, which put in place binding annual emissions targets for each year between 2013 and 2020 for sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System, Ireland must achieve a reduction of 20% relative to 2005 levels of emissions. The latest projections, published in May 2018 by the EPA, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be only between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020. </p>  <p>The Effort Sharing Decision allows Member States to meet their targets using unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already acquired a portion of the additional allowances that will be required for compliance. However, I am advised that Ireland will need to purchase additional allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. My Department currently estimates the costs of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.  </p></reply>

The Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households that are vulnerable to energy poverty. Energy poverty is a function of a person's income, the price of energy and the energy efficiency of the home. To date, over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the Scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.   Since the Scheme is 100% Exchequer funded, it is designed to be available only to those in most need of Government assistance. To determine this with complete accuracy, the SEAI would need to know the condition of an applicant's home, including its energy efficiency level and heating system, the applicant's family circumstances and their household income level. However, it would not be practical or efficient for the SEAI to perform this assessment for each applicant to the Warmer Homes Scheme. For that reason, eligibility for the Scheme is determined through the use of indicators, principally the National Fuel Allowance. This provides an established mechanism to enable SEAI to find and identify people in energy poverty without having to create and finance a further expensive and intrusive administrative means test type regime. </p>  <p>  The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme is a separate Pilot Scheme which aims to measure the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the energy efficiency of a person&rsquo;s home. The Scheme is being piloted in Community Healthcare Organisation 7. The Scheme is open to people aged 55 and over or aged 12 and under who are living with chronic respiratory conditions in households that are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance or the One-Parent Family Payment. </p>  <p>There are currently no plans to amend the income eligibility criteria for either Scheme.</p></reply>

The outputs from this research note that other studies estimate lower loss rates for both methods of extraction and that more research is required. The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Unconventional gas exploration and extraction (UGEE) Joint Research Programme (2016) cites this paper&rsquo;s author and others also noting that there is a &lsquo;narrow set of primary data&rsquo; to draw on for the emissions over the full life cycles. When considering the full life cycle of the fossil fuels and comparing them, it is also important to look at the full range of impacts such as air, water and land pollution (NOx, Particulate matter, SOx, Ozone, mercury, water quality and disposal of waste residues).   In Ireland the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act 2017 provides for the prohibition of exploration for and extraction of onshore petroleum by means of hydraulic fracturing. However, outside this jurisdiction, the production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas are operational matters for the undertakings involved.</p>  <p>  I am in the process of stepping up Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to switch to renewable sources of energy in the All of Government Action Plan which I am developing. Even under this ambitious plan, natural gas will remain an important part of the transition.</p>  <p>During this transition, natural gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply. Natural gas can also play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels.</p></reply>

I have allocated &euro;105m to these schemes in 2019. An overview of what is available is set out below.The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grants covering up to 30% of the cost of home energy upgrades. The measures covered by this scheme, such as cavity wall, attic insulation, solar thermal, heating controls and a BER certificate, were expanded over the last year to include deeper measures such as external wall insulation and heat pumps. </p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The measures were expanded in 2018 to include internal and external insulation. The eligibility criteria for the scheme were also extended in the last two years to now include families in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. </p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme was launched in 2016 as a pilot initiative under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework. The aim of the scheme, a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health is to demonstrate the effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the occupants&rsquo; health and wellbeing. An independent research project is underway in order to assess the impact of the scheme. Over 1,000 homes at risk of energy poverty have been upgraded to date under the scheme.</p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme was launched in 2017. This scheme offers grant support of up to 50% for homeowners who want to make the leap to upgrade their home to a Building Energy Rating of A and replace fossil fuel heating with a renewable system. The scheme also offers grant support of up to 95% to homeowners in energy poverty. To date, a total of 214 homes have been upgraded under this scheme, including 82 homes at risk of energy poverty. </p><p>The Better Energy Communities Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. It also encourages innovative measures and solutions. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers, and leverage considerable additional private investment. </p><p>Further information on the home energy grants available can be found at <i></i></p><p>The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established in 2016 to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the uptake of lower emitting vehicles. Phase 1 of the work of the Taskforce focused exclusively on electric vehicles. Following on from recommendations made by the Taskforce, a number of generous incentives for electric vehicles were announced as part of Budgets 2018 and 2019. Details of these incentives can be found at the website <i>www.drivingelectric.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The main aim of the Scheme is to validate, in an Irish context, the strong international evidence that making homes warmer, drier and more energy efficient can have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of people living with chronic respiratory conditions. The Scheme is being delivered by a team comprising officials from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and Health Service Executive (HSE). A total of &euro;20m was invested between 2016 and 2018 resulting in upgrades to almost 900 homes. It is expected that 280 houses will be upgraded in 2019. </p>  <p>  The process of evaluating the Scheme is ongoing and is being overseen by a Steering Group comprised of my Department, the Department of Health, SEAI and HSE. Initial reports from the HSE have indicated that the upgrades are delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants. Results from the energy aspects of the Scheme has shown that the average Building Energy Rating of participating homes improved from a D2 to a B3 with carbon emissions reducing by on average 2.2 t CO2/year. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the full interim evaluation of the Scheme being undertaken by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will be completed in Q3 this year with the final evaluation scheduled for completion in 2021.

The project is a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p>  <p>  A total of 16 schools were retrofitted during 2017 and 2018. This resulted in energy savings totalling 1.6 GWh and a CO2 reduction of 334 tonnes. At the local level, reductions in energy usage of 30% were achieved in some buildings with improvements to the learning environment and comfort also realised.</p>  <p>  Lessons from the 2017-18 retrofits have enabled the project approach to be refined for 2019 including the introduction of a clustering model to improve efficiencies. This approach will apply to the 19 schools selected to participate in the initiative for 2019. Schools to be retrofitted for 2020 and subsequent years have not yet been selected. The number of schools that can be accommodated in the programme annually is determined by resourcing capacity available. </p>  <p>  The selection criteria for the Programme are determined by SEAI in consultation with the Department of Education. The current criteria requires that schools: (i) participate in the Energy in Education training programme; (ii) comply with annual Monitoring and Reporting requirements; and (iii) are suitable in terms of building location, age, type, replicability and potential retrofit approaches.</p>  <p>  The Programme will continue to develop and refine approaches to enable the scale up of retrofit works in line with the National Development Plan (NDP) capital funding programme. A total of &euro;2.5bn is identified in the NDP for the refurbishment and construction of schools including a commitment to undertake a &ldquo;deep energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008&rdquo;. The lessons from the Partnership Pathfinder Programme will inform the retrofit approach to be taken on this larger scale. The number of schools to benefit from the Energy Efficiency Programme for Schools as part of the major programme of retrofits scheduled to commence in 2022 will be a matter for the Department of Education.</p></reply>

Local Authorities are responsible for the enforcement of legislation governing litter offences and also waste legislation, including illegal dumping. The Office of Environmental Enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has certain powers, managing environmental regulation, and prosecutions for breaches of licenses issued by them.    An "on-the-spot" fine of &euro;150 may be imposed by local authorities for littering offences. More serious offences may be prosecuted in Court and fines of up to &euro;4,000 and up to &euro;130,000 apply on summary conviction and conviction on indictment respectively. In addition, the fines for continuing littering offences are a maximum of &euro;1,000 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. </p>  <p>  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the Court to pay the Local Authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution, as well as the costs of remediation. Illegal dumping penalties are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a Class A fine (maximum &euro;5,000) on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p></reply>

If a person with the relevant truck or bus category on their UK licence attends at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) Centre without the relevant medical report, they will be given the option to sign a form stating that they do not wish the categories to be exchanged.

For example, in the UK if you passed your test for category B (car) before 1 January 1997, your licence would show entitlement to C1 and C1E (trucks) and D1 and D1E (bus) categories. These categories are given with restrictions identified by codes. </p>  <p>  The C1E category with a restriction code 107 on it entitles the driver to drive a C1E vehicle provided the combined weight of the trailer and the towing vehicle does not exceed 8.25 tonnes/kg. In Ireland the combined weight of the C1E is 12 tonne/kg. Therefore we do not have an equivalent to exchange this category for. The D1 and D1E categories with a restriction code 119 on it only allows the driver to drive a vehicle not for hire or reward. We do not have the corresponding category so cannot exchange it. Code 107 and 119 are UK codes and are not available in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-09a.1357.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040900085#WRBB05100"><p>In recent years, I have secured significantly increased investment in early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC). The annual investment towards high quality, affordable ELC and SAC has risen to &euro;574m, which represents an increase of  117% since 2015.</p>  <p>  The significant increase in supports I announced in April 2017 represented a major step towards accessible, affordable and quality ELC and SAC after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments. These increases reflect my ambition to support quality ELC and SAC services with appropriately supported staff. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government policy to make childcare more affordable, I  introduced new measures in September 2017 (September Measures) aimed at improving access to quality, affordable childcare for families in the interim until the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The September Measures included the universal childcare subvention payment (CCSU) of up to &euro;20 per week for families using eligible childcare providers for the care of children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry to the ECCE scheme.  This non-means tested support amounts to as much as &euro;1,040 per year for children in full-time childcare.  The total number of children who availed of CCSU in the 2017/2018 programme year (between September 2017 and August 2018) was 39,319. Almost two thirds of services (65% or 2,188) that had CCSP contracts, had at least one child registered under CCSU.</p>  <p>  To date 33,410 children have availed of CCSU in the current (2018/2019) year.</p>  <p>  The September Measures also included an average 50% increase to the band rates of the CCS/CCSP targeted schemes.  In 2017/18 36,367 children benefitted from the targeted CCS strands (CCS and CCSP) compared to 24,715 in 2016/17.  This was an increase of 47% on the previous year.  The growth in the number of registrations and participating children is associated directly with the increase investment in the early year&rsquo;s sector.  For the period September 2019 to June 2018 the value of the registrations amounted to &euro;363,691,841.  These increases were considerable and significantly decreased the amount of payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.</p>  <p>  These changes are waypoints towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality ELC and SAC. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which is a new, national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare, will be significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.  NCS will launch this October, with payments flowing from November. The Scheme entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies that will benefit a much greater part of the population, and in particular working families.  It is a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme which will ultimately replace the existing targeted childcare schemes. However, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will not be affected. </p>  <p>  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has already been amended to expand the benefits for working families. As part of Budget 2019, the income threshold levels used for assessing the level of subsidy to which a parent may be entitled were raised. </p>  <p>  The significant increase in the Scheme's maximum net income threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum means that an estimated 7,500 more children will benefit from the scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible, will see increases to their subsidies.</p>  <p>  I am also very pleased that I have managed to adjust the lower income threshold, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (up from &euro;22,700). </p>  <p>  This &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. It will also make work pay for parents in employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.</p></reply>

In other words, increased subsidies may create behavioural changes by families which is not factored into the estimates below, for example, more families than expected may move from unregistered early learning and care services to registered services to avail of the higher level of subsidisation.</p><p>It should also be noted that the increase in the universal subsidy would benefit many children under three years who are in receipt of income-related subsidies.  This is because these children would now all receive a subsidy of at least &euro;1.50 or higher per hour. </p><p><table><tr><th><b>Nov-Dec Cost (2019)</b></th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Universal Rate</td><td>&euro;1.50</td></tr><tr><td>Additional Cost per annum</td><td>&euro;7.17m</td></tr></table><table><tr><th><b>Full year cost (2020)</b></th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Universal Rate</td><td>&euro;1.50</td></tr><tr><td>Additional Cost per annum</td><td>&euro;43m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A first annual report of cross government actions will be compiled in Q3 2019.</p>  <p>  During the first year of implementation my own Department initiated actions to meet the objectives of the Strategy, including immediate provision of new and additional youth service provision to address gaps; a mapping of current LGBTI+ youth service provision at Education and Training Board (ETB) level; funding for 39 organisations across 16 counties for LGBTI+ Capacity Building initiatives and commencing a competition for young people up to the age of 24 to design a sticker for a wide range of organisations and businesses to use to declare their support for diversity, inclusion and visible representation of public support for LGBTI+.  As part of goal 3, to develop research and data environment to better understand the lives of LGBTI+ young people, a tender to commission a landscape analysis of the existing research and data relevant to the Strategy was initiated and is currently under evaluation.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) which included the SCP was transferred to my Department on its establishment in 2011.  Operational responsibility for the SCP was transferred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency on its establishment in 2014.</p>  <p>  Currently, SCP receives annual funding of &euro;24.7 million.  My Department works with the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of Tusla to ensure necessary resources are available to support this programme and to ensure staffing levels are sufficient to deliver a high quality service to those young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p>  <p>  From the Programme&rsquo;s inception under the Department of Education and Skills up to &euro;5,000 per annum was allowed for therapeutic supports for crisis or emergency needs as they arose for SCP participants.  This recognised that many of the SCP participants experience adversity in their lives. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the SCP does not have a responsibility for funding school counsellors and therapeutic services.  The SCP funding for school counsellors and therapeutic services were to be provided only in emergency or crisis cases for SCP participants. </p>  <p>  Tusla (EWS) has advised me that they have reviewed the SCP plans submitted by the SCP project which works in Ladyswell and Corduff National Schools and there is no record of the employment of a school counsellor in plans submitted to Tusla for 2018/19 or in previous years. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with Tusla (EWS) to ensure necessary resources are available to support the SCP programme.  In recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for educational welfare services, including the School Completion Programme, I have requested my officials to establish a Task Group to support the further development and integration of these services.  The work of this group is near completion and I am eager to ensure that output will result in a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the EWS, including the SCP so that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people at risk of early school leaving.</p></reply>

The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p><p>The Actuarial Review calculated the approximate first year cost in 2019.  The table below shows the estimated cost of extending illness and carer's benefits to the self-employed in the first year and the estimated cost in a full year as follows - <table><tr><th></th><th>Illness</th><th>Carer&rsquo;s</th></tr><tr><td>2019 (Full year)</td><td>&euro;54m</td><td>&euro;3m</td></tr><tr><td>1st year </td><td>&euro;43.2m</td><td>&euro;2.4m</td></tr></table></p><p>Latest Departmental estimates show that in the first full year of extension of illness and carer's benefit to the self-employed it is expected that there will be approximately 8,300 extra recipients of illness benefit and 400 extra recipients of carer's benefit at year end.  These estimates assume the same incidence rate of illness/caring as for the general insured population.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Among a wide range of actions, we have increased the frequency and quality of engagement with registered Jobseekers; ensure that &lsquo;work pays&rsquo; when people who are unemployed transition from welfare to employment; facilitate and advance recruitment levels from the Live Register; and operate the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  Participation rates in the Community Employment Schemes in County Kildare is very strong and this offers an important mechanism for jobseekers to gain new skills while gaining valuable work experience assisting them in transitioning into full time employment.  Our activation programme is also enhanced by the contracted services provided by JobPath contractors (Turas Nua) and the Local Employment Service (LES) and Employability in County Kildare.</p>  <p>  While it is difficult to highlight one specific reason for the fall in the live register over the past 12 months, these ongoing collective measures which build on actions from private enterprise, Government Departments and government supported agencies have collectively contributed to the on-going fall in the live register in Kildare.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;256 million on Maternity Benefit. The estimated additional cost of extending the duration of maternity benefit is approximately &euro;9.7 million for each extra week.</p>  <p>  Paternity Leave is paid for 2 weeks and is available for any child born or adopted.  The 2019 Estimates provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;11.7 million for the paternity benefit scheme. The estimated additional cost of extending the duration of paternity benefit is approximately &euro;5.8 million for each extra week above its current 2 week duration at the current weekly rate of &euro;245.  </p>  <p>  There would also be additional costs for employers including substitution and public sector pay costs which would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently announced the introduction of a new paid parental benefit for parents which will support parents to spend additional time with their babies and provide more flexibility in managing a work life balance. This new benefit will be available to parents from November 2019 and will provide for 2 weeks paid leave to each parent of a child, age under 1 year, on parental leave from work. These 2 weeks are additional to that already available under maternity benefit and paternity benefit. </p>  <p>  My Department along with the Department of Justice and Equality, which has lead responsibility for policy in this area, are currently finalising the Draft Heads required to implement this scheme.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

However, as Minister I had made a commitment to seek further funding at an early stage, if necessary, given my belief in the scheme's potential. </p><p>The scheme has been more successful than anticipated, and by the end of January, &euro;106m had been drawn down, accounting for 53% of the available funding, at a point at which &euro;66m would have been more consistent with the expectation of a three year draw down period.  By the end of March, draw downs have reached &euro;127m.</p><p>My officials kept me informed regarding progress on the loan on a regular basis, and have been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since October 2018 when higher lending and drawdown volumes were beginning to materialise.</p><p>I informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January 2019 of the scheme&rsquo;s success and of the need for additional funding, and further indicated that my Department was in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.Local authorities could continue to accept applications as the total funding had not been drawn down.  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform took place on 5 March 2019.</p><p>Ongoing discussions between the three Departments have included consultation with the Central Bank as recently as last Friday, 5<sup>th</sup>April.  When these discussions have concluded, I will be in a position to confirm the level of allocation for 2019.  In the meantime, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications.</p></reply>

This is an evidence-based process that takes account of labour market conditions and submissions from sectors and other stakeholders, together with contextual factors such as Brexit. The purpose of the system is to maximise the benefits of economic migration, while minimising the risk of disrupting the Irish labour market.</p><p>Following a comprehensive cross-departmental/agency review earlier this year, in which my Department was involved, the following changes, which address skills shortages in the construction area, were announced by my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, on 3 April 2019:</p><p><b>Addition of certain occupations to the Critical Skills List of Occupations:</b></p><p>- Civil engineers</p><p>- Quantity surveyors</p><p>- Construction project managers</p><p>- Mechanical and electrical engineers with BIM capabilities</p><p><b>Removal of certain occupations from the Ineligible List of Occupations:</b></p><p>- Sheet metal workers</p><p>- Welding trades </p><p>- Pipefitters</p><p>- Air-Conditioning &amp;amp; Refrigeration Engineers  </p><p>- Shuttering Carpenters </p><p>- Glaziers, window fabricators &amp;amp; fitters </p><p>- Scaffolders, stagers &amp;amp; riggers </p><p>- Crane drivers</p><p><b>Removal of the certain occupations from the Ineligible List of Occupations by quota: </b></p><p>- Transport and Distribution Clerks and Assistants (Freight Forwarders; Cargo &amp;amp; Freight Agents; Brokerage Clerks) subject to a quota of 300, </p><p>- Plasterers subject to a quota of 250</p><p>- Bricklayers subject to a quota of 250 </p><p>As construction in the residential sector increases, it is important that the sector has access to the right mix of skills &amp;amp; labour.

These are Cork County Council, Fingal County Council, Meath County Council, Wicklow County Council and Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council.</p>  <p>  My officials kept me informed regarding progress on the loan on a regular basis, and have been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since October 2018 when higher lending and drawdown volumes were beginning to materialise.</p>  <p>  I informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January 2019 of the scheme&rsquo;s success and of the need for additional funding, and further indicated that my Department was in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.  Local authorities could continue to accept applications as the total funding had not been drawn down.  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform took place on 5 March 2019.</p>  <p>  Ongoing discussions between the three Departments have included consultation with the Central Bank as recently as last Friday, 5 April.  When these discussions have concluded, I will be in a position to confirm the level of allocation for 2019.  In the meantime, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications.</p></reply>

The report does not disaggregate the position of low income market renters. However, my Department&rsquo;s own research does and indicates that in 2016 households in the market rental sector in the lowest 25% of the income distribution typically paid 40% of their disposable income on housing costs.</p><p>Ultimately, the most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term, with benefits for the entire sector, is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors.</p><p>The policy recommendations made by the EU Urban Agenda Housing Partnership, and echoed by Social Justice Ireland in its Spring 2019 publication, are largely in line with my Department&rsquo;s policies, such as to increase the supply of social and affordable housing, tackle vacancy and voids, and invest in affordable housing across tenures, including cost rental. </p><p>The ongoing efforts by my Department, relevant agencies, local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and other stakeholders to deliver on the goals of Rebuilding Ireland is bearing fruit, but we will not become complacent and will continue to work together to tackle the issue of housing supply.  </p><p>The Government's Strategy for the Rental Sector outlines a range of measures for a viable and sustainable rental sector, structured around four key areas: security, supply, standards and services. </p><p>Arising from the publication of the Strategy, a number of targeted measures and initiatives were announced with the aim of providing better security of tenure, higher accommodation standards and greater rent certainty for tenants, as well as enhancing the supports and services available to landlords to facilitate the development of a more vibrant and sustainable rental sector.  </p><p>The initiatives which have since been implemented include the introduction of the Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising resulting in great difficulty for households finding affordable accommodation.  In Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually. The measure applies to new and existing tenancies, when rents are set at the start of a tenancy and when rents are set in a rent review during an ongoing tenancy or new tenancy, unless otherwise exempted.</p><p>The RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases.</p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at <i></i>, by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.</p></reply>

Over &euro;128 million of exchequer support has been provided for this work to end-2018, which has improved the energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 68,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction and energy reduction targets. An annual breakdown of the funding provided is set out in the Table.</p><p>The retrofitting programme is being implemented in a number of phases; Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties, while Phase 2 will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction and will also include the provision of heating upgrades. The maximum grant available under Phase 1 was &euro;3,500 per property, while the maximum grant available under Phase 2 will be &euro;22,800 per property. </p><p>For 2019, the programme has an allocated exchequer budget of &euro;25 million. My Department has requested all local authorities to submit proposed programmes of activity for the year and those received so far are now being assessed in terms of an equitable allocation to all local authorities within the exchequer funding available.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Funding drawn down</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;26,951,705</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;30,723,748</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;26,903,781</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;22,532,835</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;8,665,268</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;12,942,633</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Dublin City Council's Fire Service received an allocation for three new &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances, which is the standard appliance. In 2015, under a similar programme, Dublin's Fire Service also received an allocation for three new &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances. Dublin City Council's Fire Service requested, and received approval, to substitute the cost of one of the appliances to purchase a pre-used turntable ladder. In addition to these allocations, since 2008, my Department has also funded four &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances and one turntable ladder for Dublin.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the age, number and vehicle type of the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet, as requested by the Deputy, is not available in my Department. It should be available directly from the Fire Authority, in this instance Dublin City Council who, through Dublin Fire Brigade, provide fire services for all four Dublin local authorities.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review, on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

More than 50,000 social housing homes will be delivered by the end of 2021. These new homes will be delivered by both local authorities themselves and working in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).</p><p>In the interest of transparency and accountability and to facilitate continued solution focused dialogue, my Department publishes quarterly reports outlining progress against the plan. Insofar as local authority and AHB construction projects are concerned, the quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Reports contain information regarding the stage of progress of each project and the number of homes involved, broken down by local authority. The most recent report, setting out the position at end 2018, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website and can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-publishes-social-housing-construction-status-report-for-q4-2018/.</i></p><p><i></i>Last year, 4,251 new homes were brought into the active social housing stock through new build projects, with a further 4,171 brought into productive use through other mechanisms such as acquisitions, voids and leasing programmes.  The new build delivery in 2018 represented an 85% increase on the previous year.  Indeed, the number of new social housing homes built in 2018 was eight times greater than the number built in 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was introduced.  38% of these homes were delivered by AHBs in partnership with local authorities.</p><p>My Department sets national and county targets on an annual basis and works closely with all stakeholders, including AHBs, to facilitate accelerated delivery. Responsibility for delivery of targets is delegated to local authorities in order to enable flexibility and responsiveness to new opportunities to further expand pipelines. Therefore, while my Department publishes targets for each year and quarterly updates on progress against these targets, due to many project and external factors, definitive completion dates can be difficult to project.  However, my Department works with local authorities and AHBs on an ongoing basis to ensure that all social housing projects are delivered as efficiently as possible.</p></reply>

In addition to local authorities building on their own land, partnerships with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are also an important aspect of build delivery.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland has been increasing the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver social housing over the past three years and clear results are being delivered.  This is evident in the fact that there was an 85% increase in new build social homes in 2018 when compared to 2017 (excluding voids) and the number of new social housing homes built in 2018 was eight times greater than the number built in 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was initiated.</p><p>My Department supports delivery through the development and implementation of policy and legislation geared towards enhanced supply and also through the provision of significant funding for local authorities. In addition, my Department works closely with each individual local authority to support them to deliver their minimum build targets, and where possible to exceed their targets and advance their pipelines for additional delivery in the coming years. The quarterly Construction Status Reports which I publish provide an overview of all new build social housing completed and being advanced across the 31 local authorities.  The latest report, which sets out the position at end 2018, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>In order to deliver effectively and efficiently, local authorities and approved housing bodies are using a combination of the rapid build framework, turnkey opportunities, and through traditional construction methods.</p><p>The coming three years will see further increased output of social housing throughout the country and I have recently written to each local authority outlining ambitious targets for 2019. These targets can be viewed at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>In 2019, funding of &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for the delivery of housing programmes, which will allow for the housing needs of almost 27,400 additional households to be met. 10,000 of these will be provided through build, acquisition and lease programmes.</p><p>I am confident that progress remains on track to meet the target to deliver 50,000 new homes over the 6 years 2016-2021.</p></reply>

At that time the scheme proposed to supply over 800 houses plus farms and commercial premises to a relatively large area of north-west County Kildare &ndash; covering some 4 to 5% of the area of the county.</p>  <p>  The scheme, the size of a medium sized public water supply scheme, would be very large by group water scheme standards. Accordingly, it was included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 for public schemes. There was little progress on the project over the next number of years and it was not included in my Department&rsquo;s subsequent Water Services Investment Programme for the period 2010&ndash;2013.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water, as a single national utility, is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.</p>  <p>  I understand that Kildare County Council and Irish Water met with the scheme in 2015. It became clear at the meeting that there is little prospect of the source of supply for the scheme being included in the Irish Water Capital Investment Programme. I understand that alternatives were also considered but ruled out because they were not technically feasible. Therefore, the scheme would not be able to proceed either in the short or medium term and the promoters of the scheme were informed accordingly by Irish Water. I understand that soon after the 2015 meeting the scheme decided to wind up.</p>  <p>  Acknowledging that costs were incurred in development work on the scheme, my Department agreed to recoup an amount of some &euro;79,000 to assist in meeting these costs. Kildare County Council was advised of this position in November 2018 and were recouped the sum earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Given the nature of the scheme as set out above, Kildare County Council did not submit a bid for the scheme under the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme announced earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Households in the area of the scheme have other alternatives to improve their domestic water supply, if necessary. The Individual Wells Grant under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme can be accessed through Kildare County Council, to assist with the provision or necessary improvement of an individual water supply to households.</p></reply>

As set out in my reply of 12 March 2019, all capital grants exceeding &euro;300,000 require a legal charge on the property being developed for the amount of the grant for a period of 15 years. This charge is to protect the taxpayer's investment in the property if it was to undergo a change of use or in the event of its sale.</p>  <p>  The Chief State Solicitors Office (CSSO) is seeking to complete the legal formalities in order that the grant can be paid to the theatre to which the Deputy refers. The CSSO has been in negotiations with both the solicitors representing the theatre and the theatre's landlord for some time now and work has progressed significantly in the last three months. At this point, the necessary Deed of Agreement has been agreed by the relevant parties and is ready to be signed and sealed by both parties. The CSSO in conjunction with the grantee's solicitors will then ensure that all the relevant legal searches are in order. The grantees solicitors must then lodge the charge in the Companies Registration Office within 21 days from date of these search results. On completion of the legal formalities which should take no more than one month, it is hoped that the theatre can then make progress on the project.</p></reply>

The Declarations to implement these derogations are renewed annually and an annual review of the Declarations is undertaken prior to their expiry.</p><p>The 2017 review took into account the issue of seagulls in the North Dublin area especially in Balbriggan which had been the subject of correspondence to my Department from some community groups and other residents which proposed the inclusion of seagull species in the Declaration.</p><p>Following consideration of the matter, the Declaration, which was effective from 1 May 2017 to 30 April 2018, included methods to control seagull species in the Balbriggan area for public safety reasons.  The control method involved the removal of eggs and nests only and the culling of seagulls was not permitted.  Similar provision was made in the Declaration effective from 1 May 2018 to 30 April 2019.</p><p>My Department undertook a review of the derogation process under Article 9 of the EU Birds Directive which took account of all relevant factors, including perceived threats, distribution and population data available in respect of all the bird species in the derogations.

The final report of the consultants was published in October last year and is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at <i>www.npws.ie.</i></p><p>One of the recommendations of the consultant&rsquo;s report was the setting up of a group to agree a programme of action in relation to the seagull situation in the certain urban areas.

Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  The building mentioned by the Deputy is in the ownership and management of the local authority, and is, in the first instance a matter for it. It is recorded in my Department&rsquo;s National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and is rated there as of Regional Importance. As such it was recommended to the local authority for inclusion in its Record of Protected Structures.</p>  <p>  As the owner of this protected structure, the local authority has a duty under the Acts to ensure the structure does not become endangered. I am informed that there is considerable work underway at present in advance of conducting an analysis of its structural integrity. The Council have informed my Department that no decision in relation to the future of the structure can be made until this assessment is completed.</p>  <p>  In terms of the support that my Department can offer, my role in relation to protected structures is mainly advisory. My officials remain available to advise the County Council in its efforts to manage the building and see it returned to a sustainable use that is consistent with its significant history and position in the town.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS), which are administered by local authorities. On Thursday 28 March, I announced funding of &euro;4.3 m for 478 projects under these schemes in 2019. Details of these projects and the funding are available on my Department's website and local authority websites. I understand, however, that the scale of investment needed for the structure mentioned would mean that the levels of grant funding available under these schemes would not be sufficient.</p>  <p>  I fully understand and appreciate the value of our built heritage at a local level and I have asked officials in my Department to arrange to meet with the  Deputy, along with Monaghan County Council, to discuss the location in question.</p></reply>
