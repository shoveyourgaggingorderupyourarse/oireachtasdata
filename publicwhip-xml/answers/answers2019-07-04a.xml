    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-04a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070400053#WRA00600"><p>I welcome the publication of the Engineers Ireland review of housing and infrastructure in Ireland. This report includes recommendations on a range of issues related to the housing stock, including the development and implementation of a national renovation strategy.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Report, the recently published Climate Action Plan sets a target of retrofitting 500,000 houses to BER B2, cost optimal equivalent or carbon equivalent by 2030. This will help us to meet our 2030 targets for emissions reductions. Achieving our 2050 targets will require a further step up and many more houses will have to be retrofitted in the decades to come. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 has provided &euro;3bn for the period to 2027 to support the achievement of the 2030 target. While this is clearly a substantial amount of Government financial support, Exchequer funding alone will not be enough to meet the level of activity required. In this regard, the Plan commits to providing easier access to tailored finance for residential energy efficiency investment in addition to optimising Government funding and grant schemes. </p>  <p>  The Plan also incorporates a range of other measures that will be used to achieve this target. This includes the development and implementation of a new delivery model that groups retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods. This area-based approach will seek to capitalise on critical mass, leveraging economies of scale that will benefit both householders and the supply chain. The savings on electricity bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer and produce fewer emissions.</p></reply>

The primary objectives of the National Dialogue are to engage and empower citizens and communities to take local action, to ensure an inclusive progress of engagement and feedback, and to develop the capacity for individuals and communities to act and bring about the transformation of our society to a low carbon and climate-resilient future.</p>  <p>  A range of initiatives are taking place under the National Dialogue, which is being delivered by my Department and the EPA. These include regional gatherings, a climate action and awareness programme delivered by Green Schools, a special Tidy Towns Air Quality and Climate award, a climate lecture series delivered by the EPA, and support for the development of online and broadcast media content.</p>  <p>  Two regional gatherings have taken place to date, in Athlone in June 2018 and in Tralee in November 2018. These were free, professionally facilitated workshop-style events, which sought to explore the specific challenges and opportunities involved in moving Ireland to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society in the regions concerned. Further details of each event, including a facilitator&rsquo;s summary, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. I intend that further regional gatherings take place later in 2019, with a view to ensuring an even geographical spread of events throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, published last month, envisages that the National Dialogue on Climate Action will be further developed as a model of citizen engagement, deliberation and action on climate change, building on the process employed by the Citizens' Assembly. In particular, the National Dialogue has potential to drive action at community level, through harnessing existing networks and helping to build new ones, supporting better communication, and providing more focused deliberation leading to effective action. </p>  <p>  As part of this wider dialogue, I am separately undertaking a series of nationwide consultative meetings, to explain the approach, hear views and take on ideas from members of the public on the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The first of these events took place in University College Cork on 21 June and a second event will take place this coming Friday in Thurles, County Tipperary. This is a free event, which is open to members of the public, and details of the event have been advertised in local media. Further meetings are being planned for Galway, the Midlands, Dublin and Donegal before the end of July.</p></reply>

The scheme is delivered through a panel of contractors, appointed through a competitive tendering process. There are currently 39 contractors on the panel.Works that are completed must be audited and in some cases further inspected before SEAI can request an invoice and make a payment to the contractor. Audits are carried out by a managing agent on behalf of the SEAI. </p><p>The SEAI have informed my officials that they are aware that delays in the auditing process are currently being experienced. This is due to:</p><p>- the increased volume of homes being completed; </p><p>- the fact that many of these homes have had deeper measures implemented which require a greater depth of audit examination given the public monies involved; and </p><p>- some capacity constraints in the managing agent that carries out the audits. </p><p>The SEAI are working to address these delays. Steps taken to date include:</p><p>- introducing additional temporary resources to help manage the immediate issue; </p><p>- increased monitoring and reporting on the status of homes to be audited; </p><p>- working with the managing agent to increase their delivery speed and ensure that the homes that have been waiting the longest are audited first; </p><p>- ensuring that auditing resources are balanced across all 39 contractors to ensure that no contractor is experiencing longer wait times than others; and </p><p>- an increase in the frequency in which SEAI make payments to contractors has been implemented.</p><p>The SEAI is aware of the importance of prompt payment consistent with ensuring public monies are properly expended, and ensuring wait times for contractors are to the greatest extent possible minimised. If the measures implemented to date do not result in the required improvement in turnaround-time, further steps will be taken within the limits of the SEAI&rsquo;s governance requirements and an affordable Service Level Agreement with the managing agent.</p></reply>

The RESS has been designed within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework and the scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of 70% by 2030. </p>  <p>  Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix. Globally, the costs of renewable technologies are falling rapidly with solar PV showing the most rapid decrease in prices in recent years. </p>  <p>  I am targeting the delivery of indicative volumes of up to 1.5 GW of grid scale solar by 2030. Grid scale solar energy farms will be critical to diversifying the renewable technology mix and to deliver gains through connecting hybrid renewable technologies. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the RESS auctions will set out the process by which all competing technologies including grid scale solar farms connect and receive support for supplying energy to the national grid. The first RESS auction is expected to open for applications in late 2019. In addition corporate power purchase agreements will provide a route to market for solar PV and will be key to meeting our 70% RES-E target.</p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>  <p>  The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. </p>  <p>  A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.</p>  <p>  In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:</p>  <p>  - public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040 </p>  <p>  - measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices </p>  <p>  - new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities) </p>  <p>  - actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions.</p>  <p>  For the first time, a decarbonisation target has been set for each sector. Each Government Department must now determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The exact costs will be determined from the detailed policy design work which will consist of a mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector.</p>  <p>  There would be a very significant costs to the Exchequer from not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would not only lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run but would require significant compliance costs to meet our legally binding EU targets. This could result in a cost to the Exchequer of up to &euro;1.75 billion over the next decade. Full implementation of the Climate Action Plan would mean that Ireland would avoid incurring such costs.</p></reply>

The objective is that a support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators by 2021. ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will assess potential implications for the distribution network of higher penetrations of micro-generation by the end of 2019. My Department will establish a working group which will set policy objectives which will in turn lead to the detailed design of the support scheme. </p>  <p>  Micro generation was also appraised as part of the economic assessment for the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  The pilot scheme launched last year and administered by the SEAI is being reviewed and the costs of installation being assessed. The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable communities and self-consumers.</p></reply>

This will bring significant benefits including in areas such as e-Health, e-Education, smart farming, regional development and tourism. </p>  <p>  The NBP aims to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland has access to high speed broadband. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Preferred Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  This plan will ensure that rural Ireland will have the same opportunities as urban Ireland. Digital participation helps small and medium businesses to compete successfully on a global scale, accessing more customers and enabling businesses to streamline their efficiencies to provide for cloud computing, back-up and recovery and e-commerce services. </p>  <p>  In addition, the provision of high speed broadband in rural Ireland is of critical importance in areas such as flexible and remote working. Remote or home-working is becoming an increasingly prevalent employment model, including amongst overseas firms that continue to invest in Ireland. This area of the economy is projected to double over the next 5 years. It will also afford national and international employers better access to a wider catchment of skilled workers, even where offices and businesses are located within more rural areas.</p>  <p>  The efficient and timely provision of a high speed broadband network across Ireland will also enable agricultural businesses to move into smarter farming which will increase output while reducing administrative costs. Smart farming can improve Ireland's competitiveness on the international scale through efficiencies delivered via remote monitoring of livestock, increased crop output, data driven crop and herd management and enabling quality software that supports efficient farm management and profitability.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan highlights the importance of remote working opportunities to regenerate, revitalise and re-establish regional and rural Ireland as an attractive place to live and work. In turn this will help bridge the rural\urban divide and create equality of employment opportunity across Ireland.</p></reply>

While emissions from the sector were on a downward trend between 2005 and 2011, they have stayed relatively static since, as a result of rising demand for power outstripping our increased generation from renewable sources. Nevertheless in 2017 the use of renewables in electricity generation reduced CO<sub>2</sub>emissions by 3.3 Mt and avoided &euro;278 million in fossil fuel imports. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimate displacement of emissions through the use of renewable energy in electricity generation in the Energy in Ireland 2018 report (section 3.1.4). The methodology used is detailed in the 2019 &ndash; see appendix 2. The 2019 report is based on previous research by SEAI titled <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012 </i>which compare electricity generation without the use of renewables with the actual outcome in 2012 when renewables were in use. This analysis shows real and substantial emissions reductions resulting from the use of renewables. </p><p>In the recently launched Climate Action Plan, I have set out a target of reducing CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from the electricity to 4-5 Mt in 2030.</p><p>Reaching a 70% share of renewable electricity would require 50-55% emissions reduction by 2030 relative to pre-NDP 2030 projections, as set out in Chapter 7 of the Plan.</p></reply>

Under the National Adaptation Framework, each Local Authority is required to develop a Local Adaptation Strategy in line with &ldquo;Local Authority Adaptation Strategy Development Guidelines,&rdquo; which were launched by Minister of State Canney on 3 December 2018 and are available on www.dccae.gov.ie. Local Authorities have been set a deadline for the completion of local strategies by 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, my Department also entered into a funding commitment of &euro;10 million over 5 years to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices. This recognises the significant obligation which has been placed on local government to develop and implement its own climate action measures - both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.</p>  <p>  A key priority for the Climate Action Regional Offices in 2019 will be to support the Local Authorities within their region to develop their Local Adaptation Strategies and ensure they align with national adaptation policy and sectoral priorities. Work is underway across all Local Authorities on the preparation of Local Adaptation Strategies in line with the five-step methodology set out in the Guidelines, and with a view to meeting the 30 September deadline. The development and approval of the strategies themselves remains the responsibility of each individual Local Authority.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with local government in supporting the adaptation planning process and will monitor overall progress on the development of Local Adaptation Strategies at Local Authority level via the National Adaptation Steering Committee, as well as through the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2019.</p></reply>

A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic wellbeing and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. Greater inter-connection is also necessary if we are to ensure 70% of electricity is renewable by 2030.</p>  <p>  In December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. In Ireland a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019. </p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018. </p>  <p>  There are currently a number of on-going procurements in relation to the project being undertaken and managed by ESB Networks. In June 2019 ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork in relation to the project. However under this framework there will be no supply of materials until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete.</p>  <p>  The earliest possible date for construction to commence is early 2020.</p></reply>

While data centres have until recently accounted for less than 2% of Ireland&rsquo;s total electricity demand, EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2018-2027, project that demand from data centres could account for 31% of all demand by 2027.  Data centres consume very large amounts of energy and have a flat, predictable demand profile meaning that they use the same amount of electricity throughout the day and night and therefore require a range of generation technologies to meet their demand. Given the quantum of electricity required to power data centres, it is important that renewable projects are developed to meet the demand for additional renewable electricity generation and the costs of this are minimised for consumers. The Government Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy, 2018 recognises that a plan-led approach is needed to develop a range of measures to promote regional options for data centre investment, minimising the need for additional grid infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Significant increases in volumes of generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s increasing electricity demand including from data centres. The recently launched Climate Action Plan sets out a number of actions to ensure that data centres are accommodated in a sustainable manner. Corporate power purchasing of renewable energy by large energy users such as data centres will be critical to supplying data centre demand as will ensuring that large demand connections are regionally balanced to minimise grid reinforcements.</p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have a great window of opportunity to reverse this trend and secure a healthy more resilient future for the country, It means changing the way we heat our homes, the way we travel and the way we power the country.</p>  <p>  The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. </p>  <p>  A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.</p>  <p>  In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:</p>  <p>  - public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040 </p>  <p>  - measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices</p>  <p>  - new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities) </p>  <p>  - actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions.</p>  <p>  For the first time, a decarbonisation target has been set for each sector. Each Government Department must now determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The exact costs will be determined from the detailed policy design work which will consist of a mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there would also be a very significant cost to the Exchequer for not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would also lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run.</p>  <p>  Failure to implement these policies to meet our legally binding EU targets could result in a cost to the Exchequer of up to &euro;1.75 billion over the next decade as well as locking Ireland into a future high carbon trajectory.</p>  <p>  In relation to the costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets for the period 2013 to 2020 under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD), my Department currently estimates the additional costs to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. This is in addition to a total of &euro;120 million that has already been spent as part of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012), arising from which approximately 5,500,000 carbon credits are currently held by the State, which may be used for ESD compliance.</p></reply>

On 12 June 2019, the EU published its Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. The Directive aims to deal with the top ten single use plastic items that cause 70% of marine litter. Ireland supported the ambition throughout negotiations and I am committed to transposing this Directive as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Work has already commenced on delivering key elements of the Directive. I have commissioned a national study into how we can deliver a 90% collection target for single use plastic drinks bottles in Ireland. The EPA has begun consultation with stakeholders in relation to the new reporting requirements contained in the Directive. My officials are commencing consultation with the industries to which new Extended Producer Responsibility obligations will apply. My Department are also considering measures for the reduction in consumption of single use plastic food containers and cups for beverages. The Government has also decided that Government Departments would not purchase single-use plastic cups, cutlery and drinking straws from 1 January 2019; this decision was extended to all public bodies and commercial state agencies under the aegis of Ministers with effect from 1 April 2019.</p></reply>

The Government considered two ownership models, having narrowed the options from five models. While this decision was informed by a high level cost modelling on both options, the NBP procurement was always structured so that the final cost would be determined through the dialogue process with bidders. At the point of the Government decision on the ownership model a number of factors were considered. Among these was the estimation that the gap funded model was likely to lead to a lower cost than the full concession model because of the strategic value bidders would place on the network and the incentive to continue investment and upgrade over the full 25 years of the contract and beyond.</p></reply>

A cornerstone of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) will be the provision of pathways for increased community ownership, participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects. The scheme will deliver capacity building supports for community-led projects, including financial, technical and legal assistance, along with community benefit obligations, for projects looking for support under RESS. The high level design mandates a Community Benefit Fund and Register standardised across the sector. The Community Benefit contribution is set at &euro;2/MWh for all RES-E generation produced and seeking support via RESS auctions.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing RESS detailed design work, which has included further engagement with community energy groups, my officials are exploring a variety of options to facilitate community-led projects within the first auction. My officials will continue to explore these options as the detailed design of RESS is progressed. </p>  <p>  The implementation of RESS and the suite of measures for community participation are a key action in the recently published Climate Action Plan. The RESS scheme is one of the steps towards increasing the level of clean, renewable energy in Ireland and to mobilise local and community involvement in renewable energy projects</p>  <p>  The final design of the scheme will be subject to state aid clearance from the EU Commission.</p>  <p>Under the current planning framework, renewable energy project developers are required to make contributions to the Local Authority Community Fund. In addition, the wind industry has committed to contributing to community benefit funds established under my Department&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Wind Energy Development in Ireland - Guidelines for Community Engagement. In parallel with the new Community Framework to be delivered under the RESS, it is expected that projects delivered under corporate power purchase agreements will make community benefit contributions in line with the Guidelines, as well as meeting strengthened provisions for community benefit to be set out in the revised Wind Energy Guidelines.</p></reply>

However, I have been advised that Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s BioEnergy division sources sustainable biomass used at the Edenderry power station and that up to 80% of the biomass used in the plant is from domestic sources. However, in the event that all three of the electricity generating plants referred to co-fire peat with biomass, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient amounts of indigenous biomass to meet the demand. In addition to the three power stations, there is demand for biomass for use in industry and in residential heating, and the Government&rsquo;s Support Scheme for Renewable Heat will also create a demand for biomass supplies in the coming years. Therefore international sources of biomass will be required. </p>  <p>  Use of appropriate sustainability criteria will help to ensure that use of biomass does not have a detrimental effect on the world&rsquo;s forests. EU-wide sustainability criteria have been introduced in the revised Renewable Energy Directive, which includes provisions to ensure that energy biomass will be required to emit significantly less carbon than the fossil fuel equivalent. This Directive excludes certain types of biomass from contributing to a member state&rsquo;s renewable energy performance such as biomass from areas of high biodiversity, areas designated for nature protection purposes and areas designated for protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised Bord na Mona sources sustainable biomass used at the Edenderry station, based on a set of sustainability principles, aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

Representatives of civil society, such as the organisation to which the Deputy refers, may attend meetings of the UNFCCC as observers to the negotiation process. While I have not engaged directly with this particular organisation, Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the UNFCCC regularly meets representatives of civil society, in particular organisations from Ireland, that attend the annual Conference of the Parties. </p>  <p>  I note that the report, published by the organisation referred to, shares the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5⁰C, published in October 2018, on the urgency of ambitious action to tackle the challenges of climate change. Addressing climate change, whether through decarbonisation of our economy, or preparing to adapt to the impacts of climate change such as through low-risk land-sector approaches as highlighted in the report, is one of the most significant challenges of this century. The IPCC, through its reports, has confirmed the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.</p>  <p>  I recently published the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2019, which puts Ireland on a trajectory to meet our 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions, and puts us on a pathway to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to becoming a leader in responding to climate change and to supporting increased climate ambition at national, EU and international levels.</p>  <p>  As land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets from 2021, it is essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories. The Climate Action Plan, therefore, includes 34 individual actions to facilitate the development and implementation of policies to manage emissions and enhance removals from the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use sectors. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, which was published earlier this year by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, also includes climate action as a core priority. By supporting solutions for those most affected by climate change, the new policy will seek to ensure the Ireland continues to champion the needs of those most vulnerable to climate change, especially those in the least developed and small islands states.</p></reply>

Given the contribution of agriculture to overall national greenhouse gas emissions, achieving this objective will be a significant challenge facing Irish agriculture over the coming decades. In this context, the Plan separately commits to evaluating the changes which would be necessary in Ireland to achieve a net zero emissions target by 2050.</p>  <p>  In the context of the period to 2030, the Plan commits the sector to delivering 16.5 - 18.5 Mt CO2 eq. cumulative abatement from agriculture as well as achieving 26.8 Mt CO2 eq abatement through Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Actions over the period 2021 to 2030. To achieve these targets, the Plan sets out a range of actions to reduce emissions on farms, promote afforestation and diversification of land use, develop opportunities in the bio-economy and in the supply of substitutes for fossil fuels, promote better management of peatlands and soils, and develop clusters of best practice.</p>  <p>  Implementation of these actions will, collectively, help to further underpin the environmental credentials of the Irish agriculture sector and better position it to meet the evolving expectations of both domestic and international markets. This, in turn, will help prepare the sector for longer-term restructuring and adaptation that will be required to meet our carbon neutrality objectives.</p></reply>

While housing and housing standards are issues that fall under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, a number of recommendations do have relevance for programmes and initiatives on which my department leads.  Improving the energy efficiency of a home, in line with NSAI standards for retrofitting, can help to combat the problems associated with damp housing such as mould and rot. Upgrading the insulation of a damp house can also have significant benefits for the indoor air quality and health of the occupants. </p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of grant schemes to help people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Work carried out under these schemes must meet NSAI standards and be carried out by an SEAI registered contractor. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working to improve the energy efficiency of our rental sector. These homes are more likely to be less energy efficient than owner occupied homes, and therefore more prone to the types of issues highlighted by the Deputy. A cross Departmental Advisory Group has been established to examine potential policy options and make recommendations to Government. A public consultation on this matter is currently in development and will be published later in 2019.</p>  <p>  While I understand the report considers connectivity in a broad sense, in relation to broadband connectivity, the Government decision on 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. </p><p>The Plan represents a significant step-up in ambition, with a target abatement range for each of the key sectors that contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions: Electricity, Enterprise, Built Environment, Transport, Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use, Waste and the Circular Economy, and the Public Sector. The analysis set out in the Plan shows that it is not only technically feasible to meet our 2030 EU targets, but that it is also economically achievable, with the majority of necessary abatement measures being, over their life-time, either cost-neutral or resulting in net savings to society. </p><p>The Plan also sets out new governance arrangements that will be put in place to provide effective oversight of implementation of the Plan, and which also align with the relevant recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action. </p><p>These include:</p><p>- a Climate Action Delivery Board jointly chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, holding individual Departments and agencies to account</p><p>- the publication of a quarterly report on the implementation of actions set out in the Plan </p><p>- a statutory basis for establishing carbon budgets with clear sectoral targets</p><p>- a strengthened Climate Action Council</p><p>- a strengthened Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action to hold the Government to account on the implementation of climate policy</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2019 also proposes enhanced engagement with citizens and communities through more coherent mobilisation of existing structures and initiatives to inform, engage, motivate, and empower individuals and communities to take climate action. The Plan recognises that individuals and communities will be at the heart of the low-carbon transition, and will seek to promote positive choices that will ultimately bring long-term benefits to communities across Ireland. </p><p>Furthermore, recognising that the pace of technological, scientific, societal and economic changes, the Plan will be updated every 12 months, underpinned by consultation with key stakeholders. </p><p>In this context, I am currently undertaking a series of nationwide consultative meetings, to explain the approach, hear views and take on ideas from members of the public on the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The first of these events took place in University College Cork on 21 June and a second event will take place this coming Friday in Thurles, County Tipperary. Further meetings are being planned for Galway, the Midlands, Dublin and Donegal before the end of July.</p></reply>

I believe that a strong and stable democracy cannot flourish without full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of assembly, association and expression. Ireland actively works to promote and protect the right to these freedoms in the relevant international fora. </p>  <p>  At the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is currently ongoing in Geneva, the EU issued a statement on Human Rights situations that require the Council's attention. Among other issues, the statement refers to the situation in Egypt, recalling the importance of the respect of freedom of expression, media, assembly and association and the need to stop unduly restricting space for civil society, including through arrests and long periods of pre-trial detention.</p>  <p>  The EU and Egypt adopted partnership priorities for 2017-2020 at the EU-Egypt Association Council, which took place in July 2017. The priorities make it clear that human rights &ndash; civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, as set out in international human rights law, the Treaty on European Union and the Egyptian Constitution &ndash; are a common value and constitute the cornerstone of a modern democratic state. These agreed priorities commit Egypt and the EU to promoting democracy, fundamental freedoms and human rights as constitutional rights of all citizens, in line with their international obligations.</p>  <p>  During the seventh EU-Egypt Association Council in December 2018, which is the forum for formal EU-Egypt political dialogue, the EU expressed concern about efforts in Egypt to limit freedom of expression and opinion, including through the arrest and sentencing of journalists and bloggers on anti-state charges. The EU also called on Egypt to adhere to its commitments to promote and protect the freedoms of expression, association and assembly, as well as the freedom of the press and access to information, as guaranteed by the 2014 Constitution and according to Egypt's international obligations. </p>  <p>  Ireland conveys these messages to Egypt on a regular basis at political and official levels, including most recently at a meeting between the Egyptian Embassy and the Human Rights Unit in my Department in June. I also discussed human rights with my Egyptian counterpart during his visit to Ireland in February.</p></reply>

The published document sets out a range of possibilities for economic revitalisation and growth for Palestinians and the neighbouring countries, which could be achieved if the parties can agree a settlement of the conflict, and large scale international investment can be attracted to the region. Part of the purpose of the workshop, which was aimed primarily at Gulf Arab states, was to introduce the plan to such possible donors or investors. Ireland was not represented at the meeting. </p>  <p>  This document covered economic issues only, and does not address the political questions, which are at the core of the search for peace in the Middle East. I understand that the US team continues to work on those elements. </p>  <p>  I have always been clear in my view that an economic element can help support a well-thought out political solution, by setting out a vision of a post conflict situation in which all are winners. But as I have stated consistently, it is not possible to solve political problems by economic means alone. Support to the Palestinian people is, of course, always important and welcome. However, any potential investor or donor, public or private, will be very conscious that the main impediment to economic development for Palestinians, and the reason for the severe contraction of the Palestinian economy over the last two decades, is the web of restrictions due to the Israeli occupation. It is thus very difficult to discuss economic possibilities separate from the political context. </p>  <p>  The EU has encouraged the US in its efforts to develop a peace plan, and Ireland has done this in all our contacts with the US Middle East team. It is my strong view that any plan must address the needs of both sides if it is to be successful. Preparing the ground can also be crucial to winning a considered hearing for any plan, and improved dialogue between the US team and Palestinian community and its leadership will be important in this regard.</p></reply>

Twenty-two observers participated in the first round of the election. This contribution was over four times larger than Ireland's usual deployment to an OSCE mission, and also represented the largest ever contribution to an election observation mission from a roster mustered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Five of these observers returned to observe round two in the Presidential election as part of the OSCE mission. Information concerning Ireland's contribution to the OSCE election observation mission in Ukraine is set out in the response to Parliamentary Question No. 51 of 18 April 2019, to which I refer the Deputy.  The complement of observers sent to the two elections in Ukraine is approximately half the number of Irish observers nominated in a calendar year.</p>  <p>  To ensure a spread of Irish representation as observers at elections elsewhere this year, including countries in which there are substantial Irish Aid funded programmes, the decision was made not to nominate volunteer observers to the OSCE mission observing the Parliamentary elections in Ukraine this July.</p></reply>

The review found that to include new hires in this manner could cause job displacement in the Irish labour market; if, for example, an Irish tax resident individual and a foreign based individual with similar skills both applied for the same job, it would be less costly for the employer to hire the foreign based individual. This would place the Irish tax resident individual at a considerable disadvantage.

The Directive provides that VAT registration thresholds may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation. Our VAT thresholds were increased to their current values, &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, on 1 May 2008 and as the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase these thresholds. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s VAT registration thresholds for small enterprises and the self-employed are among the highest in the EU. In addition, SMEs benefit from a range of VAT simplification measures including simplified and electronic invoicing, special schemes for retailers and pharmacists, the facility to make VAT returns on a bi-annual or annual basis, the cash receipts basis of accounting where the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is received, the facility for small businesses to submit an annual VIES return rather than monthly and the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) which allows business to register, file and pay VAT due in all Member States through the Irish MOSS system.</p></reply>

Therefore, there is no reliable basis to allow an estimate of the cost to be provided.</p><p>Regarding Question 91 the changes proposed to the R&amp;amp;D credit would have cash-flow impacts (in terms of timing of payments to the Exchequer) but would not ultimately incur an additional cost assuming there was no widening of the scope of the R&amp;amp;D to which the credit applies. The impact of these proposals cannot be ascertained in the absence of forecasts of likely future expenditure on R&amp;amp;D by such companies. </p><p>Regarding Question 93, a pre-approval process for the R&amp;amp;D credit should not incur an additional cost to the exchequer. At present a company claims the R&amp;amp;D tax credit on their self-assessed tax return. Revenue has advised me that in putting together a claim for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, the company must be satisfied that the claim will pass both the science test (i.e. that the activity is a qualifying activity) and the accounting test (i.e. is the amount of the claim correct).</p><p>Where, during risk profiling, Revenue identifies an uncertainty in respect of whether or not the activities are qualifying R&amp;amp;D activities, it will engage the services of an independent technical expert to validate the scientific/technological merits of the activity. Should a pre-approval process be introduced, limitations on the availability of these experts would give rise to delays, potentially acting as a barrier to companies carrying on R&amp;amp;D. In respect of the accounting test, it is not possible to verify that an amount is expended on qualifying R&amp;amp;D activities until the activity is carried on and the costs incurred. As such, in addition to the difficulty of implementing an equitable pre-approval process in relation to the science test, it is not possible to put in place an effective pre-approval process for the accounting test.</p></reply>

In this regard, the euro area flash headline inflation rate in June was stable at 1.2 per cent. The ECB projects that inflation will remain below target across the forecast horizon, reaching 1.6 per cent in 2021. </p><p>Quantitative easing (QE) refers to the large-scale asset purchases conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) in order to combat persistently low inflation. The ECB&rsquo;s Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and other monetary policy measures made a substantial contribution to the economic recovery in the euro area and Ireland. As a small and highly open member of the monetary union, disentangling the exact effect of the asset purchase program on Irish GDP is difficult. However, euro area estimates suggest that, on the whole, non-standard monetary policy measures including the asset purchase program, Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) and others, will increase real GDP by approximately 1.9 percentage points cumulatively between 2016 and 2020, with the strongest impact occurring in 2016 and 2017.Any increase in euro area real GDP growth in aggregate also has a strong second round impact on Ireland, by increasing foreign demand from Ireland&rsquo;s trading partners. </p><p>Overall, economic evidence generally points to QE as having had positive effects on the European economy, contributing to lowering sovereign debt yields and providing a small boost to bank lending, investment, real GDP, headline inflation, and medium-term inflationary expectations. The Irish economy has benefited in particular via a reduction in sovereign borrowing costs, additional liquidity in the banking sector, and an improvement in economic activity in key export markets. </p><p>Research by the Central Bank[2] has also shown that the announcement effect of the APP caused a compression of Irish bond yields. Over the course of the APP, the average yield on Irish sovereign bonds decreased, despite increased issuance and a longer maturity profile of outstanding debt, which demonstrates that the APP had a favourable impact on the cost of servicing Irish debt. The decrease in sovereign yields passed through into lower bank funding costs and ultimately to more favourable financing conditions to households and firms. </p><p>My Department will continue to monitor monetary policy developments, including with respect to growth and inflation in the euro area, and advise accordingly. While it is not possible to predict the future path of ECB monetary policy or interest rates, guidance from the ECB suggests that monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time yet. I am aware of the ECB President Mario Draghi&rsquo;s recent speech (18<sup>th</sup>June) on twenty years of the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy, where he referred to the current economic outlook and downside risks facing the European economy.  President Draghi noted that in the absence of a return of inflation to the ECB&rsquo;s target additional stimulus will be required. Furthermore, in the coming weeks, the ECB Governing Council will consider how the instruments at their disposal can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability.</p><p>Hammermann, Felix &amp;amp; Leonard, Kieran &amp;amp; Nardelli, Stefano &amp;amp; von Landesberger, Julian, 2019. &quot;Taking stock of the Eurosystem&rsquo;s asset purchase programme after the end of net asset purchases,&quot; Economic Bulletin Articles, European Central Bank, vol. 2. &amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-04a.238.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070400056#WRD03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 to 100, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) came into effect on 1 January 2018. The aim of the incentive is to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees, by way of a targeted share option programme. </p>  <p>  KEEP provides for an exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI on any gain realised on the exercise of a qualifying share option.  With limited exceptions, a key employee must hold the option for twelve months prior to exercise. However, it is likely that employees may hold the KEEP share options for a number of years before exercise, as the options must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant, so a benefit will only arise to the employee if the shares increase in value from that date. Where share options are exercised, and the shares are subsequently sold, such individuals will be subject to Capital Gains Tax on the disposal of the shares.</p>  <p>  As KEEP is a demand-led scheme, uptake will depend on the decisions made by qualifying SME companies with regard to the offering of share options to employees, and also on the growth in value of the employer company shares in the period between grant and exercise of the options.  The uptake of KEEP thus far has been limited. Given the longer-term nature of the incentive, Revenue has, as yet, relatively little information on which to estimate the cost and other consequences of possible changes.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as there is no information available on the potential increased uptake of KEEP if employees were allowed to work in multiple companies within a group structure, or if the shares were not restricted to new shares, there is no underlying data on which to estimate a cost of removing such restrictions. Under KEEP, only full-time employees or directors who are required to work at least 30 hours per week with a company are eligible to participate. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that there is no information on the potential increased uptake of the programme if the requirement in respect of being a full-time employee was removed.  As such, there is no underlying data on which to estimate the cost of such a change.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that some 10 companies granted qualifying share options to 87 key employees during 2018 (the first year of the scheme). As no exercises occurred in 2018, there is no cost to the exchequer for 2018 in terms of income tax, USC and PRSI.  Returns for 2019, which will contain details of all options granted and exercised during 2019, will not be filed with Revenue until 31 March 2020. </p>  <p>  With a view to enhancing the attractiveness of the scheme, Finance Act 2018 amended the restriction applying to the total market value of shares which can be granted by the qualifying company to a qualifying employee, by increasing the limit from 50% of salary to 100% of salary (i.e. that participants may now receive of equal values of shares and salary).  This required state aid approval from the European Commission, which has recently been granted, and I expect to commence this change shortly. Revenue advise me that there is no underlying data on which to estimate the cost of this change. </p>  <p>  Currently, the total market value of the issued but unexercised qualifying share option a company may grant cannot exceed &euro;3 million.  Revenue advise me that it is not possible to estimate the number of companies who might exceed the &euro;6 million, &euro;12 million or &euro;24 million thresholds outlined by the Deputy and thus benefit from raising this restriction or removing it.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy may be aware, my Department recently carried out a public consultation process in relation to KEEP and other tax incentives targeted at the SME sector with a view to identifying possible enhancements that might be made to the scheme to make it more efficient and effective. The intention is that issues raised by stakeholders during the consultation will be analysed and proposals will be submitted to me for consideration in the context of this year's Finance Bill.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. </p><p>One of its functions under the Act involves IFAC providing an independent assessment of the official macroeconomic forecasts of the Department of Finance. This is the so-called &lsquo;endorsement function&rsquo; which requires that IFAC &ldquo;<i>endorse, as it considers appropriate, the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by the Department of Finance on which the Budget and Stability Programme will be based</i>&rdquo;. </p><p>It is in this context that my officials meet with members of the IFAC Secretariat and Council as part of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) and the Budget process each year. However, beyond the Council&rsquo;s statutory functions, as provided for under the 2012 Fiscal Responsibility Act, IFAC has no legislative role in the production or analysis of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) reports. I can confirm therefore that neither I nor my officials have had any meetings with the IFAC in this regard. </p><p>Separately, a representative from my Department attends the meetings of the NCC in an advisory capacity. However, policy responsibility for competitiveness issues lies with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation (BEI) and as such, the NCC prepares and submits its reports to the Taoiseach and the Government, through the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The Department of Finance perspective is that as a small open economy, it is essential that we maintain our competitiveness and ensure that the cost of doing business does not act as an impediment to this. In this regard, <i>Future Jobs Ireland</i>is an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s over-arching plan for the future of the Irish economy. Given the central role that the NCC plays in informing competitiveness and productivity policy, in <i>Future Jobs 2019</i>the Government has committed to responding to the NCC&rsquo;s annual priority recommendations to enhance productivity and competitiveness performance. </p><p>As we look to the future, we must be cognisant of the risks to the outlook posed by Brexit, increasing protectionism and changes to the international tax landscape. Given these challenges over the horizon, the government remains committed to ensuring that our economy is as resilient in bad times as it is dynamic in good times.  </p><p>As Minister for Finance, the best way to ensure that we chart a way forward through these uncertain times ahead, is through continued prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by ensuring we focus on competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. The income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits and gains to shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other business (i.e. non-property business) that it carries on.  </p><p>Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than those distributed to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax. I am advised by Revenue that the available information is the net DWT collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs for 2015 onwards and is set out in the following table. Identification of the refunds of DWT specific to REITs payments is not readily available as it would require a review of the returns of individual taxpayers.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Amount of DWT Collected </th></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>&euro;4.0m </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>&euro;7.8m </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>&euro;11.8m </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>&euro;12.4m </td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the Deputy's second question, Section 23 Finance Act 2016 introduced, and Section 18 Finance Act 2017 amended, the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime, which took effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017. Unit holders in an IREF are subject to IREF withholding tax at a rate of 20% on payments made to them by the fund. IREFs are required to declare and pay this withholding tax on an annual basis. I am advised by Revenue that the first return and payment of IREF withholding tax was due 31 July 2018, for funds having accounting periods that ended in the second half of 2017.  The amount of IREF withholding tax collected on the distribution of profits by relevant IREFs was  approximately &euro;9m for this period. </p><p>Returns were due to Revenue in January in respect of funds with accounting periods ending in the six months to July of 2018.  These returns are currently being analysed and information will be available in due course. As is the case with REITs, identification of the refunds of DWT specific to IREF payments is not readily available as it would require a review of the returns of individual taxpayers.</p></reply>

A party to an appeal which is dissatisfied with a Tax Appeals Commission determination on the grounds that the determination is erroneous on a point of law, may require the Appeal Commissioner to state and sign a &ldquo;case stated&rdquo; for the opinion of the High Court. A request for a case stated does not necessarily mean that an appeal will be filed at the High Court &ndash; the ultimate decision as to whether or not to lodge the appeal to the High Court rests with the party who requested the case stated.</p><p>I am advised by the Tax Appeals Commission that the following table shows the number of determinations which resulted in a request to state and sign a case stated by the Appeals Commissioner, since establishment:<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Request for cases stated </th></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>11 </td></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>22 </td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following table contains information in relation to the years 2016 to date for the number of instances in which the Revenue Commissioners have appealed a determination of the Appeal Commissioners to the courts and the outcome of these appeals. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>No. appeals </th><th>Settled and/or withdrawn</th><th>Awaiting a hearing </th><th>Struck out </th><th>Awaiting a decision </th><th>Revenue unsuccessful </th></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td></td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td>2 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>7 </td><td>Nil </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td></tr></table></p><p>The following table contains information in relation to the years 2016 to date for the number of cases in which a taxpayer has appealed a determination of the Appeal Commissioners to the courts and the outcome of these appeals. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>No. appeals </th><th>Settled and/or withdrawn </th><th>Awaiting a hearing </th><th>Struck out </th><th>Awaiting a decision </th></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td>1 </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>6 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>7 </td><td>3 </td><td>3 </td><td>Nil </td><td>1 </td></tr></table></p><p>I am further advised by both the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Appeals Commission that neither are in a position to provide information on the value of the tax at the centre of these appeals in the time allowed for the reply to these questions.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners however will carry out an exercise to obtain the information concerned and they will communicate directly with the Deputy in that regard.  However, in that context, it is important to note that all taxpayers are entitled to confidentiality in the handling of their tax affairs, including in the case of matters that end up subject to the appeals process. Consequently, in providing any statistical information in relation to a relatively small number of cases that have been appealed to the courts, the Revenue Commissioners must be mindful that they do not inadvertently breach, or run the risk of breaching in the future, their statutory obligation under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to preserve a taxpayer&rsquo;s right to confidentiality. </p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission do not keep a record of the value of tax in relation to these appeals. An application to the High Court following a case stated is a matter for the parties to an appeal and this information is not available to the Tax Appeals Commission.</p></reply>

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs, address gaps and potential failures in the Irish SME finance market, as well as encouraging competition and innovation, and facilitating the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities that support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs.  </p><p>Instead of lending directly to SMEs, the SBCI operates through partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers and currently has 6 on-lenders, 3 bank and 3 non-bank finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Finance Ireland Limited, Bibby Financial Services Ireland, and FEXCO Asset Finance.  </p><p>The SBCI&rsquo;s priority is meeting the credit needs of SMEs not currently being fully met by the private sector. Consequently, the SBCI&rsquo;s lending to SMEs is largely driven by market demands. Figures provided by the SBCI to my Department show that, since the SBCI began its activities in March 2015, to the end of December 2018, the total amount of SBCI supported lending activity, through the provision of liquidity, was &euro;900 million to 21,783 Irish SMEs supporting 141,658 jobs. Under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk sharing schemes, &euro;152 million has been drawn down by 4,278 SMEs, this has supported 6,572 jobs. The SMEs who have received SBCI finance are from a variety of business sectors with agriculture consistently representing the largest sector. </p><p>A breakdown of the SBCI&rsquo;s supported lending for each year and broken down by sector is provided in the following tables:  </p><p><b>2015</b></p><p><b>Liquidity Scheme: 4,558 loans drawn totalling &euro;205,729,822</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Service</td><td>6%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Admin &amp;amp; Support Service</td><td>17%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>38%</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>5%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>5%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Professional &amp;amp; Scientific</td><td>4%</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport &amp;amp; Storage</td><td>3%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade </td><td>13%</td><td>18%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2016</b></p><p><b>Liquidity Scheme: 8,161 loans drawn totalling &euro;367,896,310</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Service</td><td>6%</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>Admin &amp;amp; Support Service</td><td>16%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>37%</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>7%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>5%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Professional &amp;amp; Scientific</td><td>4%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport &amp;amp; Storage</td><td>4%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade </td><td>12%</td><td>18%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2017</b></p><p><b>Liquidity Scheme: 6,099 loans drawn totalling &euro;215,508,073</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Service</td><td>5%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Admin &amp;amp; Support Service</td><td>13%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>42%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>9%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>4%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>8%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Professional &amp;amp; Scientific</td><td>3%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport &amp;amp; Storage</td><td>4%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade </td><td>12%</td><td>15%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme: 4,247 loans drawn totalling &euro;144,945,687</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>47%</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>38%</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td>Horticulture</td><td>1%</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>6%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat</td><td>1%</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td>3%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Tillage</td><td>4%</td><td>7%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2018</b></p><p><b>Liquidity Scheme: 2,987 loans drawn totalling &euro;110,636,574</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>47%</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>38%</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td>Horticulture</td><td>1%</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>6%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat</td><td>1%</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td>3%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Tillage</td><td>4%</td><td>7%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Brexit Loan Scheme:  60 loans drawn totalling &euro;13,645,025</b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Service</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture (Non Primary)</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Construction Sector</td><td>3%Number</td></tr><tr><td>ManufacturingAccommodation &amp;amp; Food Service</td><td>30%2%</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Professional &amp;amp; Scientific</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade </td><td>27%</td></tr></table></p><p>The SBCI continues to work on developing new innovative products, such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, and the Future Growth Loan Scheme.

This follows extensive preparatory work by my officials, in consultation with the Central Bank, over the past year. </p>  <p>  The next step in the process is engagement by my officials with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to begin drafting Heads of Bill.  The issues being addressed by this legislation are complex and are required to be constitutionally sound in the event of legal challenge. This will require careful drafting to ensure that the proposed legislation is robust, fit for purpose, and legally sound. It is my intention to bring forward draft heads of Bill to Government for approval later this year and to progress the Bill for debate in the Houses following this.  </p>  <p>  The proposed legislation is necessary and timely and will drive positive changes in terms of wider banking culture, greater delegation of responsibilities, and enhanced accountability while simplifying the taking of sanctions against individuals who fail in their financial sector roles.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the legislation will give the Central Bank the power to make regulations intended to drive greater accountability in the financial sector, raising the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms, in order to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system. </p>  <p>  The draft Heads of Bill will provide for: </p>  <p>  - Introduction of a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which places obligations on firms and senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making lies;</p>  <p>  - Introduction of Conduct Standards for individuals and firms to provide for statutory powers to set and impose binding and enforceable obligations on all Regulated Financial Service Providers (RFSPs) and individuals working within them with respect to expected standards of conduct; </p>  <p>  - An enhanced Fitness &amp;amp; Probity Regime which includes provisions to enhance its effective operation and its ability to support the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposed individual accountability framework and the conduct standards for individuals and firms;</p>  <p>  - Breaking the &ldquo;Participation Link&rdquo; which addresses the known deficiency in the legislation which requires the Central Bank to first prove a contravention of financial services legislation against a RFSP before it can take an action against an individual; and</p>  <p>  - Technical amendments to improve existing legislation and clarify certain statutory processes.</p>  <p>  I also intend to address the principles set forth in Deputy Pearse Doherty's Private Member's legislation, around the provision of false and misleading information to the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The ILP Act has been in use since 1994 and it is widely acknowledged that it needs to be updated to fit the environment and its intended clientele.  There have been significant changes in the financial area in the past 25 years and the revisions contained in the published Bill are aimed at modernising the legislation.  In doing so, this will underpin one of the strategic priorities in the recently published 'Ireland for Finance' strategy document, which is to make Ireland a global location for private equity funds. </p>  <p>  The Bill of the amendments to the 1994 ILP Act was recently published. The intention is to progress the Bill through the Oireachtas as soon as possible and with the cooperation of all concerned it is hoped that it will have passed all stages this year. With this in mind, I anticipate that the Bill will be introduced into the House in the early Autumn session.</p></reply>

While it does not provide an exhaustive list of all capital expenditure, the list of projects serves to highlight the diverse range of infrastructural demands competing for the resources of the State.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  </p>  <p>  WTO rules and EU Directives on public procurement require that public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts, the threshold is &euro;5,548,000; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments, the threshold is &euro;144,000 and for the remainder of public bodies, the threshold is &euro;221,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;443,000.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Office of Government Procurement developed Circular 10/14 which is aimed at facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises in competing for public procurement opportunities. In this regard, the following national rules apply to below EU threshold procurements:</p>  <p>  - All public contracts for supplies and services with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) and upwards should be advertised on the national public procurement website, www.etenders.gov.ie.       </p>  <p>  - The advertising threshold for works is set at &euro;50,000 (exclusive of VAT).  </p>  <p>  - Suppliers of goods and services and especially the SME sector are encouraged to register on the e-Tenders website and avail of its facilities including receiving automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that these thresholds were reviewed last year in consultation with the SME Advisory Group, chaired by my colleague, Minister of State O'Donovan, which is comprised of representatives from IBEC, SFA, CIF, ISME and Chambers Ireland and it was recommended that the national thresholds remain at the current levels. The main reasons for setting the national thresholds at these levels is to open up public procurement opportunities to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and to achieve value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money through competitive and transparent tendering processes. It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used. </p>  <p>  These thresholds for advertising on etenders will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities, particularly the SME sector.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in the Waterford school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

In such circumstances the school can apply to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools.</p><p>There are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011, including 1,196 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD &ndash; 131 Early Intervention, 743 Primary and 322 Post-primary.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have advised that for the 2019/20 school year there will be a total of 1,618 special classes of which 1,353 will be for children diagnosed with autism.</p><p>124 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available in tabular form by county on the NCSE website at </p><p>Details of primary and post primary schools where Special Education Needs Bases have been approved may be viewed on my Department's website at  and this information is updated regularly.</p></reply>

This includes the student contribution fee for Irish and EU citizens which currently stands at &euro;3,000 for the 2018/19 academic year.  </p>  <p>   This is in line with assurances given in previous years.  I want to make clear my determination that co-operation and collaboration between the education systems on this island should not be maintained but strengthened between education institutions.  I am also anxious that this extends on an East-West basis. Facilitating student mobility is a key dimension of this process.  It is my intention that students from Northern Ireland will maintain access to EU fees status post Brexit. This is currently being addressed in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA).  In May 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding on the CTA was signed between my colleague, An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D. and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington MP in May 2019.  It stated that Irish and British citizens will maintain the right to access all levels of education and training, and associated student support, in each other&rsquo;s state, on terms no less favourable than those for the citizens of that state.  </p>  <p>   My Department is currently finalising arrangements with the Department for Education in London, which will elaborate on this principle.  I hope to be make an announcement in this regard in the near future, and I know that it will bring the required clarity for Northern Irish students and their families.</p></reply>

Section 44 of the Education and Training Board Act 2013 provides for the establishment of such committees.  This section provides that such a committee shall consist of not more than 12 members and that the chief executive or staff of the ETB, other than a staff member who is a member of the Education and Training Board, shall not be a member of a committee of the Board.  The section also provides that an ETB may appoint a person to be chairperson of such a committee. </p><p>In February 2015, pursuant to Sections 44(11) and 44(12)(c) of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, the then Minister for Education and Skills directed that boards of management of schools and other centres of education established by an education and training board under section 44 may consist exclusively of members who are not members of the education and training board by which they were established.</p><p>Boards of Management of ETB schools and community colleges should be constituted as per the Board of Management Handbook for Education and Training Boards and Boards of Management of ETB Schools and Community Colleges which has been prepared by Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) in conjunction with the sector and with my Department. A copy of this handbook is in the following link for the Deputy's information.   The arrangements in relation to membership of Boards are set out on pages 17 and 18 of the handbook.</p><p>The handbook provides that the term of office of a board of management of an ETB  school or community College is normally for the duration of the term of office of the ETB, other than in the case of a newly established college. Following the local elections in 2014, the term of ETB Boards of Management was extended until 31st May 2015 in order to provide continuity of service in schools and centres of education during the initial period following the expiry of the term of office of the new ETB Boards.  Following the recent local elections, I have directed that the term of office of Finance, Audit &amp;amp; Risk Committees and Boards of Management of schools and other centres of education operated by ETBs may be extended to 30th November 2019 in order to facilitate transition and to ensure continuity of governance and oversight during this period of changeover from the current Committees and Boards to the new Committees and Boards of ETBs.</p><p>In relation to terms of reference of ETB Boards of Management, section B of the handbook deals with matters relating to the role, powers, functions, establishment, dissolution, membership and operation of a school/college board of management while section C of the Handbook deals with the specific duties and responsibilities of a school/college board of management.</p></reply>

Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.</p>  <p>  According to the latest data available, as at close of business on the 28 June, there were 663 eligibility applications received by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, of which 598 have been deemed eligible. Of these 598 eligible applicants, 145 have progressed to sanction with their banks. The value of the sanctioned loans from banks at 28 June was &euro;31.65 million. While data on actual funding received by applicants as of 28 June is not available, we know that there is a high conversion from sanctioned loans to drawdown, as SBCI data for the end of March 2019 indicates that 88% of the total value of loans sanctioned by banks had been drawn down by businesses.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Brexit Loan Scheme, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Finance and with the support of the European Investment Bank guarantee, has developed the Future Growth Loan Scheme. </p>  <p>  This scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is open to eligible Irish businesses and the primary agriculture and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. Finance provided under the scheme is competitively priced and has favourable terms, for example no security required for loans up to &euro;500,000.  The scheme opened for eligibility applications on 17th April, and since then the SBCI has received 365 eligibility applications and issued 340 eligibility letters. </p>  <p>  With Brexit on the horizon, the availability of both the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme means that qualifying Irish businesses will have access to low cost capital without delay and forms part of the support for Irish business to cope with potential Brexit challenges.</p></reply>

The EGFSN plays a key role in identifying and advising the Government on current and future skills needs, through the undertaking of research, analysis and horizon scanning on current and emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectoral levels. Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or implications relating to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, Brexit/trade related skills needs, and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  As part of the National Skills Architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, which includes representation from the chief skills stakeholders within the Irish economy, including my Department. </p>  <p>  Together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and employment permit trends, the Council works to enhance the response of the education and training system to the provision and delivery of those skills. In considering the recommendations of the EGFSN, the Government and relevant stakeholders are guided by the timeframes advised by the Group in its individual reports.</p>  <p>  This National Skills Architecture, underpinned by robust analysis and data collection on skills needs, ensures an education and training system that can be responsive and flexible in meeting the evolving skills needs of the economy, especially under the impact of continuing technological change. </p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and SLRMU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit, which holds responsibility for the employment permits system and manages the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and Ineligible Categories List. </p>  <p>  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill areas of identified skills shortage. This objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work, and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning inclusion or omission from the occupations list is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. </p>  <p>  The analysis of the EGFSN, and other work by my Department, have been reflected in the overarching longer term strategies for the education and training system published in recent years. These include Technology Skills 2022, Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, including its associated annual implementation and successor plans, all of which have been developed by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The EGFSN&rsquo;s analysis has continued to inform the development of my own Department&rsquo;s policies and strategies, such as Enterprise 2025 and the Action Plan for Jobs. More recently, EGFSN&rsquo;s analysis has informed Future Jobs Ireland - a key pillars of which is enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent. This pillar is underpinned by a number of ambitions such as the provision of high quality and timely education and training responses to evolving enterprise and skills needs; encouraging lifelong learning and upskilling; and fostering participation in apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.</p></reply>

It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant proportion of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. </p><p>More broadly, creating more jobs in the regions will remain a top priority for both the IDA and my Department as we seek to build on the progress made over the last number of years. In 2018, for example, the IDA delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. The Agency's mid-year results for 2019 have also reflected a number of significant investments for regional locations. Since the IDA&rsquo;s current five-year strategy was launched in 2015 there have been 455 investments secured for the regions. This is a testament to the focus IDA Ireland has placed on regional development and the whole of government action to enhance our regional offering.</p><p>The following table details the number of IDA site visits to each county in quarter 1 of 2019 and the percentage of visits in each county as a percentage of the number of visits nationally.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Q1 2019</th><th>% of total site visits in Q1 2019</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>3</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>5</td><td>3.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>17</td><td>10.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>56</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>9</td><td>5.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>3</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>5</td><td>3.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>12</td><td>7.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>10</td><td>6.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>2</td><td>1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>8</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>8</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>6</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1</td><td>0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>4</td><td>2.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>159</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As far as those actions related to my Department are concerned, this has been reflected in:</p><p>- The participation of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and its enterprise agencies in the Government's national Brexit preparedness public information and awareness campaign, &quot;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&quot;.</p><p>- My Department's establishment of a dedicated &quot;Getting Business Brexit Ready&quot; web portal, which includes sections on advice and guidance, financial supports, and upskilling, and is linked to by my Department's Brexit social media campaign.</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland's national and regional communications campaign urging companies to prepare for Brexit through planning, innovating, competing and diversifying their trade, which complements its promotion of the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Brexit Advisory Clinics, and Act on Support programme.</p><p>- The awareness raising and outreach, as well as Brexit supports, offered by InterTradeIreland and the Local Enterprise Office network, including the Brexit Planning Online Guide, Start to Plan and Brexit Implementation Vouchers, the Brexit mentor programme, as well as Brexit related conferences, workshops and targeted radio and social media advertising campaigns.</p><p>- My Department's engagement with the Revenue Commissioners in the roll out of its Trader Engagement programme, the support for customs training and advice offered under InterTradeIreland's Start to Plan voucher, the launch of Enterprise Ireland's Customs Insights and InterTradeIreland's Customs Virtual Learning Environment courses, and the roll out of the Local Enterprise Office &quot;Prepare Your Business for Customs&quot; workshops.</p><p>- The publication by my Department of the Currency Risk Management for Irish SMEs guide, and support for financial and currency management advice and training under Enterprise Ireland's Act On programme, InterTradeIreland's Start to Plan voucher, and Enterprise Ireland's Management Development training provision.</p><p>- My Department's contribution towards the roll out of <i>Global Footprint 2025</i>, which will work to raise Ireland's profile internationally, including as a place to live, do business, and invest; the implementation of the Government's Diaspora policy, <i>Global Irish;</i>and the implementation of the recommendations of the <i>Review of Economic Migration Policy, </i>published in September 2018, which will ensure the policies governing the employment permit system are fully supportive of Ireland's emerging labour market needs. </p><p>More generally, my Department and its enterprise agencies have continued to engage with the National Skills Architecture overseen by the Department of Education and Skills, to ensure that those trade and logistics related skills needs identified in the report, and amongst client companies, are serviced by education and training provision across further education and training, higher education and Skillnet Ireland training networks. </p><p>The report also highlighted longer term objectives in its recommendations, directed towards tackling any structural issues and building up the skills base that will support the continued success of the Irish economy in the post-Brexit trading environment. </p><p>These include the successful implementation of the Government's ten year languages strategy, <i>Languages Connect, </i>the enhancement of intercultural skills, in particular through the boosting of international graduate mobility opportunities and an increase in Irish participation in the Erasmus+ programme, as set out in the <i>International Education Strategy</i>; and an increase in the pool of product or service design and development skills, key differentiators in international markets, through the successful implementation of <i>Innovation 2020,</i>the <i>STEM Education Policy Statement, 2017-2026</i>and <i>Technology Skills 2022</i>.</p><p>A key longer term recommendation was for the establishment of a Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group, to be composed of logistics and supply chain industry stakeholders and education and training representatives, which would work to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable development in logistics and supply chain activities. </p><p>Officials from my Department have worked closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport- which will chair this group- and logistics and supply chain stakeholders, on its establishment, and its is anticipated that a work programme will be agreed upon and the group formally established in the coming months. </p><p>Through cross industry collaboration the group will work to improve the profile of logistics and supply chain roles, making it easier to recruit talent; make progression pathways available to those entering or already working in the roles; ensure development opportunities are available to provide the skills, knowledge, and competencies required; enhance employee retention; and provide a forum for ongoing communication and leadership by logistics and supply chain stakeholders in addressing the skills needs of these activities in Ireland.</p></reply>

After the process of &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and the preparation of the legal texts in the various languages was completed, the EU and Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) along with the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) on 30th June last.</p><p>The FTA will unlock a market with significant potential for Irish and EU firms and includes the elimination of nearly all tariffs (over 99%) on EU exports to Vietnam.  Widespread coverage is achieved at entry into force, with 65% of EU exports to Vietnam coming in duty-free from day one.  Tariffs on our remaining trade &ndash; with the exception of a few products &ndash; will be fully liberalised after 10 years.  These sensitive items are not offensive export interests for Ireland.  The EU will liberalise 71% of its imports from Vietnam from day-one and 99% will enter duty-free after seven years.  The EU-Vietnam FTA provides for the full dismantling of nearly all tariffs except for a few tariff lines that are subject to duty-free Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs).  The gradual elimination of custom duties on these sensitive products will allow domestic producers to gradually adapt.  Consumers from both sides will benefit from lower prices and exporters from strengthened competitiveness.</p><p>Sectoral opportunities include almost all EU exports of machinery and appliances which will be fully liberalised at entry into force of the FTA.  Around half of EU pharmaceutical exports will be duty-free immediately and the rest after seven years.  Close to 70% of EU chemicals exports will be duty free at entry into force and the rest after three, five and seven years respectively.  In addition, Vietnam will also simplify requirements for marketing authorisation of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, which in turn will reduce delays and costs for these important Irish exports.</p><p>The FTA also improves market access by addressing non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related issues such as public procurement, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, and sustainable development.  The benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  </p><p>In 2018, Ireland&rsquo;s goods exports to Vietnam amounted to &euro;65 million.  Ireland&rsquo;s main exports to Vietnam include medical and pharmaceutical products valued at &euro;18.6m in 2018.  Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years.  While meat and dairy products are the largest share of this, beverages and seafood also contributed strongly.  In 2017 (the most recent year with available figures), services exports from Ireland to Vietnam were valued at &euro;164m.</p><p>Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, Enterprise Ireland will open a new office in Ho Chi Minh City this year to support Irish businesses to expand into the Vietnamese market and to take advantage of the new opportunities presented by the FTA. </p><p>Opportunities exist for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated over a 7-year period following entry into force of the FTA.  The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers. </p><p>Ireland is an exceptionally open economy and is dependent on international trade and investment as sources of growth.  Building new export opportunities for our businesses forms a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.  We favour ambitious and balanced trade agreements, negotiated by the EU Commission on our behalf, which are designed to deliver jobs and growth for the benefit of our citizens.  The EU-Vietnam FTA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  </p><p>In a wider context, Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  The EU is working towards achieving a region-to-region FTA with ASEAN by first concluding FTAs with individual ASEAN members.  The first of these was signed with Singapore in October 2018, the Vietnam FTA is the second, and negotiations for an FTA with Indonesia, the largest county in the ASEAN group, are ongoing.  </p><p>The text of the EU-Vietnam Agreement, including tariff schedules, has been published can be accessed at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries. Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council as has the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will see a comprehensive liberalisation of trade in goods. Mercosur will fully liberalise 91% of its imports from the EU over a transition period of 10 years with longer liberalisation of up to 15 years for some more sensitive products. The EU, in turn, will liberalise 92% of its imports from Mercosur over a transition period of up to 10 years. Tariff lines will also be liberalised with Mercosur liberalising 91% of its lines and the 95% in the EU. </p>  <p>  Full details, including the line-by-line tariff breakdown of these sectors and the import/export tariff rates are not available at this time.  My officials await further detail from the Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s key offensive sectors within Mercosur are dairy, particularly cheese, powdered milk and infant formula with Mercosur agreeing to large tariff rate quotas of 30,000, 10,000 and 5,000 tonnes. Ireland also has offensive interests in the pharmaceutical, machinery, and chemical sector. For each of these sectors, liberalisation takes place for over 90% of EU exports. </p>  <p>  The Agreement also sees the opening up of Mercosur&rsquo;s public procurement market. Mercosur&rsquo;s procurement market has up until this agreement not been available to EU firms. The Agreement, therefore, provides Irish SMEs with substantial opportunities. It will make it easier for our firms to bid for and win valuable Government contracts in the four Mercosur countries. The EU and Mercosur have agreed to apply modern disciplines based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and fairness. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Agreement also includes 335 Geographical Indicators (GIs) of EU origin. Irish Whiskey and Irish Cream are included in this list. The acceptance of EU GIs will significantly improve protection of these products from false or misleading branding in Mercosur markets.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s defensive interests are generally well known and understood at EU level. Access to the EU beef market has always been a particular sensitivity for Ireland and a number of other EU Member States. While it is disappointing that the agreement reached on beef access is more than we would have wished, it is far less than the Mercosur block originally sought. The deal that has been agreed provides necessary reassurances on food safety &ndash; i.e. that the EU will not accept any lesser standard in respect of the additional quota of 99,000 tonnes.  It also ensures an extended lead-in period (over six years) before full tariff reduction levels are reached.  </p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Agreement also has a special chapter on SMEs. SMEs will benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures &ndash; as the savings are proportionately greater for them. A dedicated website will provide information on the Agreement for SMEs, practical guidance to importing and exporting will be published, and a dedicated data base on tariff reductions will be made available. The simplification of regulations on standards will help with trade barriers encountered by SMEs. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on an impact assessment, my Department commissioned by open tender, a study of Free Trade Agreements, more than 12 months ago.  Copenhagen Economics were awarded this contract as an internationally renowned trade modelling firm. The study covered a wide range of recent and prospective EU trade agreements, including that with Mercosur. The preliminary findings, which was grounded in the information available at the time, suggest a doubling of annual goods and services exports to Mercosur over the 10 years to 2030.</p>  <p>  In light of the conclusion of the negotiations last Friday, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine will now ensure that a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out specifically on the finalised EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement. This assessment will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs as well as the environmental implications of the deal. It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might exacerbate/mitigate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy.  This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to EU-Mercosur agreement.</p></reply>

I also note that high vulnerability exposures are not concentrated in any particular region or regions, that borrowers in the Accommodation and Food and Wholesale and Retail sectors account for over half of high vulnerability balances and that term loans and overdraft facilities make up over ninety per cent of high vulnerability balances. </p><p>My Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to assist businesses at all stages of development and across all sectors. The suite of finance supports have been developed to address market failures including cost of finance, need for collateral, availability of loans for microenterprises, and availability of loans with terms of longer than 7 years.</p><p>These supports include schemes such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme,  the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the provision of loans through Microfinance Ireland, all designed to ensure that SMEs have access to affordable and appropriate finance when required.  My Department also supports alternative sources of finance for SMEs such as through the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, the fifth programme of which (2019-2024) launched late last year. </p><p>An important support is the Credit Review Office, which was established to help all Small Medium Enterprises or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3m declined or reduced, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  The Office also looks at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  </p><p>Most recently my Department has produced an Overview of Government Supports for Indigenous Business. This sets out in detail the Government supports available to develop and build capacity in indigenous enterprises across Ireland, delivered through a network of bodies with a wide reach into urban and rural localities. In addition to supports for start-ups and developing businesses, the report sets out supports that incentivise research, development and innovation, supports for regional businesses and supports that address informational, technical and skills gaps in SME businesses.  This report is available at </p><p>I recognise that Brexit is a significant issue for all firms and to this end, the Overview of Government Supports for Indigenous Business also highlights the networks, structures and supports that have been put in place for indigenous local businesses in identifying key risk areas and in facilitating the practical actions to be taken in response to the UK's exit from the EU.</p><p>Regarding specifically the issues surrounding Brexit, the Quick Brexit Guide for Business is  also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  seeks to answer many of the questions that Irish businesses may have when assessing their exposure to Brexit and determining the best course of action to mitigate their likely Brexit-related difficulties. It provides information on the practical steps you can take to deal with issues including: Customs, tariffs and duties, currency, imports, certification, working capital, and financing.</p><p>My Department has also published a number of other information guides to raise awareness of supports and finance related issues among SMEs. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  and include a guide on &lsquo;Government working with finance providers to support SME financing&rsquo; which sets out the types of equity and debt financing supports and resources available to business at all stages of the business cycle. The &lsquo;Currency Risk Management for Irish SMEs&rsquo;  guide seeks to answer questions that SMEs may have when assessing and managing their exposure to foreign currency risk and features a directory of support services and providers that are available in the market.</p></reply>

In this regard, where an agreement covers only areas where the Union has exclusive competence under the EU Treaties, the agreement must be an EU-only agreement. On the other hand, where an agreement covers areas where competence is shared with the Member States (or contains areas of Union competence and exclusive Member State competence), it will be a "mixed" agreement referred to as an Association Agreement, with both the EU and the Member States being parties to it.</p>  <p>  In order to determine whether an agreement entered into by the EU should be EU-only or "mixed", it is necessary to examine its contents to see whether it covers areas of EU exclusive competence, or of shared competence, or of Member States&rsquo; exclusive competence.</p>  <p>  In relation to free trade agreements, EU exclusive competence can arise in two ways. First, the Common Commercial Policy is an exclusive competence of the European Union under the EU Treaties. Thus, any provisions of a free trade agreement covering areas such as trade in goods, or sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures will fall within the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) interprets the scope of the Common Commercial Policy very broadly, and holds that foreign direct investment, most trade in services, and sustainable development provisions all fall within the scope of the Common Commercial Policy and therefore, with the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence. EU exclusive competence can also arise where provisions of an international agreement would affect the EU&rsquo;s internal rules or alter their scope.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, a "mixed" agreement contains aspects where the competence is shared between the Union and the Member States. Aspects of "mixed" competence, insofar as trade is concerned, are often provisions concerning Investment Protection and the EU Investment Court System. However, where an agreement also contains provisions which go beyond the broad area of trade and fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States &ndash; for instance, provisions concerning political cooperation in foreign policy areas &ndash; such an agreement would be considered to be "mixed".</p>  <p>  When any Agreement is finalised, such as with Mercosur, the Commission proposes the Agreement to the Council and in doing so, it indicates to the Member States its view on competence and, therefore, ratification. Nationally, Ireland would then confer with the Office of the Attorney General for their views.</p>  <p>  Insofar as Mercosur is concerned, it is our current understanding that it will be a "mixed" agreement. While the Trade Agreement elements fall under the exclusive competence of the Commission and are, therefore, ratified by Member States in Council under Qualified Majority voting and by the European Parliament, the EU-Mercosur Agreement is a wider 'mixed' Agreement &ndash; including Trade &ndash; with areas of &ldquo;shared competence&rdquo; (such as political co-operation elements).</p>  <p>  However, the text of the EU-Mercosur Agreement will now have to proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take between several months and up to two years to complete, before a final text is available.</p>  <p>  "Mixed" agreements only enter into force once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own national procedures. As this process may take several years, the Commission could propose that the Agreement be applied provisionally in respect of those aspects of the Agreement for which it has exclusive competence, such as trade.  Such provisional application requires agreement by the Council and ratification by the European Parliament.  It is not possible at this stage to be definitive about what timelines may apply in respect of ratifying the EU-Mercosur Agreement, until a final text is available. However, it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that the EU-Mercosur Agreement will be a "mixed" Agreement, ultimately requiring the involvement of D&aacute;il Eireann in its ratification process.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on an assessment, my Department commissioned by open tender, a study of Free Trade Agreements, more than 12 months ago.  Copenhagen Economics were awarded this contract as an internationally renowned trade modelling firm. The study covered a wide range of recent and prospective EU trade agreements, including that with Mercosur. The preliminary findings, which was grounded in the information available at the time, suggest a doubling of annual goods and services exports to Mercosur over the 10 years to 2030.</p>  <p>  In light of the conclusion of the negotiations last Friday, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine will now ensure that a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out specifically on the finalised EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement. This assessment will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs as well as the environmental implications of the deal. It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might exacerbate/mitigate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy.  This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to EU-Mercosur agreement.</p></reply>

On 2 May 2019, the Department of Justice forwarded correspondence to the Department of Health that it had received from the Office of the State Pathologist advising that State post-mortems would no longer be conducted in the mortuary at UHW. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Department of Health engaged with the Office of the State Pathologist which advised that, pending the building of a new mortuary at UHW, State post-mortem examinations from the Waterford region, would be performed at alternative venues, including Dublin, Cork and Tullamore.  On 8 May, the Office of the State Pathologist formally advised the South South West Hospital Group that future State post-mortems would be performed at alternative venues, pending the building of a new mortuary at UHW. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific queries with respect to the figures in the graph provided in the response to Parliamentary Question No. 232 of 14 May 2019, as these are operational issues, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. It is a matter for both local Consultants and hospital management to determine whether there have been any adverse impacts on the delivery of mortuary services and to respond to those in accordance with the HSE Incident Management Framework. </p>  <p>  It has been agreed that an independent review of the mortuary at University Hospital Waterford will be conducted to examine internal processes and pathways and management and governance arrangements to ensure that they are consistent with contemporary practice. A review team and terms of reference have been agreed. The HSE has advised that the Review Team is working towards the completion of a Final Report in September.</p></reply>

When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p><p>A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p><p>The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialities, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology.</p><p>In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>The data requested by the deputy is outlined in the documents in the following link.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-04a.615.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070400063#WRL02800"><p>I refer to the Parliamentary Question No. 244 for written answer on 2<sup>nd</sup>April 2019. A holding reply had issued to the PQ at the time and I had undertaken to obtain the outstanding information for the Deputy from the State Claims Agency (SCA), which manages claims in relation to clinical negligence.  Due to an administrative oversight, my Department had not issued the information which had been received from the State Claims Agency. I apologise to the Deputy for this oversight. The response to the Deputy's question is now set out below.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's reference in his question concerning  missed diagnosis, it is important to note that a screening test is not a diagnostic test. Cervical screening aims to prevent cervical cancer through the early detection and treatment of pre-cancerous changes on the cervix. Earlier detection can often increase treatment options, as well as reduce the invasiveness of that treatment. It is estimated that regular cervical screening can prevent 75% (or 3 out of 4) of cervical cancer cases. Since 2008, 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck. More than 50,000 women with high grade abnormalities (CIN 2 &amp;amp; 3) have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer. CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland - these dropped from around 14 per 100,000 in the period 2009-2011 to 10 per 100,000 in the period 2013-2015.  Cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer, and some women will still develop cervical cancer despite regular screening.</p><p>Also, I would like to clarify matters regarding the Deputy's reference to alleged failings in the cervical cancer screening programme. It should be noted that the Report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, conducted by Dr Gabriel Scally, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected.</p><p>However, Dr Scally was clear in his Final Report, published in September 2018, that the Inquiry was satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck. His report presented no evidence that either the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme.  Dr Scally also confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.</p><p>In response to the Deputy's question relating to the number of claims on hand in this regard, I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that the information set out below has been extracted from the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and is correct as at 30th March 2019:</p><p><b><i>1. Number of Claims on hand:</i></b><i>There are currently 98 claims relating to allegations of misinterpretation of slides by the National Screening Service under active management by the State Claims Agency.</i></p><p><b><i>2. Number of Claims Settled:</i></b><i>To date the SCA has settled 4 of these claims.</i></p><p><b><i>3. Amount paid out in claims to date:</i></b><i>Due to the low volume of claims paid out to date, the SCA is unable to provide this figure as it could lead to the identification of an individual.</i></p><p><b><i>4. Legal costs of the cases:</i></b><i>In respect of all associated National Screening Services cases, legal costs amounting to &euro;590,583 have been paid.  These legal costs include fees paid to mediation services, which is consistent with the SCA&rsquo;s policy of using mediation wherever possible to resolve these claims in a non-adversarial manner that does not add to the considerable pain and trauma of the people affected and their families.  These legal fees also include matters not relating to the areas in which the State has already accepted liability.  It is anticipated that much of the work carried out in respect of these initial cases, and by extension the fees incurred, will be applied in resolving future cases that have been notified to the SCA and that this work will not need to be repeated in managing these future cases.</i></p><p>For clarity, I would ask the Deputy to note that the settlements outlined above were agreed with the laboratories, and the amounts were paid by the laboratories.</p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p>  <p>  The HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017. For the first five months of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital EDs increased by 4.9%, and the number of ED admissions increased by 3.3% compared to the same period last year. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group.</p>  <p>  However, the National Service Plan 2019 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department are discharged or admitted within 24 hours. Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question the Deputy has asked, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly.</p></reply>

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling</p>  <p>  waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019 and the NTPF will arrange 25,000 hospital operations and procedures at a value of &euro;58 million. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific matter raised, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Irish forests are currently estimated to sequester 3.8Mt of Co2 per year.</p>  <p>  On average, a productive hectare of spruce forest may sequester 10 tonnes of CO2 per year over a 35 year period. This would mean 1,000 hectares of spruce would sequester 10,000 tonnes per year or at least 350,000 tonnes over its lifetime.</p>  <p>  The rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. My Department has funded a number of large scale research projects which have examined carbon stocks and stock changes in Irish forests. For example, the carbon stocks in a Sitka spruce forest and an ash forest at different ages have been measured and are available in the following published journal articles:</p>  <p>  Wellock, M.L., Rafique, R., LaPerle, C.M., Peichl, M. and Kiely, G., 2013. Changes in ecosystem carbon stocks in a grassland ash (Fraxinus excelsior) afforestation chronosequence in Ireland. Journal of Plant Ecology, 7(5), pp.429-438</p>  <p>  Black, K., Byrne, K.A., Mencuccini, M., Tobin, B., Nieuwenhuis, M., Reidy, B., Bolger, T., Saiz, G., Green, C., Farrell, E.T. and Osborne, B., 2009. Carbon stock and stock changes across a Sitka spruce chronosequence on surface-water gley soils. Forestry, 82(3), pp.255-272</p>  <p>  This work found that after forty-seven years, an ash forest and Sitka spruce forests had 177.8 and 376.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare respectively. However, these figures are specific to the forests and soils examined and cannot be used to reflect all forests of these species.</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the new forestry module on the Carbon Navigator which is being developed by Teagasc and An Bord Bia.  This tool will describe indicative carbon stocks in a range of forest types.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p>  <p>  My Department takes any allegations of breaches of animal welfare rules very seriously and will thoroughly investigate and take the necessary enforcement actions to deal with such offences.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the greyhound sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times and the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed by the President on the 28th   May 2019. This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability and welfare.</p>  <p>  In recent days, Bord na gCon has published the first steps of their Action Plan to strengthen the traceability, re-homing and welfare standards by improved regulation, more inspections and the use of greater resources in these areas.  Minister of State Andrew Doyle will be meeting with the Board of  Bord na gCon this week to discuss these issues and other measures that may be required to bring about comprehensive change in the sector.  In addition, I will press for the swift implementation of their action plan, with a view to identifying what further tangible measures are required to address the issues of serious public concern raised in this Programme. </p></reply>

The staff resources available for this work is a Senior Research Officer with an annual salary of &euro;98k, a Research Officer with an annual salary of &euro;76k and two laboratory attendants with an average annual salary of &euro;28k each.  None of these staff are in receipt of a driving allowance.</p><p>The operational cost, excluding salaries and overheads, for Pathology Division of which Dublin RVL is a component but which also includes clinical microbiology, histopathology, the TSE National Reference Laboratory, biochemistry and toxicology is approximately &euro;500k per annum. This relates specifically to the supply of laboratory consumables, equipment maintenance and proficiency testing.  </p><p>Since 2017, farmers from Dublin and surrounding counties who contact the Department seeking to book in ruminant carcases for post-mortem examination have been advised to avail of the services provided by either Kilkenny or Athlone RVLs.  However, it should be noted that over that time, while Dublin RVL has focussed on providing a diagnostic service to the pig and poultry sectors, no farmers who have presented themselves at Backweston have been turned away or refused a service.</p><p>Details of the number of carcasses submitted to Dublin RVL (Backweston) from 2015 to date is provided in the table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of carcasses submitted at Backweston laboratories</th></tr><tr><td>2019 to date</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>629</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1,072</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,700</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,803</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This new facility will provide my Department with a suitable space within which any exotic virus of farmed animals can be safely and effectively handled. </p>  <p>  Therefore, Ireland will be entirely self-sufficient in respect of laboratory diagnosis in the event of an outbreak of an exotic viral disease and will no longer be reliant on our counterparts in the UK.  The total cost of these amelioration works, the ancillary works that were required on a heat treatment plant and the associated consultancy fees was &euro;7.5 million.  Commissioning of the new laboratory has commenced.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with this, the High Containment Laboratory team is in the process of moving all of its exotic disease diagnostics operations into the new laboratory on a phased basis. This will ensure continuity of service and is in line with best international practice in bio-containment of the high risk agents involved (all of which are exotic to Ireland). Commissioning and relocation will be completed over the next few months. </p></reply>

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  My Department takes any allegations of breaches of animal welfare rules very seriously and will thoroughly investigate and take the necessary enforcement actions to deal with such offences.  </p>  <p> It is worth noting that the greyhound sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times and the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed by the President on the 28th   May 2019. This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability and welfare.</p>  <p>  In recent days, Bord na gCon has published the first steps of their Action Plan to strengthen the traceability, re-homing and welfare standards by improved regulation, more inspections and the use of greater resources in these areas.  Minister of State Andrew Doyle will be meeting with the Board of  Bord na gCon this week to discuss these issues and other measures that may be required to bring about comprehensive change in the sector.  In addition, I will press for the swift implementation of their action plan, with a view to identifying what further tangible measures are required to address the issues of serious public concern raised in this Programme. </p></reply>

EU Regulations pertaining to the National Reserve provide that the two categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; must receive priority access to the Reserve.  In the context of the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, Ireland consulted with the EU Commission regarding the possibility of including the Forgotten Farmer group under the specific disadvantage category of the 2017 National Reserve. The EU Commission confirmed that Member States could not use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve.  </p><p>The Commission confirmed at the time that the only funding option for the specific disadvantage category was natural replenishment of the Reserve, such as from unused entitlements or the proceeds of clawback, but only after the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; had been catered for.</p><p>EU Regulation 2393/2017 (Omnibus Regulation) came into effect in January 2018 and introduced a new possibility for the inclusion of &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories such as Forgotten Farmers into the National Reserve. From 2018, Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories of the Reserve, but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; in that particular year.  As there was sufficient funding available in the National Reserve in 2018 and 2019 from natural replenishment of the fund in order to cater for the two priority categories, the issue of a linear cut did not arise. </p><p>Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the main farming organisations, farm advisory and education services.</p></reply>
