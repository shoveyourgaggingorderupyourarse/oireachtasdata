This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across over fifty different information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included Radio, newspaper and social elements.</p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>Campaigns have achieved impressive audience reach across all media platforms. The #AntiViral Campaign had over 5.7 million impressions by mid-December 2020 &ndash; we had communicated with over 300,000 young people approximately 5 times across the platforms building awareness of the Campaign. The AntiViral hashtag had over 1.1 million views and the Campaign&rsquo;s positive sentiment was measured at over 60%.</p><p>Data from 25 of the Campaigns advertised in National press show an average reach of 49%, with 17 of these reaching over 50%. The average readership for the 25 campaigns was 1.9 million (with 16 of the 25 campaigns having a readership of over 2 million). Readership figures for regional newspapers is over 1.5 million for each campaign.</p><p>Radio advertising had an average audience reach of 79%, with 19 of the campaigns advertised on radio reaching over 80%. </p><p>Digital display advertising was used in 13 campaigns, with a combined audience reach of over 33 million. This is an average of 2.6 million impressions, with six of the campaigns reaching over 3 million citizens.</p><p>Of 19 campaigns analysed that used Social media advertising, an average of 4.9 million impressions were achieved, with a high of 16.1 million impressions for the Publication of the Roadmap campaign.</p></reply>

We are integrating climate action into all aspects of the Department and its agencies&rsquo; activities. </p><p>New jobs will emerge in the green economy in sectors such as renewable energies, environmental consultancy services, residential and commercial retrofitting and low carbon technology installation and electric vehicle infrastructure.  In order to maximise these opportunities, continuous pre-emptive workforce development is required.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has undertaken an analysis of the &ldquo;Skills to Enable the Low Carbon Economy to 2030&rdquo;. This forthcoming report provides vital input on the demand for, and nature of, the skills required to facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy. We are now working to disseminate its findings and advance these recommendations with stakeholders, to ensure the delivery of identified skills needs. </p><p>My department is also facilitating a drive toward the green economy through its agencies. Earlier this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a pilot Climate Enterprise Action Fund to assist Irish companies to build the capabilities required to deliver sustainable products, services and business models. Under the National Recovery and Resilience Fund, this programme will be expanded until 2025.</p><p>IDA Ireland has developed and published a new strategy Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 which includes a sustainability pillar and offers clients incentives for sustainability projects, including R&amp;amp;D grants for large scale multi-year projects where companies look to develop next-generation technologies within the sphere of the Green Economy. This places a focus on sustainability in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s corporate strategy including winning FDI from the world&rsquo;s leading companies across all areas of the Green Economy. EI will also set out actions to embed sustainability and climate action as a fundamental part of its approach to company development and engagement with client companies in the context of their forthcoming Strategy.</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland is involved in the drive towards a green economy which includes, for example, establishing and enhancing standards for retrofitting, publishing recommendations for the design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of solar PV panels and details on heat pump requirements.</p><p>This work will present opportunities for developing and growing the green economy while also assisting in our transition to a low carbon sustainable economy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-20a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021102000069#WRB01000"><p>As set out in the Programme for Government, this Government is committed to reform of the insurance sector.  Recognising that delivering change in this area requires action across Government Departments, Government established the Sub-group on Insurance Reform under the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment. The Sub-group, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed. This work is driven by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, the next meeting of which  will be convening this week to review progress to date and consider progress of the remaining actions  in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Among the actions completed are the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which came into effect on the 24th of April. Since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 40% with 71% of awards now &euro;15,000 or less compared to 30% of PIAB awards in 2020. Although Government will continue to monitor the      situation closely, the new Guidelines clearly represent a significant shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance costs. </p>  <p>  With regard to actions under my Department, as Minister of State with responsibility for PIAB I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering. I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 was signed into law in June 2021 and commenced on 28 July 2021.  The legislation provides a clear definition of perjury and should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts. </p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a coordinated Government policy approach to increasing competition in the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  The scope of the National Claims Information Database has been widened to cover Employer Liability and Public Liability with a first report published by the Central Bank in July.</p>  <p>  While progress on these actions is welcome, Government is committed to doing more to reduce insurance costs. The Minister for Justice is considering legislative proposals to reform the law in the area of occupier&rsquo;s liability. Under the Action Plan, the Department of Justice is working on several actions in the area of fraud. We will also enhance the National Claims Information Database. Ministers and I have met regularly with stakeholders to understand the issues they face and to inform our policy making process. This engagement will continue as we deliver meaningful reform of the insurance sector.</p></reply>

I propose to take Questions Nos  71 and  72 together.</p><p>The carbon tax is one of many policies in place that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The Oireachtas has legislated, through the 2020 Finance Act, to progressively increase the rate of carbon tax each year so that it will reach a rate of &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The increase in the rate by &euro;7.50 in Budget 2022 brings the overall rate to &euro;41 per tonne. The increase applied from 13 October 2021 for diesel and petrol, and will apply from 1 May 2022 for all other fuels to allow for the winter heating season.</p><p>A predictable schedule of carbon tax increases, in conjunction with other measures such as investment in active mobility and energy efficiency measures, and a progressive replacement of the private car fleet to electric vehicles, will allow households and businesses to plan for increases in carbon tax and, over time, this will change consumption and investment decisions.</p><p>On foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, the ESRI published a report entitled, &quot;Carbon taxes, poverty and compensation options,&quot; on 13 October 2020. The report identified a series of targeted direct social protection payment interventions that could be used to address the effects an increase in the price of fossil fuels would have on lower income households and examined the effect of each of these. This report subsequently informed the introduction of a number of social welfare measures in Budget 2021 designed to mitigate the impact of increasing the rates of carbon tax on lower income households. </p><p>This year&rsquo;s carbon tax increase was again accompanied by a series of parallel measures, introduced by the Minister for Social Protection in Budget 2022, intended to assist low-income households:  </p><p>- an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12, and &euro;3 per week for children over 12; </p><p>- an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week;  </p><p>- an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week; and </p><p>- an increase in the income threshold for the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week.</p><p>My Department defines energy poverty as an inability to heat or power a home to an adequate degree. It is currently measured as a requirement to spend more than 10% of a household&rsquo;s income on energy needs, which is an accepted and recognised method of assessing the likely level of energy poverty. The ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and again in 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. </p><p>While the ESRI report referred to above updates the measurement of energy poverty to 2020 levels, it did not specifically link this measurement to a proposed approach for the redistribution of carbon tax revenues. Instead the report noted that, due to difficulties with measuring energy poverty with accuracy, there is a compelling case for focusing on the net impact of any rise in the carbon tax on more established measures of poverty, such as the official at risk-of-poverty rate. The report shows that by doing this it is possible to raise the carbon tax while reducing poverty in general. It is important to note that the ESRI has also previously found that energy poverty and poverty in general are closely linked in Ireland and, that by targeting supports towards those at risk of poverty, it is likely that those in energy poverty are also supported. In line with this, Government supports for those at risk of energy poverty focus on both income supports and energy efficiency upgrades. Free energy efficiency upgrades are only available to those in receipt of certain welfare payments and those living in social housing, meaning that the support is targeted to lower income households. A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s international supply chains are similarly challenged.</p><p>In relation to shipping, shipping costs across the globe have risen considerably. This is largely attributed to the disruption caused to the global supply chains by the COVID-19 pandemic. On a more local level, the end of the Brexit transition also represented an inevitable disruption to normal trade flows as businesses adjust to the effect of the UK becoming a third country.</p><p>In the first half of 2021, the volume of goods traded globally increased significantly as economies reopened. Surging demand coupled with moderate supply growth caused upward pressure on shipping charter rates. The surging demand was evident on all major containership routes. Disruption to supply lines during initial waves of the pandemic has meant that capacity in the containership industry has not kept pace with demand, driving shipping charter rates upward.</p><p>Within the aviation sector, cargo-only flights continued to operate during COVID but the grounding of the majority of scheduled passenger services, with the consequential loss of bellyhold capacity, had a significant impact on the price of air cargo. I expect to see a phased reintroduction of a number of European routes from Dublin towards year-end. Together with the impending relaxation of US travel restrictions, we should see an increase in capacity for belly hold air cargo over the coming months.</p><p>In the road haulage sector, the demand for use of the UK landbridge for accessing EU markets has fallen considerably as a result of Brexit. This has driven the simultaneous decline in Ireland-GB traffic and an increase in direct Ireland-EU traffic. However, land borders across the EU remain fully open and no delays, outside of the norm, are being seen.</p><p>There is however a shortage of HGV drivers. This is not an issue confined to Ireland, but has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for number of years. It has been exacerbated in an Irish context by COVID and Brexit. Both the Irish Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association of Ireland have informed my Department that Irish road transport operators are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain qualified HGV drivers from Irish labour supply and from abroad.</p><p>Overall, like many countries across the EU and globally, Ireland&rsquo;s supply chain remains under considerable strain. In terms of mitigating actions, my Department has and continues to meet with stakeholders from the shipping, aviation, haulage and exporter associations in relation to the range of issues they are experiencing, and rapidly responding to, due to Covid and Brexit. In relation to shipping supply lines, the Irish Maritime Development Office continues to monitor maritime traffic, trade and the global shipping market data.</p><p>In aviation, as part of Budget 2022, the Government announced a substantial aviation package of &euro;90m to be used by state airports to further incentivise the restoration of connectivity and associated bellyhold capacity.</p><p>In response to HGV driver shortages, a National Logistics and Supply Chain<b></b>Skills Group is in place since 2019 and various actions have already been taken by the Group in collaboration with the industry to promote the training opportunities available. In addition, Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton has asked the  Group to examine the driver shortage problem and to make recommendations for mitigation. A number of interim actions are already being progressed including the acceleration of HGV driver licence exchange agreements with additional non-EEA countries.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Decarbonisation of heavy-duty vehicles will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  To promote the decarbonisation of the  heavy-duty sector, my Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme on 15 March 2021.The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains. To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the enterprise applying for the grant.</p>  <p>  &euro;2m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, my Department allocated an additional &euro;1m in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility. Funds for 2021 have now been fully allocated however the scheme will continue in 2022 with further funding available. Details on how to apply for funding in January 2022 will be available shortly.</p></reply>

At the core of these measures is identifying and targeting the smuggling of illicit tobacco products into the State, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. In that context, I am aware that Revenue monitors trends in the illicit tobacco trade on an ongoing basis and adjusts its actions and redeploys its resources in response to new developments or methodologies employed by the criminal gangs involved in that trade.</p>  <p>  Revenue has achieved considerable success in tackling the illicit tobacco trade. In 2020, it seized 48.2 million cigarettes valued at &euro;32.8 million. In the same year, it obtained 35 summary and one indictable conviction relating to the sale of illicit tobacco, with fines of &euro;83,500 imposed. In addition, there were 8 convictions relating to tobacco smuggling in 2020, 4 of which were on indictment, with fines of &euro;10,000 imposed. </p>  <p>  To the end of September 2021, Revenue seized 42.4m cigarettes valued at &euro;30m. In addition, it obtained 22 summary convictions relating to the sale of illicit tobacco with fines of &euro;51,750 imposed, and 8 summary tobacco smuggling convictions with fines of &euro;20,000 imposed. </p>  <p>  The smuggling of tobacco products is an illegal transnational activity.  The production and distribution of illicit cigarettes crosses international boundaries. In response Revenue, in conjunction with national and international partners, undertake a programme of activity to counter those involved in such illegal activity. Considerable success has been achieved internationally as a result of the Revenue programme of work in this area. In June 2021, Revenue identified illicit movements of raw tobacco and engaged in international operations that led to the seizure of 6.5 tonnes of tobacco in Glasgow and the identification and dismantling of a counterfeit hand-rolling tobacco factory in Stoke-on-Trent.  In July 2021, as a result of a significant operation between Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), an illicit cigarette manufacturing facility was identified in Northern Ireland, leading to the seizure of 1.6 million cigarettes and 11 tonnes of tobacco along with non-tobacco materials used in the manufacturing process.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue engages in joint operations with international partners, including OLAF (the EU&rsquo;s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation in countering the activities of those involved in the illicit international tobacco trade.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue is very conscious of the threat that tobacco smuggling poses to health, to legitimate business interests and to the Exchequer. I commend Revenue and all the relevant State agencies for their work in this important area and I am satisfied that there is an appropriate focus on tackling this form of criminality.</p></reply>

The Directive defines and classifies various manufactured tobacco products according to their characteristics and lays down the relevant minimum rates of excise duty for the different types of products. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and a high level of health protection.</p>  <p>  Every four years, the European Commission is required to submit a report to the Council on the rates and the structure of excise duties, accompanied &ndash; where appropriate &ndash; by a proposal for the revision of the Directive. The latest report was prepared by the Commission on 10 February 2020 and on 2 June 2020 the Council approved conclusions setting out its priorities in relation to the review of the Directive. A public consultation, open between 30 March 2021 and 22 June 2021, sought to ensure that all relevant stakeholders had an opportunity to express their views on the current rules and on possible changes to these rules. The Commission is expected to bring forward a new legislative proposal later this year or early in 2022 and the impact of this can be assessed when the proposal is available.</p>  <p>  The Commission Report and the Council conclude that it is necessary to upgrade the EU regulatory framework, in order to tackle current and future challenges in respect of the functioning of the internal market by harmonising definitions and tax treatment of novel products (such as liquids for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products), including products that substitute tobacco, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and regulatory disparities in the EU. Revision can also address the issue of tax-induced substitution across products and enable further measures to combat the illicit trade in tobacco to address tax control, revenue collection and health protection issues.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the review of the Directive to ensure that the rules remain fit for purpose, safeguard the proper functioning of the internal market and, very importantly, provide for a high level of health protection. This latter point is particularly significant in the context of the plan in the Programme for Government to introduce a targeted taxation regime to specifically discourage &lsquo;vaping&rsquo; and e-cigarettes as well as in the European Action Plan against Cancer and our own national policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, both of which recognise that taxation plays a pivotal role in reducing tobacco consumption, in particular in deterring youth from smoking. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to a policy of high taxation of tobacco to encourage people to quit smoking. Government health and social policy has focused on the further denormalisation of smoking generally as consumption of tobacco products remains one of the greatest avoidable and preventable health risks in our society. Similar considerations arise in respect of e-cigarette products and other alternative products. </p></reply>

It sets out the categories of alcohol and alcoholic beverages that fall within scope of taxation and the basis on which excise duties on such products are to be established. Council Directive 2020/1151 amends Directive 92/83/EEC and includes a new Article 13a which allows Member States the option to grant up to 50% excise relief to independent small producers of fermented beverages such as cider. The amendments to the Directive do not take effect until 1 January 2022. Therefore, I am not in a position to introduce any excise relief measures for small producers of fermented beverages such as cider until after this date. </p>  <p>  Up until this point, it has not been possible to offer reduced rates to small producers of cider, in the same way as applies to small producers of beer, as the application of Article 4 of the Directive is restricted to beer. Ireland is not an outlier, as other Member States have been in the same position. Ireland fully supported the introduction of amendments to the Directive to allow Member States introduce excise reliefs for small producers of cider. As I outlined in my Budget Speech last week, I see the introduction of such a relief as having a similar positive effect as that provided for small independent producers of beer. </p>  <p>  The new Article 13a is structured differently to what is permitted under Article 4. Therefore, the existing relief in Irish legislation for beer could not be simply extended to cider.  It will be necessary to provide a separate new relief, which would be similar in concept but different in detail. While this measure will be broadly modelled on the existing relief arrangements for beer, further considerations will need to be given to ensure clarity in relation to scope of the relief and also to its design and implementation so as to minimise the administrative burden and any compliance risks. My Department is considering these matters further and will engage with the sector and with the Revenue Commissioners over the coming months. As I indicated in the Budget, I plan to bring forward the relevant legislative amendments in Finance Bill 2022.</p></reply>

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provided for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021, ensuring that the scheme continues to provide ongoing and necessary employment support for eligible businesses as the economy returns to a full re-opening.   In my Budget Day announcement, I confirmed that the scheme would continue to operate in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. </p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The employer can self-assess for EWSS eligibility on the basis that there has been at least a 30% reduction in the turnover of the business or customer orders. I have been advised by Revenue that if a reduction in customer orders is the basis to determine eligibility, as a transport operator, the business must demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in the following:</p>  <p>  - the volume of online bookings for passenger journeys; or </p>  <p>  - the number of passenger journeys; or </p>  <p>  - the value of passenger ticket sales.</p>  <p>  Where a reduction in turnover is the basis to determine eligibility, when undertaking a review of the potential reduction in turnover, employers need to include all sources of trade income specifically including sales, donations, State funding, etc. This would include income from fares, Free Travel Schemes and potentially NTA funding support. However, the treatment of Government grants and public funding for the purposes of determining a reduction in turnover is dependent on the nature of the grant or funding arrangement. In reviewing their eligibility, employers should consider the specific nature and terms of the funding arrangement having regard to the applicable accounting standards and required recognition treatment of such grants or public funding arrangements.</p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an EWSS Eligibility Review Form through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue is necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th of the following month.  </p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme. This, together with Revenue&rsquo;s EWSS ongoing real-time compliance program, will reduce the possibility of employers, inadvertently or incorrectly, claiming EWSS amounts to which they are not entitled and having to subsequently repay those amounts to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Any employers who have queries relating to the EWSS eligibility criteria should contact the Revenue office that deals with their tax affairs for assistance.  In addition, detailed information relating to amounts to be included in the calculation of turnover for EWSS purposes is set out in Revenue&rsquo;s published eligibility guidelines which can be found at: www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/documents/ewss/ewss-guidelines.pdf.</p></reply>

The measures set out in the strategy, together with the associated timeframes for delivery, represent the current actions for priority attention in order to increase the supply of residential property.</p>  <p>  Having said this, the Deputy will be aware of the Living City Initiative (LCI). The LCI is specifically aimed at the regeneration of the historic inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. The scheme provides income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in refurbishing/converting of qualifying buildings, including for residential purposes, which are located within pre-determined 'Special Regeneration Areas' (SRAs).</p>  <p>  There are three types of relief available:</p>  <p>  - Owner-occupier residential relief;</p>  <p>  - Rented residential relief; and,</p>  <p>  - Commercial/Retail relief. </p>  <p>  In 2016 officials from my Department reviewed the measure in consultation with the relevant councils and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective. The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who may now claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes. </p>  <p>  In relation to property-based reliefs more generally, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. In line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose is required. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. The primary responsibility for direct expenditure based policy in this area lies with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in this sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-20a.112.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021102000070#WRE03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 91 and 92 together.</p>  <p>Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax.  As such, for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; of 2022 to 2025, it is a matter for residential property owners themselves to determine the market value of their property as at 1 November 2021, calculate the LPT due and submit an LPT Return to Revenue by 7 November 2021.  This is the case regardless of whether a property owner has received a formal notification from Revenue or not.</p>  <p>  However, I am advised that Revenue has issued over 1.4 million notices to property owners, setting out what is required to meet Local Property Tax (LPT) obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;. This includes approximately 200,000 hard-copy LPT returns to property owners who have not previously availed of the online options and may not be able to avail of, access or use the LPT online services. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks, Revenue has commenced a comprehensive LPT media campaign, highlighting the obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; and the assistance available to enable property owners to fulfil their LPT obligations. Revenue spokespeople have taken part in several national and local media interviews and continue to do so. The LPT media campaign will continue over the coming weeks, in the lead up to the 7 November filing date, using both print and digital channels. I am also advised that Revenue has actively engaged with various representative groups to further enhance the public communications campaign.</p>  <p>  The Revenue website includes a dedicated page outlining what property owners are required to do for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;. When determining the market value of a property for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;, property owners can use online sources, such as the Revenue interactive valuation tool, which can be found on the Revenue website.  Other online sources include the Residential Property Price Register or property sales websites such as daft.ie and myhome.ie.</p>  <p>  Where property owners cannot use these online facilities to value their properties, sources such as the property pages in newspapers (local and/or national) or checking the information displayed in local auctioneer offices can provide useful guidance.  Property owners are not required to determine an exact valuation of their property, they are only required to value their properties within a &lsquo;valuation band&rsquo;.  There are 20 valuation bands, the first band is &euro;0 - &euro;200,000, the second band is &euro;200,001 - &euro;262,500 and all other valuation bands are &euro;87,500 wide.</p>  <p>  To assist property owners who may be experiencing difficulties meeting their Return filing obligations Revenue is operating an LPT Helpline (01-7383626), which operates from 9.30am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday. Property owners who have not received a notice from Revenue, or a hard-copy LPT Return and are unable to file online should contact the Helpline for assistance.</p>  <p>  As part of the service the Helpline agents will assist with both the Return filing and payment selection processes. In advance of calling the Helpline, property owners will need to have determined the market value of their property so that the Return can be completed. They should also have their PPSN, Property ID and PIN to hand. The Property ID and PIN numbers can be found on any LPT correspondence previously received from Revenue. </p>  <p>  In relation to the deferral of any LPT obligations, the LPT regime includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer (50%), payment of the tax in certain circumstances. These circumstances include income level, hardship and personal insolvency. They do not include the circumstances the Deputy has referred to in Question No. 51611/21, i.e. where a person was unaware of their obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;.  A liable person must make a claim for a payment deferral in writing to Revenue setting out his or her personal circumstances.  Comprehensive information on the deferral arrangements are set out on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-20a.118.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021102000070#WRE03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Prior to 2000, income tax allowed for full joint assessment of married couples.  This meant that the earner in a single income couple could use the combined tax credits and standard rate band available to both individuals &ndash; i.e. double the personal tax credit and rate band available to a single earner.  As a result, where the primary earner of a couple had sufficient income to use the available reliefs in full, the second earner faced the marginal rate of tax from the first pound of income earned, which acted as a disincentive to workforce participation for second earners.</p><p>A process of moving towards an individualised system of income taxation began in the tax year 2000/2001 with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax. Many European countries have made similar moves towards a partial or fully individualised income taxation system on the grounds that it improves equality and economic independence for women. </p><p>Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed. The result is that we now have a hybrid system. Up to &euro;9,000 of the standard-rate band can be transferred between spouses and the married personal tax credit, can be allocated in full to one spouse. Because the income tax system allows married couples to choose whether to be jointly or individually assessed, there can be a difference between the tax liabilities incurred by married couples on the same household income, depending on the method of assessment chosen. </p><p>However, in lieu of fully transferable rate bands, a Home Carer Tax Credit may be claimed where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for a dependent person, such as a child. This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. </p><p>I would make the point that when looking at an issue such as individualisation there are a number of perspectives to consider, for example, on the one hand the points raised by the Deputy and also on the other hand the implications for labour force participation, in particular in respect of female participation in the labour market. There are of course other non-tax factors that also have significant impacts on female workforce participation, including the cost of childcare. </p><p>My Department keeps the issue of individualisation of the income tax bands under review.Most recently, the matter was considered in 2019 as part of the Tax Strategy Group deliberations ahead of Budget 2020.However, I have no immediate plans to revisit issue.</p><p><b>Tax Code</b></p><p>The Tax Code sets out the basis on which an individual is assessed to tax and provides for a significant number of credits, reliefs and exemptions, eligibility for which is subject to a wide range of conditions. While the basis of assessment and the credits, reliefs and exemptions available vary depending on the facts and circumstances applicable in each specific case, there is no discrimination in the Tax Code.</p><p>Basis of Assessment</p><p>Parts 44 and 44A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provide for joint assessment of a married couple or civil partners who live together. Where joint assessment applies, the couple are chargeable to tax on their combined total income. The couple may however apply to be assessed to tax separately, meaning that each individual is taxed as if he or she were not married or in a civil partnership. The couple may choose whichever basis of assessment is most beneficial to them, based on their personal circumstances. </p><p>Standard Rate Band</p><p>Section 15 of the TCA 1997 provides for the standard rate band, i.e. how much of an individual&rsquo;s income is liable to tax at 20%. For the 2021 year of assessment, the standard rate band is &euro;35,300 per person. In the case of a married couple or civil partner, each individual is entitled to a standard rate band of &euro;35,300. </p><p>If the couple is jointly assessed to tax and either spouse or civil partner has insufficient income to fully utilise his or her own standard rate band, he or she may transfer a portion of their unused rate band to their spouse or civil partner. The maximum portion of the standard rate band which one spouse or civil partner may transfer to the other is &euro;9,000 and any excess unused rate band above this amount cannot be transferred. This is the case irrespective of whether the couple has one or two incomes.</p><p>Tax Credits, Reliefs and Exemptions</p><p>Part 15 of the TCA 1997 provides for a wide range of tax credits, reliefs and exemptions. Whether or not such credits, reliefs and exemptions are available to an individual or couple depends on the circumstances of the specific case and the eligibility criteria for the individual credit, relief or exemption. </p><p>One such credit is the basic personal tax credit, which is provided for in section 461 of the TCA 1997. For the 2021 year of assessment, the basic personal tax credit is valued at &euro;1,650 per person. In the case of a married couple or civil partnership, each spouse or civil partner will be entitled to his or her own basic personal tax credit of &euro;1,650. Again, this is the case irrespective of whether the couple has one or two incomes.</p><p>The home carer tax credit of &euro;1,600 is available to married couples or civil partners that are jointly assessed, where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to take care of a dependent person. The carer may earn up to &euro;7,200 per year without affecting the amount of the credit awarded. Where the carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;7,200, the amount of credit available is reduced by one half of the excess over &euro;7,200, subject to a maximum income limit of &euro;10,400. </p><p>Further information on the above may be accessed at the following links:</p><p>- Revenue website - www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/marital-status/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/index.aspx </p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 44-01-01 - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-44/44-01-01.pdf.</p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-29 - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-29.pdf </p></reply>

If the nature of the question is clarified, a further reply can be provided directly.</p>  <p>  The details supplied to this parliamentary question also makes reference to a media article from 2020. Mr David Tynan of PwC was appointed to the role of Assessor pursuant to the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 in November 2018.   </p>  <p>  The Assessor's report was published on the Department of Finance website on 12 May 2020 and the overall conclusion of this report is that the fair and reasonable aggregate value of the transferred shares and the extinguished rights in the bank as at 15 January 2009 for the purposes of payment of fair and reasonable compensation for the acquisition of those shares and the extinction of those rights was nil and therefore, that no compensation is payable to former shareholders of any class or to former rights holders. </p>  <p>  The Assessor was appointed pursuant to the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 (the "Act"). Under the Act the Assessor is required to determine this value having regard to the following items:</p>  <p>  - on the basis of the true financial state of Anglo Irish Bank on 15 January 2009, taking into account the underlying market values of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s assets and the extent of its actual, contingent and prospective liabilities on that date;</p>  <p>  - having regard to the rights attaching to each class of transferred shares; and</p>  <p>  - assuming that no financial assistance, investment or guarantee (other than the guarantee already provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008) would in future be provided to or made in Anglo Irish Bank, directly or indirectly, by the State.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Anglo Irish Bank Assessor states that, in his opinion, absent the provision of recapitalisation funds from the Government that the former Anglo Irish Bank was unlikely to be able to continue to trade as it was "both cashflow and balance sheet insolvent", as at 15 January 2009. </p>  <p>  The Project Atlas October 2008 report, which PwC prepared, was based on Anglo&rsquo;s IFRS balance sheet as at 30 September 2008 which was after the Government bank guarantee.  The report stated that the balance sheet showed that the bank&rsquo;s assets exceeded its liabilities. </p>  <p>  I note that the work conducted by the Assessor cannot be compared to the reports undertaken by PwC under Project Atlas given the different dates involved and the fact the Assessor's report was conducted on the assumption of no further future support being provided to the bank (in line with the requirements of the Act).</p></reply>

Allocations of this level would result in a reduction in the poverty rate and could leave the  lowest two income deciles better off than before the increase. </p>  <p>  In light of the ESRI research and the commitment to ensure that the carbon tax is progressive,  the Government has committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social  protection supports in Budget 2022. These supports were selected to counteract the impact of  the increased carbon tax on low income households. The specific measures are: </p>  <p>  - An increase to the a Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12  and &euro;3 per week for children over 12 - This protects low income families and will reduce  child poverty; </p>  <p>  - An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week - People living alone are  often the elderly most at risk of poverty or people suffering from a disability. These groups  are likely to have higher energy needs than average;  </p>  <p>  - An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week - This will compensate a broad  range of lower income households (since the Fuel Allowance is means-tested) for the  additional energy costs they are likely to incur due to an increase in the carbon tax. This  will be combined with a broadening of the threshold for Fuel Allowance eligibility and an  increase in the income allowed for the means test that is applied to applicants; </p>  <p>  - An increase in the income threshold for the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per  week &ndash; Research has found that children in energy poverty have a greater likelihood of  respiratory illness. Using carbon tax funds to compensate low paid employees with  children will lead to improved health outcomes, particularly when combined with the  qualifying child payment. </p>  <p>  The total cost of these interventions is projected at &euro;146m in 2022. This will be funded by the  additional carbon tax funds of &euro;105m that have been allocated to the Department of Social  Protection, with the remaining &euro;41m cost met by the Exchequer. This allocation is nearly triple the level of expenditure recommended by the ESRI to ensure that that carbon tax increase is progressive. </p>  <p>  Analysis undertaken in my Department before the publication of Budget 2022 using SWITCH, the ESRI tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of  the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package estimates that the net impact of  the combined measures is progressive. Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all  of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a  result of these measures. This is a tangible demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to  achieving a Just Transition.</p></reply>

The carrying out of a material change of use from holiday home to a place of permanent residence without obtaining planning permission could be considered unauthorised development and subject to enforcement proceedings by the relevant planning authority under planning legislation.</p>  <p>  If the owner of a holiday home wishes for the premises to be used as place of permanent residence, then they may lodge a planning application to the relevant planning authority for a change of use from holiday home to residential use.  It is a matter for the planning authority to decide such applications on a case by case basis. When considering an application for planning permission for residential development or change of use, the planning authority is required to consider the local housing needs requirements policy as set out in the authority's Development Plan.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that holiday homes are often located in more remote areas and/or may be on land which is specially zoned for such development in the Development Plan and/or Local Area Plan, e.g. a &ldquo;resort&rdquo; zoning, and which therefore may not be suitable for permanent residential development. Different design layouts and standards may also be applied to holiday homes than to permanent residential development and the planning authority&rsquo;s policies on rural housing may also apply differently to holiday homes than to permanent residential development, all of which the planning authority would have to consider when making a decision on a change of use application. Consequently, a proposal to change a holiday home to permanent residential housing could be found to be contrary to the principles of proper planning and sustainable development of the area in question.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the existing provisions in this regard at this point in time.</p></reply>

In the case of a teacher wishing to avail of a Career Break to undertake voluntary service abroad/missionary/diplomatic/military/Oireachtas or study leave this requirement will be waived.&rsquo;</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools.</p>  <p>  This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index.</p>  <p>  This work involved an initial process of consultation by my Department with the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. Over the coming weeks there will be further consultation with relevant stakeholders to outline the components of the model. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.</p>  <p>  The costing of DEIS supports vary from school to school depending on enrolment and the profile of a given school. A definitive breakdown of the numbers of schools to be supported will not be available until the current phase of work is completed.</p>  <p>  The full list of supports available to DEIS schools is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Supporting-Information/Supports-to-DEIS-Schools.html </p></reply>

The additional hours must be used in the course of the 2021/22 school year.  Guidance has also been provided for schools in relation to how the additional teaching hours should be best used as well as details of appropriate control and oversight measures required in schools. </p>  <p>  With regard to the psychological services to our schools, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) model is one where there is a balance between consultation and casework about individual children, and support and development work with school personnel. The NEPS model does not operate on a waiting lists basis. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  Under the Special Education Teacher allocation model, a NEPS assessment is not required for students to access learning supports. </p>  <p>  The capacity of NEPS was increased as part of a package of measures to support the reopening of schools when the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced, bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole time equivalent psychologist posts.  </p></reply>

Where students require more specialised interventions, a continuum of education provision extends to include access to special school or special class places, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  This continuum extends from fulltime placement in mainstream classes to full time enrolment in special schools with a number of options in between including access to a range of additional supports and for those children whose assessment of need includes a recommendation, access to special class provision. This is to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.</p>  <p>  My Department supports this continuum through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child.   These supports include the provision of teachers, special needs assistants and psychological support from the National Psychological Service. </p>  <p>  In addition, there are specialist supports provided by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The Council has published Guidelines for Setting Up and Organising Special Classes for Primary and Post-Primary Schools. The guidelines advise that students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes, to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities. The Council provides extensive professional development programmes for teachers and advice for schools, parents and families.</p>  <p>  Currently, my Department&rsquo;s budget for special education exceeds &euro;2bn which funds the costs of over 14,000 special education teachers and over 19,000 SNAs which supports a broad continuum of education for children with special needs. </p>  <p>  ASD early intervention special classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school. Following early intervention, children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class or a placement in a special school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published transitional guidelines for children with special needs. These wide-ranging and comprehensive guidelines provide advice and tips for parents, students and schools covering the transitions between all stages of education, these Guidelines are available at www.ncse.ie</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of SNAs, the NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs and for advising on the education provision for children nationwide, including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools   </p>  <p>  Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, for registration purposes as set out Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council reviewed its policy on standards of ITE programmes and published an updated document C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education in November 2020. As part of the review, the previous sixteen mandatory elements for all programmes of ITE have been updated and amalgamated into seven core elements, one of which is: Inclusive Education.</p>  <p>  Inclusive Education has been strengthened in C&eacute;im and is described as &lsquo;any aspect of teachers&rsquo; learning aimed at improving their capacity to address and respond to the diversity of learners&rsquo; needs.</p>  <p>  All new Primary and Post-primary programmes submitted to the Council for accreditation must now be in alignment with C&eacute;im. Existing programmes of ITE shall be realigned in accordance with C&eacute;im for commencement in September 2022 for first year student teachers.</p>  <p>  The NCSE provides a range of professional development programmes for teachers and advisory supports for schools in the area of supporting children with special educational needs.  Information on these is available directly from the NCSE.</p></reply>

In the 2020/2021 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  In addition all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and who have applied and paid on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. This latter arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Planning for school transport for the 2021/22 school year has proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as term began in this new school year. This includes the recommendations from Public Health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity. All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students are also in place.  However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Should post-primary services resume operating at 100% capacity and  where additional vehicles that were provided for social distancing purposes are removed, any spare capacity available will be offered on those services to concessionary pupils or late applicants where such capacity exists.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  The current SPHE/RSE curriculum at both primary and post primary facilities teaching and learning about consent. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe Programme has been introduced and is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme. The primary SPHE programme as a whole is also due to be updated by the NCCA as part of the work resulting from the NCCA&rsquo;s review of RSE provision in schools.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, two programmes are in place which come under the heading of Personal Safety. One of these programmes is for junior cycle which addresses personal safety in relationships and explores topics such as healthy and unhealthy relationships, consent and domestic gender-based and sexual violence. The other programme, which is for senior cycle, addresses topics such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, dating violence and rape. Both of these programmes were designed by the Professional Development Support Service (PDST) and are intended to be taught as part of the wider SPHE/RSE curriculum. Professional development support is available to teachers, directly linked to these resources. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.</p>  <p>   In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA on 11th of December, 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) have now been published.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits will be expanded during 2021-2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  It is expected that public consultation on the draft updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification will begin in early 2022.</p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of consent education and naming consent within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships.</p>  <p>  In addition to developing updated curricula and support materials the NCCA will contribute to facilitating interagency collaboration and linkages between the formal and non-formal education sector to enhance the sharing of expertise, learning and resources related to RSE. The NCCA will also initiate networking between groups/agencies working to support schools on targeted initiatives, such as consent and LGBTQI+ issues.</p></reply>

Note that this includes credited contributions and Home Caring Periods, if these were used in calculating the pension rate. </p><p>- Once a person qualifies for the maximum rate of State Pension, it is not necessary to add further information to the Department's systems in relation to pre-1979 history, credited contributions and Home Caring Periods.  This means that some people's social insurance records may in fact have been stronger than shown above.</p><p>- In April 2012, the minimum level of paid contributions required to qualify for the State Pension increased from 5 years (260 contributions) to 10 years (520 contributions).</p><p>- Self-Employed social insurance contributions commenced in 1988. By 2013, those who were in full time self-employment since 1988 had accrued 1300 paid contributions.

This is a necessary step to ensure equity of treatment and fairness within the social welfare system with those who lost their jobs pre-pandemic and indeed those who have lost their job since 8 July when the PUP scheme closed to new applicants.</p><p>In view of the approach being taken by Government, I have already deferred the process of moving from the lower &euro;203 rate of PUP to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, which was due to begin in early September, until after 26th October. Accordingly, affected customers will continue to receive their PUP payment until 26 October when the process of their transition to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will begin.

There is a range of benefits available to people who make Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme.</p><p>A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  A means test establishes if a claimant has enough financial resources to support themselves and determines what amount of social assistance payment, if any, for which they qualify.</p><p>This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.</p><p>Cash/income that is assessed as part of the means test includes any income from employment or self-employment (and that of their spouse/partner, if applicable), income from a social security pension from another country and maintenance payments.</p><p>Capital assessed as part of the means test includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares, as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  Property personally used or the claimant&rsquo;s home is never assessed as part of the means test, regardless of who is the legal owner.</p><p>Disability Allowance (DA) is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p><p>The DA income disregard allows claimants to earn up to &euro;140 per week from employment or self-employment without their payment being affected. Weekly earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50% (that is 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded).  100% of earnings above &euro;350 are assessed as means. An increase of &euro;25 per week to the upper disregards was introduced in Budget 2022. This means that from June 2022 only earnings above &euro;375 per week will be assessed at 100%.  The income disregard aims to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in work while retaining a proportion of their social welfare payment.</p><p>The DA capital disregard allows for people to have capital to a certain level without their payment being affected. The table below sets out  the formula used for determining weekly means from capital for DA.</p><p>Table: Weekly means formula for capital, Disability Allowance. <table>    <tr>       <th>Formula </th>       <th>Weekly Means</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First &euro;50,000</td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Next &euro;10,000</td>       <td>&euro;1 per   &euro;1,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Next &euro;10,000</td>       <td>&euro;2 per   &euro;1,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Excess of   &euro;70,000</td>       <td>&euro;4 per   &euro;1,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Earlier this year, I introduced a new income disregard for Disability Allowance recipients who have been granted bursaries, stipends or scholarships towards completing a PhD.  The disregard is subject to an annual limit of &euro;20,000 per annum (i.e. if a recipient gets more than one bursary, the combination cannot exceed &euro;20,000). This disregard is available for a maximum of four years. Budget 2022 saw the eligibility for this disregard expanded to recipients of the Blind Pension.</p><p>Social insurance payments for those unable to work due to illness or disability include Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension. Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are 'permanently incapable of work' because of illness or disability.  </p><p>The Department also provides the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme for those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  This scheme includes Exceptional Needs Payments, Urgent Needs Payments and SWA Supplements (heat, travel and dietary supplements). These means tested payments may be made to help meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  Details and eligibility criteria of the scheme are available at </p><p>The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives - while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

Young jobseekers on an age-related reduced rate will receive the full &euro;5 increase in their rate.</p>  <p>  In addition to a general rate increase, I have provided for targeted increases in payments. This will ensure that resources are focused, in the most effective way possible, to those with limited means, who are more at risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  For example, social welfare recipients with children will see further increases of &euro;2 per week in respect of each child aged under 12, and &euro;3 per week in respect of children aged 12 or over.   </p>  <p>  Pensioners and people with disabilities who are living alone will see their weekly Living Alone Allowance increase by a further &euro;3, while all Fuel Allowance recipients will see a &euro;5 weekly increase during the fuel season.</p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, which will be introduced in addition to the &euro;5 increase to core rates, a pensioner or person with a disability receiving fuel allowance, and who is living alone, will see an increase of &euro;13 per week during the fuel season, while a lone parent with two children aged under 12 will see their weekly payment increase by &euro;14 per week during the fuel season. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the total social welfare budget package of &euro;558.3 million has been designed to  protect the most vulnerable in society.  In addition to the general &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, it targets measures for those most likely to be financially vulnerable so that it delivers a real increase in their weekly income in 2022.</p></reply>

These include education, employment, work training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and chaplaincy services, some of which are intended to provide purposeful activity while in custody and to encourage and equip individuals to lead law-abiding lives on release. </p><p>Prisoner services are provided through a blend of different methods of service delivery with some services, such as Psychology, Work and Training; Chaplaincy and Healthcare provided by staff directly employed by the Prison Service. Other services such as Probation Service, Education and Mental Health Services are provided by staff from other statutory organisations. </p><p>Services such as drug addiction and resettlement services are provided to the Prison Service by organisations contracted for that purpose. </p><p>These services are available to all prisoners in all locations. Due to the varied nature of service delivery the Irish Prison Service does not record centralised data on prisoner who have engaged with one or all of these service providers. </p><p>To provide data on the number of inmates who have engaged with these support services between 2016 and 2020, would require a manual examination of a large number of individual prisoner records. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort, which could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources. </p><p>However I am advised that the Prison Service are currently reviewing all of the information they gather in order to improve data analysis and reporting.  This restructuring of data will facilitate more timely and accurate provision of structured data and information requests going forward.</p><p>The costs associated with the provision of prisoner servicers are published annually in the annual Appropriate Accounts.  The costs for the provision of Prisoner Services and Education Services is set out in the table below. The Prison Services category includes expenditure for Medical Care and for Work Training but also includes expenditure for - Prisoner Catering Service; Prisoner Clothing and Toiletries; Prisoner Bedding, Furniture &amp;amp; TV's; Cleaning &amp;amp; Laundry Services and Gratuities.</p><p><b>Table 1 </b></p><p><b>Total expenditure Prisoner Services and Educational Services for the period 2016 to 2020.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Source:   Vote21 IPS</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Appropriation   Accounts</td>       <td>&euro;'000</td>       <td>&euro;'000</td>       <td>&euro;'000</td>       <td>&euro;'000</td>       <td>&euro;'000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.4.

These locations allow the proposed structure to be trialled in a high population density area, a medium population density area and a low population density area, with a regional distribution. The pilots are subject to independent evaluation, with learning outcomes taken into account in the drafting of the statutory framework for community safety and applied to the national roll out of similar partnerships in communities across the country.</p>  <p>  Membership of these Local Community Safety Partnerships includes representatives from relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and councillors as well as residents and community groups, representatives of youth, new communities and the voluntary, business and education sectors.</p>  <p>  The pilots are each chaired by an independent chairperson and each pilot is also supported by a dedicated staff member - the local community safety coordinator - whose role is to support the Partnership, engage the residents in the community on safety issues and link them in with the work of the Partnership.</p>  <p>  Each of the pilots will receive funding for the provision of administrative support to undertake the work of the pilots. The Dublin pilot will receive funding of &euro;345,000 over 24 months in partnership between my Department, NEIC and Dublin City Council. The Waterford and Longford Pilots will receive funding through Dormant Accounts Funding of &euro;245,000 each for 24 months. </p>  <p>  Each Local Community Safety Partnership will develop a Local Community Safety Plan which will identify actions and the Department or Agency with responsibility for fulfilling these actions. Support to implement these actions will come from existing budget allocations. </p>  <p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships may also apply for funding for additional community safety interventions through the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, the establishment of which is provided for in Budget 2022. It is intended that this fund will support investment in projects which will improve community safety. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m. </p>  <p>  A call for funding proposals will issue seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, such as the new Local Community Safety Partnerships and the Drogheda Implementation Board, as well as similar entities nationwide. </p>  <p>  Applications will be assessed against stated criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best. These criteria for allocating funding are currently under consideration and will be announced in due course.  </p>  <p>  The approach we are taking will ensure that the best proposals to improve community safety will get the funding they need and will encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best. It will also allow best practice on community safety to be shared with other partnerships around the country as new proposals get developed.</p></reply>

My Department is providing  &euro;148,041 in funding to Victim Support at Court (V-SAC) in 2021.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;4.9m is being allocated to Victims of Crime under Budget 2022. This increase in funding will ensure that court accompaniment related supports funded by my Department are available to all categories of victims of crime throughout the State.</p>  <p>  My Department is also reviewing the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services to identify where gaps exist and how to bridge them. This piece of work will be completed shortly. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be interested to know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently has 28 Victim Service Offices, one in each operational Garda Division. These offices ensure victims of crime are kept informed about the progress of their case and the supports available to them. </p>  <p>  Staff of these offices are the central point of contact for victims and are responsible for communicating with victims and prioritising their needs. </p>  <p>  They supplement victim support activity already being undertaken by investigating Garda&iacute; in the local Victim Service Office. </p>  <p>  The Garda Victim Liaison Office is part of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau. It is responsible for developing and reviewing Garda policies on victim related issues and for supporting the implementation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Victims Charter.  </p>  <p>  The Office also engages with government funded victim support organisations, as well as with criminal justice and other state agencies, on ways to improve services to victims of crime. It also provides support to the Family Liaison Officers who are appointed to help and support victims of crime and their families in serious cases. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also provide a victim liaison service. A victim of crime, a member of their family, or a third party person acting on their behalf can register with he Victim Liaison Office in the IPS in order to be kept informed of significant developments in the sentence management of a prisoner.  </p>  <p>  Victims registered with the Service are provided with information on when the offender will be released from prison and about any form of temporary release. They are also informed about inter-prison transfers, hospital appointments and court appearances. Victims are also provided with information regarding an escape from custody, as well as being notified about an upcoming Parole Hearing and the outcome of it. </p>  <p>  The Victim Liaison Officer can also provide victims with general information about the prison system, such as the regime in different prisons, remission on sentences and the operation of the Parole Board. The Officer deals with victims on a strictly confidential basis. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the Victim Liaison Service is a voluntary service. It is a matter for the victim or their families to choose if they want to receive information about a prisoner. They can register with the service at any stage during the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence and can also change their mind and "opt-out" of the service at any time.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Both these actions are key deliverables in the Justice Plan 2021. </p><p>The audit was published in July of this year. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I agreed, in line with its key recommendations, that the Department of Justice will continue to have lead policy responsibility for DSGBV. We also recognise that the policy and operational responses of a number of other Ministers and agencies will continue to be crucial in meeting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle all forms of DSGBV.</p><p>My Department is leading the development across Government of the new DSGBV national strategy which will place a priority on prevention and reduction. It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and aims to radically improve services and supports for victims. The strategy is on track to be developed in consultation with all relevant Departments and stakeholders with a view to it coming to Government for approval before the end of 2021.</p><p>The new strategy will build on the experience of the last two strategies, the learning from the priority given to this work during the pandemic and the commitment and expertise of all bodies involved. The audit outcome, the current review of accommodation needs undertaken by Tusla together with the ongoing work of implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey, will also feed into the new strategy.</p><p>It is my intention to have a draft strategy ready for a further round of public consultation in the coming weeks.</p><p>Progress is continuing to be made on delivering the recommendations arising out of the O'Malley Review, as set out in Supporting A Victims Journey. A number of important actions have already been delivered and work to progress the remaining actions is being treated as a priority by all those responsible for their delivery. When completed, this work will ensure victims have confidence that the criminal justice system will support them, keep them informed and treat them with respect and dignity at every stage of their journey through it.</p><p>The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to my Department for this. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable us to roll out specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also allow us to provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes and it will support a number of front line activities. </p><p>As part of this, an additional &euro;1.1m will be used to put in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence and &euro;1 million is being provided to the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims. </p><p>The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p><p>Furthermore, I<b></b>understand that Minister O'Gorman has secured an increase of &euro;41m for Tusla under Budget 2022 which includes the budget for funding organisations that deliver frontline services, including the funding of refuge spaces. </p><p>Since 2014, this part of Tusla's budget has almost doubled from &euro;17.5m to &euro;30m in 2021. While I understand Minister O'Gorman, in consultation with Tusla, is finalising the detailed allocation of funding resources to various programmes and service areas, I am assured that the budget for 2022 will allow Tusla to maintain supports for DSGBV services, which have seen a significant increases in demand in the context of Covid-19, and to progress recommendations emerging from its review of refuge accommodation provision.</p></reply>

As per Garda  policy and procedures, 999/112 emergency calls for service are recorded and retained for a period of seven years. I am further informed that recorded call data can be extracted and stored separately for the purpose of specific investigations when required. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I consider any inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls a very serious matter. This falls significantly below the high standards that the public expect from the Garda&iacute; and the high standards that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na set for themselves. I am particularly concerned that anyone experiencing domestic abuse, or indeed anyone in a vulnerable position, who summoned the courage to seek assistance may not have received it.  </p><p>The Policing Authority was asked by Minister McEntee to oversee the review being carried by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to this matter, and there have been a number of engagements between the Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since March of this year.  </p><p>I share the Authority and the Commissioner's concern about the continuation of what appear to be inappropriate cancellation and classification of calls since the introduction of the new procedures. These circumstances will of course be considered by the Authority as part of their continuing oversight of the Garda review of this matter, and will be taken into account in the work being carried out by an external policing expert who has been appointed to assist the Authority in this task. I await the outcome of the Authority's work in this regard.</p><p>I will of course consider any recommendations the Authority choses to make regarding the future management of these matters.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>On the 7<sup>th</sup>October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. </p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) collect, collate and publish waiting lists in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient/daycase procedures. Waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however, it is not possible for the NTPF to identify patients based on their clinical diagnosis.</p><p>The attached document details the outpatient waiting list for Neurology in University Hospital Limerick by area of residence.  The number of patients waiting longer than the national guidelines would be a service/clinical matter and I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly on this as soon as possible.</p><p>/ie/oireachtas/debateRecord/dail/2021-10-20/supportingDoc/2021-10-20_pq220-19-10_en.xlsx>Grants</p></reply>

Fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose because there is no specific test and the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. Treatment often requires interventions from various medical specialists for management of symptoms as they arise. Fibromyalgia is not classified as a disability and there are currently no plans for its reclassification. </p><p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p><p>In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the Long Term Illness Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p><p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The Scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. </p><p>In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p><p>In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.</p><p>An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.</p><p>The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p><p>Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p><p>Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year.</p><p>CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients.</p><p>CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p><p>A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme.</p><p>Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p><p>In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, as this is an operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is an over-arching cross-departmental policy that has influenced policy and service delivery across Government since inception.</p>  <p>  Significant developments have been, and continue to be, made in promoting positive ageing since the Strategy launched in 2013.  In relation to the Programme for Government commitment to an age friendly Ireland progress is being made on commitments to increase home and community supports and housing options for older people. In particular, Sl&aacute;intecare which envisages older people being supported to live well in their own homes for as long as possible sets out an overarching vision for care in our community and enabling older people to live longer at home. New projects such as the Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme, the establishment of a Statutory Home Support Scheme, Integrated Care Packages for Older People (ICPOP) are just some examples of the progress we are making across government, agencies and with stakeholders in the community to increase the positive experience of ageing. The establishment of Age Friendly Ireland as a shared service for older people nationally is a further significant achievement.</p>  <p>  Since the National Positive Ageing Strategy my Department has developed a significant body of research to inform an evidence based approach to policy making for older people in partnership with the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and the research initiative set up on foot of the Positive Ageing Strategy i.e. HaPAI. </p>  <p>  Across Government we will continue to prioritise improvements for older people in Ireland by focusing on the effective implementation and delivery of outcomes envisaged in Sl&aacute;intecare, Housing For All and other focused strategies such as the National Dementia Strategy.</p></reply>

Treatment often requires interventions from various medical specialists for management of symptoms as they arise. Fibromyalgia is not classified as a disability and there are currently no plans for its reclassification. </p><p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p><p>Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p><p>In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the Long Term Illness Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p><p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The Scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. </p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. </p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:</p><p>- vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p><p>- boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. </p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.  </p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support is scheduled to commence in November 2021 in CHO 8  (Longford / West Meath).  Recruitment issues associated with backfilling of posts has impacted on release of interRAI Care Coordinators in CHO 2 (Galway), 4 (South Lee) and 7 (Dublin West). This has necessitated phased introduction of pilot sites however it is expected that all will be fully operational by January 2022. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to inform legislative and funding decisions in relation to the statutory home support scheme. </p>  <p>  130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs and recruitment for these posts is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This additional allocation will be maintained in 2022. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.  Data which has been provided since the cyber-attack is provisional and subject to change.  At the end of August 2021, the preliminary data indicates that about 13.2 million home support hours had been provided to 53,905 people. This is about 2 million more hours compared to the same period last year. </p></reply>

This includes contraceptive injections, implants, various types of intrauterine system (IUS) or device (IUD; commonly known as the coil), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill.</p><p>As noted by the Report of the Working Group on Contraception, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the justifications for the phased and incremental introduction of free contraception are based on the differential barriers faced in accessing the most effective forms of contraception by different age cohorts, and likely supply-side constraints.</p><p>The initiative is gradually being introduced by age cohort, starting with younger women who are least likely to be financially independent and where cost has been shown to be a greater barrier to accessing the most effective forms of contraception, long acting, reversible contraception, or LARCs.</p><p>The Report advises that an issue highlighted by both the research review, and by many stakeholders, is a possible lack of capacity to deliver some forms of contraception. Many forms of LARC require specialised certification and training in terms of fitting and removal. The costs of prescription contraception medications and/or medical devices are currently covered under the GMS scheme, for those holding a medical card, while clinical costs are covered under both the medical and GP visit cards.</p><p>However, for private patients, the up-front costs of various LARCs were estimated by the Report at &euro;250 - &euro;350 in 2018-2019; with the majority of stakeholders reporting this as a barrier to access, particularly for younger women. The removal of cost barriers is almost certainly going to increase demand for these services.</p><p>In developing the scheme, this has been taken into account and funding has been provided in Budget 2022 for training and certification of additional GPs to fit LARCs,. However, this upskilling is likely to take time, hence the adoption of a phased approach to implementation, as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Providing free contraception to the age cohort of 17-24 year old women was one of the recommended options in the Report. This was extended to 17-25 in the Program for Government and this is the rationale for the initial rollout announced in Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The Department also plays an active role in developing Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to EU discussions on FTA negotiations, including at the EU Trade Policy Committee. </p><p>In situations where the EU is proposing to increase EU market access for agri-food products, including for beef, we use our influence to minimise the quantity of tariff rate quotas provided for.

Nevertheless, I am very well aware of the concerns in relation to the licensing of peat extraction which are generating challenges (volume and price) for the horticulture sector.</p><p>Malcolm Noonan T.D., Minister for Heritage and Electoral Reform in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, established a working group, which includes a representative from my Department, to address the key issues raised in a Report on the Review of the use of Peat Moss in the Horticultural Industry. A final report from this working group is expected imminently.</p><p>Separately, my Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date. Furthermore, the Department&rsquo;s Research Call for 2021 included a call for further research on alternatives to peat based growing media for horticultural production.</p><p>Given the Department&rsquo;s areas of responsibility and recognising the importance of the horticulture sector to the economy, my Department continues to provide sustained and significant support to the sector through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Horticulture Sector. </p><p>Additionally, fruit and vegetable growers who are members of recognised Producer Organisations (POs) can access EU funding up to 50% of the eligible costs of approved Operational Programmes through the EU&rsquo;s PO scheme.</p><p>I continue to engage directly with the sector, most recently meeting with the mushroom industry on the issues they face. Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has responsibility for the sector, has ongoing engagement directly with the horticulture sector, and has responsibility for the sector, including in her capacity as co-chair of the Horticulture Industry Forum, across a range of issues, including peat use.</p></reply>

Food Vision provides a framework within which more detailed plans and processes on the wide range of issues facing the sector will be progressed and developed, overseen by an implementation committee. Some 200 actions under 22 goals are proposed, guided by four high-level missions:</p><p>1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector</p><p>2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being</p><p>3. Food that is safe, nutritious and appealing: trusted and valued at home and abroad</p><p>4. An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent. </p><p>Food Vision states that the tillage and horticulture sectors are the most carbon efficient sectors of Irish agriculture and it is important that the area under cultivation in these sectors is at least retained, with an ambition to increase both. </p><p>Although there is no specific target to increase tillage production, Food Vision 2030 acknowledges the importance of the tillage sector as it provides high quality grain to the animal feed industry, and straw for feeding and bedding, while also making a significant contribution to the food and drinks sectors in the form of malting barley, milling wheat and oats for the breakfast cereals industry. </p><p>Action 27 in Mission 2 (Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being) states that Stakeholders will work to develop the sector to take advantage of potential growth in: 1) high value output (malting barley, wheat, oats and rye) to distilling and brewing; 2) high value food markets such as oats (particularly organic oats), oils and salad &amp;amp; chipping potatoes; 3) meeting domestic protein crop demand for livestock diets. </p><p>The Department and I will continue to work with the sector and to provide supports as appropriate. The success of Food Vision 2030 will depend on effective implementation and oversight. For this reason, a Monitoring and Implementation Framework is included in the Strategy. This highlights areas for collaboration and partnership within the sector but also with key external stakeholders. </p></reply>

These strategies are coordinated and monitored by a High-Level Implementation Committee, which I chair, and which includes the Heads of the relevant State Agencies (Bord Bia, BIM, Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc), as well as representatives from relevant Government Departments.</p><p>On the question of a more formal review, it is anticipated that these will be undertaken as part of the periodic critical reviews of the State Agencies.</p></reply>

It provides small grants to community groups to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas.  Funding is provided to each Local Authority area, and administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs).  In May this year I launched the 2021 CEP with an allocation of &euro;4.5m.  The key theme was to support groups as they reopen facilities which were closed due to COVID-19.  The 2021 CEP is now closed, but it will re-open in due course and further information will be available from the LCDC in each area.</p><p>The following two schemes were also specifically referenced by the Deputy. </p><p>The <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme</b>provides funding to Local Development Companies across Ireland so that they can work with marginalised individuals and the groups that represent them. This programme has secured a 10% or &euro;4m budget increase in 2022, and the current iteration covers the period from 2018 to the end of 2023.</p><p>The <b>Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO)</b>provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national community and voluntary organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion and promoting equality.</p><p>The current three year scheme commenced on 1st July 2019 and will cease on 30th June 2022. A total of &euro;18.8 million has been allocated under the current scheme to a total of 74 organisations. It is expected that a new iteration of the scheme will commence in July 2022, further to an application process commencing in December 2021. Funding for the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO Scheme) will increase from &euro;5.9 million to &euro;6.7 million in 2022. </p><p>My Department also has many other schemes, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. I would also encourage interested parties, such as the bridge club referenced by the Deputy, to stay in touch with the Local Development Company and Local Authority in their area, so that they are aware of grant schemes from across Government Departments and state agencies, as they become available.</p></reply>

Development of annual work programmes allows for the review and revision of priorities contained in the measures for delivery over the lifetime of the policy.</p><p>The 2021 Work Programme, which was drafted in conjunction with relevant Departments, contains actions which advance the delivery of more than 80 per cent of commitments in the Policy.</p><p>My Department has begun preparations for the publication of the first Progress Report, which will be published at the end of this year in order to incorporate updates on all measures contained in the 2021 Work Programme. </p><p>Further Progress Reports will be produced every six months thereafter as per the commitment in the Policy. </p><p>While work on compiling the first Progress Report is ongoing, I am delighted with the level of activity across Government in recent months to deliver on the Policy&rsquo;s ambition.  This has seen investment provided for rural communities across a range of areas such as local transport and active travel, remote working facilities and digital connectivity, and huge levels of support for important projects under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Development Investment Programme.</p><p>We have also seen, for example, the launch of the agri-food strategy Food Vision 2030 and the Pathways to Work 2021-2025 Strategy, the publication of the Maritime Area Planning Bill and launch of the National Marine Planning Framework, and the formal establishment of Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest at the start of this month. The revised National Development Plan, published in recent weeks, also significantly reinforces the objectives of Our Rural Future.</p></reply>

Engagement between officials in my Department and in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is ongoing with proposals regarding the membership, structure and specific actions of the reconstituted Taskforce at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  The draft proposals for the reconstituted Taskforce set out an ambitious and impactful work programme. Focussing on actions that will deliver tangible and sustainable improvements in telecoms services for the public, it is intended that the new Taskforce will leverage the excellent progress made by its predecessor. As with the previous work programme, periodic reports on the Taskforce&rsquo;s activities will be disseminated online. </p>  <p>  Since the last formal meeting of the Taskforce in late 2019,  I and my officials, in addition to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and his officials, have continued to engage closely with all Taskforce members and interested stakeholders to ensure that the good work of the Taskforce continues and is built upon, for example via the continued operation of the Joint Utilities Local Authority User Forum which is the primary means of addressing issues between local authorities, utilities and industry and in relation to ensuring that licensing rules remain fit for purpose. The lines of communication between former Taskforce members remain open and productive and good progress has been made on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  The work of the reconvened Task Force will involve engagement with colleagues from across local and national government and with the telecoms sector via Ibec. These engagements will begin at the earliest opportunity with the intention of re-establishing, on a formal footing, the very productive relationships that have endured over recent years. </p></reply>
