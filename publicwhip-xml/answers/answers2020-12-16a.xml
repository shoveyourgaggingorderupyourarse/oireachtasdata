I raised the Finucane case with the Prime Minister and I restated the Government&rsquo;s position on the establishment of a public inquiry.  Previously, I met with Geraldine and John Finucane on Monday, 23 November to discuss their case and reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s support.  Following this meeting I wrote to the British Prime Minister about the case.</p><p>I am deeply disappointed that the UK Government has not committed to holding an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. The Government remains strongly of the view that a public inquiry is needed.</p><p>The decision is a further blow to Geraldine Finucane and her family, who have been pursuing truth and justice for three decades with great dignity.  I spoke with Geraldine Finucane on 1 December and made it clear to her and her family that the Irish Government will continue to work with them to ensure an independent public inquiry is eventually held.  </p><p>The Government will work with the Oireachtas collectively to articulate again the view that a full public inquiry must be held. </p><p>We will continue to work at both European and international level<font color="#004080"> </font>and we have bipartisan support in the United States from Congressman Richie Neal and Congressman Chris Smith.</p><p>Prime Minister Johnson and I also discussed latest developments on Covid-19 and the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the UK. I stressed that achieving a deal is in all our interests, but that time is tight. </p><p>We also discussed the forthcoming Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December.</p></reply>

Both of these reports were published by NESC in November, 2020.</p><p>The National Economic and Social Council is an independent statutory agency operating under the aegis of my Department.  </p><p>The Terms of Reference and composition of the NESC are set out in legislation - the National Economic and Social Development Act, 2006, and in the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order, 2010.</p><p>The role of the Council is to analyse and report to the Government on strategic policy issues relating to sustainable economic, social and environmental development in Ireland.</p><p>The Council can consider these matters either on its own initiative or at the request of the Taoiseach.  The Council&rsquo;s reports are then submitted to the Government prior to publication and may inform Government policy.</p><p>NESC Report No. 150 &ndash; Housing Policy Actions to Deliver Change - examines how to bring about the fundamental change required to move to a permanently affordable, stable and more sustainable system of housing. It focuses on two critical and deeply connected gaps: supply and affordability. </p><p>The publication <i>&ldquo;Position of the Self-Employed&rdquo;</i>is a background paper to NESC Report No. 151 &ndash; <i>The Future of the Welfare State</i>. It provides additional empirical and analytical material to the main report and outlines key challenges facing the economies and societies of welfare states in Europe and other developed countries. </p><p>Implementation of Government policy remains the responsibility of individual Departments. In the case of issues arising in these NESC reports this would be the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

They have missed out on many of the formative experiences, and rites of passage that so many of us have experienced - from the final year in school, to the Leaving Cert, to starting college, starting work and all that goes with that and much more.</p>  <p>  Their social lives and their social networks, which are so important to these groups, have been restricted. There have been some incidents of non-compliance involving young people, house parties etc, which have received a lot of focus and attention, especially on social media, over the course of the last number of months. </p>  <p>  Staff in GIS have been working (and continue to work with) other Government Departments, agencies and other groups such as Spun Out, and the USI, to understand how the pandemic has been affecting this cohort, their attitudes and the kind of communications that would resonate with this group. </p>  <p>  The evidence suggested that the majority of young people are complying with restrictions and are keen to continue to do so. The evidence also suggested that an effective approach would be to highlight the good work most young people have been doing, to acknowledge the efforts they have made and to create a forum or movement for young people to share their stories and accounts of how they are living their best lives possible within the guidelines. </p>  <p>  It was also felt that communications that were co-created and peer-led, using the platforms that this cohort preferred would resonate most.</p>  <p>  GIS, working with a creative agency partnered with a number of 'content creators' to create content and a forum on social media called #antiviral - using the hashtag young people are invited to share their stories and accounts of living in compliance with the restrictions. The content creators also canvassed their followers for questions which they put to the Acting Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn, this question and answer session is available on the website antiviralireland.com. The campaign is due to run until December 23 and will resume in January. </p>  <p>  The campaign is running on Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Youtube and has been performing very well with over 5.7 million impressions, over 160,000 engagements and 1.1 million TikTok hashtag views.</p>  <p>  While we must make sure that we don&rsquo;t become complacent, it is important to note that, as per NPHET update on 10th December, there has been a very significant decrease in incidence of the virus in the younger adult (19-24) age group in recent weeks.</p></reply>

This target will now be sent to the UN as the EU&rsquo;s Nationally Declared Contribution under the Paris Process.</p><p>We reiterated our condemnation of recent terrorist attacks in Europe and agreed on the need for ongoing cooperation to tackle terrorism and violent extremism both online and offline. </p><p>We emphasised the need for strengthened political dialogue with the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood. </p><p>We discussed Turkey&rsquo;s ongoing unauthorised drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean. We invited the Council to adopt further listings under the decision on sanctions of 11 November. We also agreed to return to this issue in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>We agreed on the importance of a strong strategic transatlantic partnership and looked forward to close cooperation on shared challenges.</p><p>We emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety of the Belarusian nuclear power plant at Ostrovets. We welcomed the adoption by Foreign Ministers of an EU global human rights sanctions regime. We also agreed that sanctions on Russia should be rolled over on 31 January. </p><p>On the morning of 11 December, President von der Leyen provided a brief update on the then state of play in the negotiations with the UK. </p><p>The meeting of the Euro Summit on 11 December was briefed on economic developments by President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, and Minister Paschal Donohoe, in his capacity of President of the Eurogroup. We also took stock of progress on banking and capital markets union and we welcomed the agreement reached in the Eurogroup on the reform of the European Stability Mechanism.</p></reply>

This provides an overview of reforms and policy actions underway in Ireland, including in response to Country Specific Recommendations given as part of the preceding year's European Semester.

The measures in place are published and regularly updated on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. </p>  <p>  It is a living document and Government has the ability to amend its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p>  <p>  These decisions are not taken lightly, and I am acutely conscious of the impact it is having on businesses. That is why since the beginning of the pandemic, the Government has provided a comprehensive range of measures for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. For a full list of supports for business please see my Department's website.</p></reply>

As such, the employees of Arcadia remain as employees and continue to have employment rights which they can exercise.</p><p>I extend my sympathies to the workers who are in danger of losing their jobs. I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved. </p><p>I understand that it is hoped to procure the sale of the Irish operations as part of an overall sale of the group and that the Irish stores will continue to trade through Christmas to maximise the value of stock. The Government hopes a suitable and sustainable buyer can be found, and that any potential job losses can be avoided. </p><p>Section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 makes it mandatory on employers to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of a proposed collective redundancy. To date none has been received in relation to Arcadia.</p><p>Redundancy is a matter for the employer in the first instance. The State will guarantee statutory employment rights to the workers. If necessary, the Social Insurance Fund, provides a safety net for employees to ensure they receive their statutory entitlements.</p><p>The Companies Act 2014 provides safeguards to ensure that a liquidation process complies with the relevant statutory requirements.</p><p>Workers also have rights as creditors under company law and they can execute their lawful rights through the courts.  They, or their representatives, can go to court on any question arising in the winding up of a company.  </p><p>Government will work in a coordinated way to support any person who loses their job.

Under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, the Border Enterprise Development Fund, the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme, and the Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme, Enterprise Ireland has invested over &euro;180 million in these infrastructures. Based on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s analysis, approximately 3,200 co-working/enterprise spaces are being developed across 45 of the 117 projects supported under these Funds.</p>  <p>  These facilities provide affordable physical workspace for businesses across the country, deliver training and soft supports to their tenants and other companies in their locality and regional area, and offer co-working facilities. </p>  <p>  To support enterprise centres impacted by COVID-19, Enterprise Ireland ran a &euro;12 million competitive fund to provide eligible enterprise centres with financial support for the implementation of a 6 to 12 - month Recovery Plan. On the 20th November, I announced &euro;8.24m in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres. The 95 enterprise centres, which are in every region of the country, will receive grants ranging from &euro;10k to &euro;150k.</p>  <p>  To build on the capacity of Enterprise Centres, Incubator Hubs and Shared Office Space to offer remote working facilities, a central objective of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional strategy, Powering the Regions, is the Worksmart Challenge. This challenge aims to support 10,000 co-working and incubation spaces regionally. </p>  <p>  There are a broad range of digital/enterprise/community hubs currently operating across the country, both publicly and privately funded, including social enterprises.  The Western Development Commission has mapped over 100 remote working hubs within the Atlantic Economic Corridor (AEC) region alone and aim to develop a network of facilities in the AEC region for remote workers, students and for community use.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that an Interdepartmental Working Group has been established to further develop a national network of remote working hubs and a senior official from my Department is a member of that Group.</p></reply>

I am committed to ensuring that the Government offers as much assistance as possible. A comprehensive range of measures is in place for firms of all sizes, including the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Government's Restart Grant and Restart Plus Grant of &euro;650m were specifically provided to ensure that businesses could access grant support to make necessary changes to premises to reopen safely. </p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Support Scheme was announced as part of Budget 2021. Changes were also made to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the EWSS, increasing the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, recently announced the doubling of the PUP threshold to &euro;960 over an eight-week period. This will help people to restart their businesses and allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners' COVID Restrictions Support Scheme offers a temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels by up to &euro;5,000 per week. For those that unfortunately have had to stay closed, including wet pubs, three double weeks of the CRSS will be paid because December is normally the busiest time of the year for these businesses.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 overall provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build resilience and help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p>  <p>  A six-month reduction in VAT rates down from 23% to 21%, and from 13.5% to 9% will benefit the hospitality sector. As well as a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my colleagues to monitor the schemes in place and to identify practical actions to help businesses.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which contains commitments aimed at facilitating remote work across Ireland. These include a mandate for public sector employers, colleges and other public bodies to move to 20% home and remote working in 2021 and the development of a National Remote Work Strategy.</p>  <p>  During the current COVID-19 pandemic my Department is closely following the guidance that all those who can work from home should do so. HR policies and practices for the Civil Service are governed centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). This includes matters relating to employment terms and conditions, including Circular 4 of 2003 which promotes e-working in the Civil Service. DPER is collaborating with all Departments to develop a policy on remote working and my Department is engaging positively to progress this work. </p>  <p>  In relation to the National Remote Work Strategy, my Department is leading on its delivery. The Strategy has been developed under the guidance of a broad Interdepartmental Group with representation across Government and the state agencies. The Strategy will consider what changes are needed to develop an environment that encourages remote working solutions. The Strategy will include a set of actions to be delivered and an Implementation Group will monitor the progress of these actions.  It is expected that the Strategy will be published shortly.</p></reply>

Its function is to add certainty to businesses that liquidity is available for working capital and investment purposes. Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to five and a half years.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees.</p><p>The Scheme was originally scheduled to run until 31 December 2020 in line with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework on State Aid.  Following the extension of the terms of this Framework Government approved, on 24 November, the extension of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to run until 30 June 2021.  It is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers.</p><p>As part of the Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework, each loan under the Scheme must have reduced interest rates. These are clearly articulated in the documentation businesses sign with their finance providers. </p><p>The Government will cover 80 percent of any claims under the scheme.  As per State Aid rules set by the European Commission, a premium must be paid to the Irish state which will alleviate some of the costs.</p><p>The CCGS has a draw down rate of on average &euro;8 million per week. This is close to guaranteeing in a week what was guaranteed in the full year of 2018 in the standard CGS.

The Country is, at present, at Level 3.  Under Level 3 restrictions no organised indoor gatherings (i.e. controlled environments with a named event organiser or owner or manager) should take place. While gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools can open they can only do so for the purposes of individual training, with protective measures in place. Also, since 1 December, changes have been made in respect of cinemas, galleries and museums over the Christmas period. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has no role in determining what businesses can open under any particular level of the Living with COVID-19 plan nor &ldquo;approving&rdquo; the re-opening of a business under any level. The role of Authority is as the lead Agency in co-ordinating inspections checking compliance with the Work Safely Protocol for those businesses that have re-opened in line with the different levels.</p>  <p>  I would add that any business can check the detailed guidance available on the Gov.ie website so as to determine which category which it falls into within the different levels.</p></reply>

Participation in these fora keeps me aware of the concerns and issues facing businesses as we navigate different levels of restrictions.</p>  <p>  My officials have assisted me and the Ministers of State in my Department in our engagement via these groups and in the design of grants or schemes to enable business manage the disruption imposed by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  This ongoing work includes examining what the impact of the current pandemic is having on the economy and on businesses, including the impact of the imposition of restrictions, including at Level 5.</p>  <p>  This involves utilising different data sources from the CSO, other Government Departments and higher frequency data from private businesses such as Google and Revolut. </p>  <p>  In particular, the numbers on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) published weekly by the Department of Social Protection is useful in determining the impact of restrictions at different levels.  The changes in numbers claiming the payment and the sectors they work in provides a good indication of the impact of restrictions imposed on employment and, by proxy, business. </p>  <p>  In addition, the data on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) provided by the Revenue Commissioners provides additional insight into the most highly impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  Complementing this official data, my officials have also used data from private sources such as Google, Apple, Revolut and OpenTable to highlight trends relating to consumer spending and the impact restrictions at different levels have had on sectors such as non-essential retail and the hospitality sectors.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client firms employed over 460,000 people at the start of this year and engagement between the agencies and their client firms is an important additional source of information for me and my Department on the impact of this pandemic and Government restrictions. </p>  <p>  All of these inputs and analysis feed into my thinking and help guide the Government's approach in regards to the level of restrictions which represents a balance between public health and economic considerations.</p></reply>

No. 126 of 2011, sets out the grounds by which a material which is recovered or recycled from waste can be deemed to be no longer a waste. As the designated competent authority, decisions regarding applications for end-of-waste status are the responsibility of the EPA and accordingly, questions in relation to specific applications are more appropriately directed to the Agency. Further information on the end of waste process is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website at www.epa.ie. </p><p>I am very conscious of the importance of the End of Waste in the transition to a more circular economy, in particular in relation to the construction sector.  The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy which I launched in September this year, has a dedicated chapter on End of Waste, and commits to a number of measures including:</p><p>- Working with stakeholders to streamline the process;</p><p>- Examining whether certain end of waste decisions should be determined by local authorities rather than the EPA;</p><p>- Establishing a working group to develop national end of waste applications for identified priority waste streams, which would obviate the need for individual applications within those streams; </p><p>- Introducing a fee for end-of-waste applications to help fund the process and encourage high quality applications.</p><p>My officials have already had initial engagement with regulatory authorities and with private sector stakeholders in relation to these measures, and will be working to advance progress in these areas over the coming months.</p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. </p><p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 10 December 2020, over 145,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.  Surveys have been completed in County Donegal in the areas of Milford, Letterkenny, Ramelton, Termon, Ballymacool, Kilmacrennan, Mullaghfin, and Tommyscroft.  My Department understands that NBI have targeted the following indicative dates for further surveying in Donegal within the next 18 months; <table>    <tr>       <th>Deployment Area </th>       <th>No. of premises  </th>       <th>Timelines</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Creeslough</td>       <td>3117</td>       <td>2021 Q3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tamney</td>       <td>1904</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rutland Island, Burtonport </td>       <td>7</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inishfree Island, Burtonport </td>       <td>21</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arranmore</td>       <td>470</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bunbeg</td>       <td>2360</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tory Island </td>       <td>113</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. I am advised that Letterkenny DA, which includes Ballymacool, Milford, Mullaghfin, Ramelton, Termon and Tommyscroft, is now at the detailed design stage.</p><p>  Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Donegal through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.  I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 3 December, 217  publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Ray Community Centre, Leghowney Community Centre, Dunree Military Museum, Cranford Coole Community Centre, the Gweedore Theatre and Meenreagh Hostel are BCPs which are now connected in Co. Donegal.  A further BCP at Tory Co-Op has had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. Further details can be found at <i></i>.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, it has been announced that an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has been agreed which will see almost 680 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, including 42 schools across County Donegal, which is well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.Further details are available on the NBI website at <i></i>.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November 2019 with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).</p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. It will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>  Further details are available on specific areas within Counties Westmeath and Longford through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 10 December 2020, over 145,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Surveys have been completed in County Westmeath in the areas of Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. Surveys have been completed in County Longford in the areas of  Drumlish, Ennybegs, Moat Farrell, Cullyfad, Longford Town, Newtownforbes, Cloondara, Stonepark, Ardagh, Moydow and Kilashee. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre to the home network to these premises, followed by pre build and build works. I understand that surveys are due to commence in the locations referred to by the Deputy between Q4 2021 and Q4 2022 and NBI will publish target build dates on completion of survey work. </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 4 December, 217 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education for schools. 59 publicly accessible BCPs across the country are now live. BCPs locations installed in Westmeath include Streete Parish Park and Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre and Ballycomoyle GAA Club which are due to be connected  in the coming months. BCP locations installed in Longford include Ballymore Shamrocks GAA Club, Mullinalaghta Community Centre, Colmcille GAA Club, Corlea Heritage Centre and Aughine Community Centre which are due to be connected in the coming months. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p><p>  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride in Co Westmeath is connected for educational access as part of this initiative. In Co Longford, Fermoyle National School is connected and Naomh Guasachta National School (Bunlahy) is due to be connected in the coming months. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has just  been announced which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-16a.115.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600094#WRC04200"><p>The Government is fully committed to supporting an expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network which stays ahead of demand over the coming years. My Department supports this commitment through relevant schemes such as those administered by the SEAI and an ESB project supported under the Climate Action Fund.</p>  <p>  There are currently circa 650 standard public charge points and over 100 fast charge stations in Ireland (the majority of which are operated by the ESB). An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status can be found at www.esb.ie/ecars.</p>  <p>  &euro;10 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>  The SEAI Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. In terms of cost to the Exchequer this scheme would potentially require in the region of &euro;4.5 million to support the installation of 900 charge points. However, overall costs for installing any given charge point will also be influenced by type of charger, location and scope of civil and electrical works to be carried out which can very significantly from site to site. It should also be noted that several private entities are operating in this space however information relating to the costs associated with these sites would be commercially sensitive and therefore not publically available. </p>  <p>  Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will be key in helping to sustain and  support the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cost effective form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department, administers an EV home charger grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. Again in terms of costs to Exchequer the cost of providing support to install 900 of these home chargers would be in the region of &euro;540,000 but again the full costs of installation will depend on location, type of charger being installed and specific site characteristics.</p></reply>

State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement schemes. In this context 12 regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP and the construction of a Distributor Road  to the south of Athy connecting to the N78 is one of those schemes.  </p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code and the terms and conditions applying to regional and local road grants, capital projects are subject to review and approval at a number of stages.  In this context Kildare County Council has submitted the contract documentation for the main Athy scheme construction contract to my Department for review.  </p>  <p>  The project will be subject to further consideration before a decision is made on whether the tender process proceeds.</p></reply>

However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  With respect to the issue highlighted in the question, I would first of all recommend that the individual in question ought to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover including flood insurance, at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.  In addition, the person has the right to make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.</p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - Investing almost &euro;1 billion to flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027. </p>  <p>  - Implementation of flood relief management plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW), and;   </p>  <p>  - Maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.</p>  <p>  The above approach is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland, who meet on a quarterly basis to help implement this initiative. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should in turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences.</p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the challenges of property insurance and flooding as part of the action points for my Department under the Climate Action Plan. Over the last year it launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties. The key themes that arose from the consultation related to (i) the lack of data on flood insurance coverage and (ii) the challenges of obtaining flood cover in areas with demountable defences. My Department is now meeting with key stakeholders such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the OPW, Irish Public Bodies, and the State Claims Agency to further review the issues raised and assess a feasible way forward.  This review is in progress and my Department will continue to provide updates on this work stream to the Climate Action Delivery Board.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to proactively engage on all aspects of insurance reform including flood insurance issues.</p></reply>

In fulfilling this sale function the lender is obliged, as far as is reasonably practicable, to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property.  </p><p>The decision to repossess a property as the result of a mortgage default is ultimately a commercial decision for the lender to make considering all the relevant factors, including that all legal requirements are met. For example, in the case of a mortgage secured on a Primary Dwelling House, the provisions of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears will apply and the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will have to be followed.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme, which was introduced in 2012, is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who are eligible for social housing support whose mortgage has been deemed unsustainable by their lender under the MARP and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves.  The scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body or Private Company to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender and which will also enable the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The scheme is part of the overall suite of social housing options and is an important part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, advises me that up to the end of November 2020, 884 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 884 households in the scheme represent 1,493 adults and 1,399 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1,296 active cases being progressed under the scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme commenced on 1 September 2020 and replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which ceased on 31 August 2020. </p>  <p>  The EWSS is different to the TWSS in that it provides a flat-rate payment to employers and requires a separate registration process because the eligibility criteria is different. Where an eligible employer wishes to avail of the EWSS it is very important that the registration process is completed before any application for payment is made. Where the registration process is not completed, an application for payment cannot be processed. It is also not possible to complete the registration process on a retrospective basis and payments are only processed on a prospective basis (once registration is completed). The only exception relates to July and August where &lsquo;sweepback&rsquo; payments were provided for.</p>  <p>  The organisation in question first registered for the EWSS on 5 October 2020 and has received payments from that date onwards. It was not possible for the organisation to access the system for September 2020 because it was not registered for the scheme at that time. Revenue has advised me that it will make contact with the organisation in the coming days to clarify how the EWSS operates.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that a list of sports bodies that have been granted an exemption is published on its website and Ballybunion Golf Club is on the list. On that basis, it does not qualify for CRSS. </p><p>An approved sports body is not exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) or payroll taxes and may be entitled to financial support under other measures put in place by the Government, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. </p><p>Details of CRSS were published in the Finance Bill 2020 and detailed operational guidelines on the scheme have been published on the Revenue website at:  .</p><p>The design and operation of CRSS is centred around the concept of the &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; to which access is restricted under the Covid-related public health Regulations. The Regulations apply on a geographical basis and the premises must be located in the relevant geographical area. </p><p>For the purposes of CRSS a business premises is defined in the legislation as being &ldquo;a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on&rdquo;.</p><p>The legislation further requires that &ldquo;applicable business restrictions provisions prohibit, or significantly restrict, members of the public from having access to the business premises in which the relevant business activity of the person is carried on&rdquo;. </p><p>Travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  It is also not sufficient that a business is experiencing a reduction in demand for its goods or services because of Covid-19. To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, a business must, under the specific terms of the regulations, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing its business premises.</p><p>The Deputies will appreciate that outdoor activity businesses, by their very nature, generally do not provide services in premises to which access is restricted. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CRSS and I have no plans to change this.</p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Decisions in this regard, including credit policies and decisions, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. The Relationship Framework for PTSB, the bank referred to by the Deputy, can be found at the following link:</p><p>Notwithstanding this, officials in the Department of Finance contacted the bank for a general comment on how they are managing the matter you have raised and were advised of the following:</p><p>&ldquo;Permanent TSB&rsquo;s credit policy does not differentiate between rural and urban locations when assessing a customer&rsquo;s affordability. In relation to Loan To Value requirements for rural apartments/duplex houses, Permanent TSB&rsquo;s credit policy does not permit lending for apartments/duplex houses in rural areas with a Loan To Value above 75%. This is due to a higher risk of the asset depreciating in value. However, there is no differentiation between Loan To Value requirements for rural and urban houses with the maximum Loan To Value being 90%.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The exceptions for the Christmas period are designed to support people to have a meaningful Christmas, albeit different to other years. The main objective is to stay safe and keep the COVID-19 numbers down so that we can maintain the lowest possible level of restrictions into the New Year. </p><p>In line with the <i>Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>the Government has, in recent months, framed restrictions to account for periods where there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally.  Throughout this period the Government has made special provision for weddings in view of the importance of these occasions to couples and the level of planning that is involved for couples and their families. </p><p>In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others. Such activity presents a higher risk of transmission of Covid-19. Accordingly the Government has decided that no live or loud music is permitted at weddings and this is reflected in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's current guidelines. </p><p>I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day and the impact on musicians and bands.

However in certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others. Such activity presents a higher risk of transmission of Covid-19. Accordingly, the Government has decided that no live or loud music is permitted at weddings and this is reflected in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's current guidelines.</p></reply>

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.</p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met upfront with a capital loan from the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) up to a maximum of &euro;60,000. This allows the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement with a local authority or an AHB for a period of time that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum lease period of 5 years. Up to end 2019, a total of 165 homes had been brought back into use under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A similar measure entitled the Buy and Renew Scheme supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the suitability of a property for social housing. Important considerations in this regard include the location of a property in relation to housing need and demand; the design, scale and suitability of a property for social housing use; and the costs and practicality of acquiring and remediating a property.</p>  <p>  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of the properties concerned. Up until end June 2020, local authorities delivered over 585 new social homes under the scheme.  Activity in this regard is largely delegated to local authorities so they can respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing.</p>  <p>  In respect of Social Housing, my Department can provide full funding to local authorities for sites on which they bring forward suitable new social housing construction projects, including sites acquired by compulsory purchase orders for instance. I am keen to see our local authorities expand their ownership of suitable sites for new social housing and with the record funding levels we have secured for new social housing delivery in 2021, we are in a position to support new projects including the associated site costs. It would be important for local authorities to engage with my Department directly and through the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office on this important issue.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.</p></reply>

Section 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that those Acts apply to every dwelling the subject of a tenancy, subject to certain exemptions which include situations where the landlord also resides in the building or part of the building concerned. </p><p>Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister or this Department to comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case.</p><p>Under section 100 of the Act, both parties to a dispute have a right to appeal to a RTB Tenancy Tribunal if either is unhappy with the outcome of a mediation or an adjudication in their case. Section 123(3) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 states that any of the parties concerned may appeal to the High Court, within the relevant time period, a determination of a Tribunal on a point of law. </p><p>The Planning and Development and Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest, resulting in great difficulty for households finding affordable accommodation. In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% per annum. The annual rent increase restriction applies to both new and existing tenancies, irrespective of a change of landlord.</p><p>Not all properties in RPZs are subject to the 4% restriction. </p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;</p><p>or</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning. A protected structure is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 Act provides a legal definition of &lsquo;substantial change in the nature of rental accommodation&rsquo; to illustrate the type of works to be carried out to a rental property to qualify for an exemption from the annual rent increase restriction applicable in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).</p><p>Such works shall result in:  </p><p>- a permanent extension increasing the floor  area by 25%; or</p><p>- an improvement in the Building Energy Rating (BER) by at least 7 ratings; or </p><p>at least 3 of the following:  </p><p>- a permanent alteration of the internal layout;  </p><p>- adaptations for a person with a disability; </p><p>- a permanent increase in the number of rooms;  </p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 3 or more ratings where the original BER was D1 or lower; or  </p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 2 or more ratings where the original BER was C3 or higher.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through general policy-setting and preparing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Roscommon County Council provides its fire services from fire stations at Roscommon town, Elphin, Boyle, Ballaghdereen and Strokestown. Significant areas of the county are also served from fire stations located in adjacent counties including Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballyhaunis, Carrick-on-Shannon and Lanesboro. It also runs both statutory and community fire safety services. </p>  <p>  My Department was informed by Roscommon County Council in February 2017 that, due to a particular local circumstance, Castlerea fire brigade was being stood down. It is my understanding that this situation arose because of internal staffing issues and it was judged by Roscommon County Council that it was unsafe to mobilise this fire brigade to emergency incidents.  I was assured that, during this period,  an efficient and appropriate fire cover for Castlerea fire station ground was provided from adjacent fire stations and that the elected members of Roscommon County Council were briefed on the on-going situation.</p>  <p>  Fire cover has continued to be provided from the adjacent fire stations and my Department has been  assured that fire cover in the area has been and continues to be managed and delivered in an efficient and safe manner by adjacent fire brigades. Roscommon Fire and Rescue Service is equipped to deal appropriately with the level of fire risk in the community and, while Castlerea Fire Brigade  was stood down three years ago, the fire service to residents, business owners, institutions and schools has continued to be delivered in a safe and appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, under the Local Government Act 2001, arrangements in relation to staffing in each local authority are the responsibility of the relevant Chief Executive of that Authority.  In this regard, as the employers, Roscommon County Council pursued grievance, disciplinary and mediation processes to try resolve the issues within Castlerea fire station over the last number of years. As these efforts have not been successful, I understand that a decision has now been made by Roscommon County Council not to re-open Castlerea Fire Station. This is an operational decision taken appropriately at local authority level.</p>  <p>  I remain re-assured that fire safety in the area has been and continues to be managed and delivered in an efficient and safe manner from adjacent fire brigades by Roscommon Fire Service.</p></reply>

The Greek authorities have thanked us for this offer of assistance and we understand from them that, while immediate needs have been met, the Ministry will continue to assess the situation in case of another renewal of interest for more items.</p>  <p>  My Department also recently made a contribution of &euro;225,000 to UNICEF, which will support the restoration of Education and Child Protection services for children and youth from the Moria Camp on Lesvos.  The destruction of Moria Camp on 9 September has led to the disruption of education and child protection services for 4,200 children.  Support for these migrant children, who are mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, complements the considerable Irish Aid humanitarian support to refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>  <p>  With regard to the families being relocated to Ireland, this is a matter for the Department of Justice and was the subject of an announcement by that Department on 1 October.</p></reply>

In 2020, some examples of campaigns included the Passport Online and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;, both these campaigns will be ongoing in 2021.</p>  <p>  Dependent on the situation in regard to international travel in 2021, the estimated budget for the Passport Online Campaign will be approximately &euro;400,000.  This is in line with previous such campaigns.  The objective being to have a continual presence and awareness of the Online Passport Service for Irish adults and children. If it goes ahead, the campaign will have a multi-faceted approach, through social media platforms, national and regional print and broadcast media and outdoor advertising.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on the &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; Public Information campaign was approximately &euro;710,000 in 2020.  While the costs of the 2020 campaign were borne by my Department, this is a whole of Government campaign prepared and executed in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, in particular, the Department of the Taoiseach. The public information campaign will continue pending the outcome of the EU &ndash; UK negotiations and subsequent political developments and decisions. Campaign details and projected expenditure in this area will be made available once those plans have been finalised.</p>  <p>  In addition to public awareness advertising my Department also participates in a number of public outreach opportunities. Such outreach events provide an effective means to engage with a broad cross-section of the public.  They are particularly important in providing essential information concerning the services and programmes operated by the Department and to keep the public informed of the many areas of work where the Department of Foreign Affairs is active on their behalf. </p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing pandemic, Public Outreach engagements currently foreseen for the first half of 2021 include providing a digital information stand and workshops at the BT Young Scientist Exhibition 2021, a digital celebration of Africa Day and online platforms to showcase Ireland and engage with our diaspora over the St. Patrick's Day period. The budget available for these events is still being finalised, but indicatively, the equivalent budget during 2020 was in the region of &euro;220,000.</p></reply>

Legal advice was sought and an independent reviewer was appointed. The Reviewer&rsquo;s independent report considered the Defence Forces health and safety regime, its current policy and its application. Although the report found that the Defence Forces regime appears to be capable of meeting statutory requirements, it makes a number of observations; including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure monitoring. It also notes that the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such allegations. The report of the independent reviewer was provided to the individuals who made the protected disclosures and it was also published on the Department of Defence website. </p>  <p>  In parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016 by the HSA, the Air Corps had continued to work with the HSA to improve its health and safety regime. The HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances. The HSA has now closed its investigation. However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.</p>  <p>  I am advised by my military authorities that the facility referred to by the Deputy is in fact an outdoor training area as distinct from an outdoor Gym. This equipment was installed at a cost of &euro;21,918 including the neccessary site works.  I am further advised that the Defence Forces do not plan to relocate the equipment elsewhere as they are not aware of any safety concerns pertaining to the current location.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis include:</p><p>- operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>- support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>- transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>- collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>- support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>- PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>- provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>- transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>- assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>- production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>- the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p>In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies  Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force.  Examples include: </p><p>- Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports.</p><p>- Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>- Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p><p>Since 13 March 2020, an average of 187 Defence Forces personnel have deployed on COVID-19 related supports on a daily basis.</p><p>The Defence Forces are also represented on the High Level Task Force for Covid-19 Vaccination.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, importantly, in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school. Curricular provision for Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and RSE across primary and post-primary level is aimed at ensuring that topics are covered in an age appropriate manner. The teaching of RSE is mandatory up to and including Senior Cycle (Leaving Cert).</p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships. RSE forms a key part of this. RSE has been a compulsory part of the primary and post-primary curriculum since the late 1990s. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The review originated from the June 2017 report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the 8th Amendment to the Constitution and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the 8th Amendment&rsquo;s report of December 2017.</p>  <p>  The NCCA is the body which has statutory responsibility to advise the Minister on the contents of curriculum. It conducted a thorough and transparent review, including consideration of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the 8th Amendment&rsquo;s report and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. This report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019. </p>  <p>  The NCCA were asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum, in particular the importance of consent and what it means. Other areas looked at included, but were not limited to: developments in relation to contraception; healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet; the role of school ethos: and, LGBTQ+ matters.</p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. These include primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and SPHE in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised. </p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work until recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. Both the primary and post primary development groups have met, first on the 20th of October and a further two times since. Further meetings are scheduled for 2021 at a similar pace.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of an online toolkit for SPHE/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources. </p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by my Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.</p></reply>

Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  School Transport services commenced on the 26th August for the 2020/21 school year.  All children who are eligible for school transport and who applied and paid by the deadline have been accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p>  <p>  The annual charge for school transport services is &euro;100 per annum for primary children and &euro;350 for post primary children with a maximum family charge of &euro;220 for primary children only or &euro;650 overall.  The service is heavily subsidised, with less than 8% of the cost of the scheme being recouped from fare-paying pupils in 2019.</p>  <p>  In view of the exceptional circumstances arising this year there will be a flexible approach adopted with regard to refunds on bus tickets.

Two of these conditions were subsequently the subject of a first party appeal by my Department to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (ABP). The decision on this appeal was received on 4 February 2020. </p>  <p>  In early December 2019, the tender notice was published for the first bundle of projects in the first stage of a two stage tender process to establish a new Framework of Design and Build Contractors. </p>  <p>  It was not possible for the school in question to be included in the first bundle of projects as the decision of ABP was not received until February 2020. </p>  <p>  This school building project is due to be included in the next bundle of projects and it is expected to go to tender in Quarter 2 of 2021. This exact timeframe will be dependent on the completion of phase 2 of the current tender process to establish the Framework of Contractors which is expected to conclude in Quarter 1 of 2021.</p>  <p>  Pending delivery of the permanent building project, my Department will continue to address the interim accommodation needs of the school on its permanent site and the school authorities will be kept informed of progress.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, the total spend on the provision of interim accommodation is some &euro;4.78m including some &euro;220,000 of expenditure related to Furniture/Equipment and ICT which will be used when the school moves to their permanent accommodation and some &euro;1.5m of expenditure related to site works for the interim accommodation which will also facilitate the construction of the permanent school building.</p></reply>

Enniscorthy is situated in the Enniscorthy school planning area. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  My Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within the particular area and its ability to meet increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and work on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years, including those which may arise in the Enniscorthy school planning area, is at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those in County Wexford, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action.  </p>  <p>  In addition to these ongoing exercises, my Department continues to liaise with Wexford County Council in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision in all areas of Wexford. My Department engages further on such matters with the Council through the review of the County Development Plan, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.</p></reply>

This is important to ensure certainty for the school community about the dates of school holidays.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that it is the view of Public Health that the evidence available to date shows that schools are proving to be safe spaces for children and for staff. Transmission rates of Covid-19 in schools are low, much lower than the rate currently in the community.

This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus &Eacute;ireann to be used solely for the purposes of the School Transport Scheme.  Any surplus was sealed in the school transport scheme and the uncommitted reserve was repaid fully to the Department in December 2018.</p></reply>

Schools have put significant measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and significant funding has been provided to support schools in this respect.  The evidence to date from a public health perspective is that schools are safe.  The approach to Covid-19 in schools is led by the advice and guidance of the HSE Public Health.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The advice outlines the view of public health that given current knowledge about COVID-19 disease in children, it is difficult to justify cocooning in most children with underlying conditions. Long-term cocooning of children with complex medical needs is likely to adversely affect them and may outweigh the potential risk of infection. </p>  <p>  The HPSC advice goes on to advise that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, draft proposals on a new public service pay agreement were agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors including my Department. These proposals will now be considered in detail by the various unions and their members. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. This builds on the series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through the various pay agreements.

That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.</p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20 and may occur in 2020/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. </p>  <p>  It is my firm intention to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   </p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.  It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and my Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. The group met for a second time on 14 December.</p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 981,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community.  The Free Travel Scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues.  The Free Travel Scheme was also never intended to provide additional transport options to travel pass holders but to allow them access to existing services available from transport providers who participate in the scheme. </p>  <p>  One of the key aspects of the free travel scheme is that the service provided is via open, publicly available services.  Wheelchair accessible taxis are private hire vehicles and any decision to allow free travel pass holders to use their free travel passes on a category of private hire vehicles would lead to similar requests from other groups that provide private hire vehicles.  It would lead to a fundamental change to the nature of the Free Travel Scheme and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide an estimate of the possible cost of extending the free travel scheme to allow persons with a disability to travel by taxi as the cost would be determined by such factors as the number of such journeys undertaken by each free travel pass holder, the length of each journey and also if the journey is undertaken with a companion/companions.  However, it would be expected that the increased cost to the free travel scheme would be very significant and would also have to include increased administrative costs to deal with the fundamental adjustment in the administration of any such complex scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department does provide an annual funding contribution of &euro;1.5 million from the Free Travel budget provision towards the Transport for Ireland Local Links Programme, which is administered by the National Transport Authority under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Programme provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.  The Programme aims to enhance and sustain nationwide accessibility through community based participation, particularly for those at risk of social exclusion.  Services provided include door to door services on certain routes.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme supports may be available to assist with necessary travel costs. The support can either be on a once-off basis as an exceptional needs payment or as a supplement where there is an ongoing need.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  At the end of 2019, 141 persons were in receipt of a Travel Supplement.  In addition, over 17,200 exceptional needs payments were made in 2019 to assist with travel costs, at a cost of almost &euro;1.2 million.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It will also be paid to people on equivalent jobseeker payments who have been in receipt of these payments for four months or more.  </p>  <p>  The reason Illness Benefit is not a qualifying payment for the Christmas Bonus is that, in the majority of cases, Illness Benefit is a short-term payment for those who are certified by their GP as having to take time out from their employment due to illness. </p>  <p>  People who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for Invalidity Pension, subject to satisfying the relevant medical and social insurance contribution criteria.  Those who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means-tested Disability Allowance, subject to the relevant medical criteria.  </p>  <p>  Recipients of both Invalidity Pension and Disability Allowance are eligible for the Christmas Bonus, and may also be eligible for other benefits including Fuel Allowance and the Household Benefits Package.  </p>  <p>  Any change to the current eligibility criteria for the Christmas Bonus payment would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The following public offices of my Department are located in Gaeltacht areas: Acaill, An Cloch&aacute;n Liath and Beal an Mhuirthead Intreo Centres and An Daingean branch office and all of these offices provide a telephone and face to face service through Irish. </p><p>Currently, there are 190 people serving in both Branch Offices and Departmental offices who are available to deliver services through Irish.</p><p>My department currently has a total of 6766 (6460.57 FTE) employees.</p><p>My Department is committed to providing quality services to its customers in either Irish or English as required by the customer and our commitments in this regard are set out in our Language Scheme.  Our staff are familiar with their obligations under the Official Language Act and Regulations.  In areas where the staff available are unable to deal with a person through Irish, a language interpretive service is offered to the customer.  This service, which can be arranged at very short notice, can be provided either by 3-way phone call, or in-person, as required.  All digital platform services and information within www.MyGovid.ie, www.MyWelfare.ie and www.WelfarePartners.ie is available to our customers in both Irish and English.  No digital service can go live without both languages being fully available and functional.</p><p>In addition, my Department is committed to the continued development and training of staff to facilitate the provision of services through Irish and continues to encourage and facilitate staff to avail of the range of supports and in particular to attend Irish training courses. </p><p>My Department continuously monitors the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 and the Department&rsquo;s Language Scheme and liaises with Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and provides reports and other information as required.  </p><p>I am satisfied that there are sufficient staff currently available to respond to requests for the delivery of the Department&rsquo;s services through Irish.</p></reply>

During this period, CE sponsoring authorities have been encouraged to continue to promote awareness of the benefits of CE in their local communities, ensuring that CE vacancies are well publicised.  They have also been able to advertise their vacancies free of charge on the Department's JobsIreland website www.jobsireland.ie.</p>  <p>  With the exception of CE participants that are taking up employment or those that have reached the State Pension age, CE participants who were due to finish over the period of the Level-5 restrictions have had their CE contracts extended until the 15th January, 2021.  Department officials have also continued to work with CE schemes to fill vacancies where it has been safe to do so.</p>  <p>  Recruitment to all of the Department&rsquo;s employment supports, including CE, will increase over the coming period in line with the planned recommencement of central activation services.</p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that CE has the best outcomes for participants.  At present, my Department has no plans to extend the eligibility criteria for CE and places on CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities.</p></reply>

The review of the DCA scheme completed in December 2012 also recommended a similar change to the age limits for the two schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the &ldquo;Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities&rdquo; (MWP) report, published in April 2017,  made two recommendations that addressed issues around the design of the main income supports schemes affecting young people with a disability.  These related to reconfiguration of the starting age of Disability Allowance (DA) from the current age of 16 to 18 years and implementing the principle of early engagement for young persons on DA and on all illness and disability payments.</p>  <p>  To fulfil a commitment made at the time of the report, a wide-ranging consultation exercise was conducted with persons with disabilities, their families and representative groups in relation to these recommendations.  This consultation began in September 2017 and continued until June 2018. </p>  <p>  It is imperative when deciding on any changes to the age limits for the relevant schemes that such changes have a positive effect on those in receipt of the payments and that we avoid any unintended negative consequences.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p><p>The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and for up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  Certification by a registered medical professional is required to support any claim for the special COVID-19 Illness payment.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  Only one contribution is required in the four weeks before the claim, thereby making the payment more accessible.</p><p>Where a medical practitioner advises a person to remain away from work because an underlying medical condition means they are unable to work safely, then the standard Illness Benefit payment may be made, subject to the conditions of the scheme being satisfied. </p><p>It should be noted that employers are asked to facilitate remote working where possible &ndash; in this situation people should remain on full pay from the employer. The Return to Work Safely Protocol provides that if an at-risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres.</p><p>From the outset of COVID-19, many employers will have taken the initiative, in line with subsequent requests from the Government, to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff time off where required. Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers and that care is often expressed in the form of negotiation, compromise and flexibility.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).</p>  <p>   A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021 to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid- 2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.  In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.</p></reply>

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  </p><p>The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. </p><p>By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.</p><p>Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.</p><p>The standard hours available are up to a maximum of 20 hours per week and children are eligible if at least one parent or guardian is not in work, education or training.</p><p>The enhanced hours available are up to a maximum of 45 hours per week where both of a child&rsquo;s parents or guardians are in work, education or training.</p><p>The NCS acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across families and offering subsidies at an hourly rate allows for flexible childcare arrangements to be made based on parental needs. </p><p>With regard to the specific questions raised:</p><p>- 517 school age children have received NCS standard hours award since September 2020.</p><p>- 11,698 school age children have received NCS enhanced hours since September 2020.</p><p>- 10,554 school age children were subject to a renewed CCSP application since September 2020</p><p>- 254 school age children were subject to a renewed TEC application since September 2020</p><p>- 21,754 school age children were registered with CCSP from September 2019 to 31 December 2019. </p><p>- 1,160 school age children were registered with TEC from September 2019 to 31 December 2019.</p><p>School age children for the purposes of this exercise are those aged 4 and over on CCSP. It is not readily possible to discern actual school going children from a CCSP application. The NCS specifically request school going information and has disaggregated children in the &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; ages of 4-5 where a child can be in either ECCE or school. As such the information in both schemes is not directly comparable.</p><p>It should be noted that the context for September 2019 and September 2020 are considerably different given the impact of Covid-19 and the measures in place to combat its spread. As such strong caution should be exercised in making comparisons in this regard also.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health has also stated that a short, time-limited examination will now be completed before the end of December in relation to the current allowances to 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students and the situation for 4th year students. He has said the review will be independently verified and will include engagement with representative organisations.</p><p>Following the initial assessment, there is now a specific exemption for student nurses and midwives, for which the Minister for Health secured Government approval, which entitles them to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) for the duration of their placements since they have not been able to work part time as they would have previously. These payments will be backdated to the start of their placements from September 2020.</p><p>I am not aware of any lack of desirability to undertake the educational processes necessary to graduate from nursing or midwifery degree courses, or wider healthcare courses.  </p><p>A large number of students apply for places in healthcare courses each year through the CAO. Health and welfare is the most popular category of courses, with 15,300 CAO applicants placing a Health and Welfare course as their first preference choice on the CAO. However only 5,800 of these were successful in gaining a place in a health and welfare course, as entry to these courses is highly competitive and there is consistently high demand.</p><p><b>Table 1: CAO First preferences and acceptances by subject area, 2019</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Subject Area</th>       <th>First   Preferences</th>       <th>Acceptances</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Welfare</td>       <td>15287</td>       <td>5815</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Business, administration and law</td>       <td>12450</td>       <td>7278</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arts and Humanities</td>       <td>11673</td>       <td>9006</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Engineering, manufacturing and construction</td>       <td>6678</td>       <td>3767</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics</td>       <td>5920</td>       <td>4362</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social sciences, journalism and information</td>       <td>5445</td>       <td>2835</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Education</td>       <td>5285</td>       <td>2452</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Information and Communication Technologies</td>       <td>3967</td>       <td>2390</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services</td>       <td>2360</td>       <td>1070</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary</td>       <td>1837</td>       <td>706</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>All Courses</td>       <td>70902</td>       <td>39681</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This is particularly true in the case of nursing and midwifery.

The Government has always sought to acknowledge and address the legitimate needs and expectations of victims&rsquo; families and survivors of Troubles-related attacks in this jurisdiction. </p><p>A substantive measure in this regard was the establishment of the Remembrance Commission in 2003, to administer a Scheme of acknowledgment, assistance and remembrance for victims of the Northern Ireland conflict, and their families, in this jurisdiction. The Commission continued in this work until 2008 and administered Acknowledgement payments, Economic Hardship payments, Displacement payments and Medical payments for victims&rsquo; families and those who were seriously injured in Troubles-related incidents in this jurisdiction. The Remembrance Commission also funded memorials such as the one in Belturbet.</p><p>On the conclusion of the Commission's term of appointment, special arrangements were put in place to ensure that victims resident in the jurisdiction who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the Troubles may have these costs reimbursed through the Victims of Crime Office of my Department. This scheme continues to this day.  </p><p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal makes awards to people who have suffered an injury sustained within the State on or after 1st October, 1972. The tribunal considers applications from people who suffer a personal injury or death as a result of a crime of violence. Ex gratia compensation may be awarded on the basis of any vouched out of pocket expenses, including loss of earnings experienced by the victim or, if the victim has died as a result of the incident, by the dependents of the victim. </p><p>The Reconciliation Fund, operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, was established in 1982 to support civil society organisations in creating a better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland, and also between Ireland and Britain.  One of the key thematic pillars under which funding is awarded is the <i>repairing of those issues which lead to division, conflict, and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society.</i>In that context, the Reconciliation Fund provides grant support to organisations working with victims and survivors of the Troubles, where it is considered that proposed projects have the potential to promote reconciliation in line with the particular eligibility criteria of the Fund.  </p><p>Irish Departments have also provided co-funding for projects under the PEACE III programme (2007-2013), and, currently, under the PEACE IV programme (2014-2020).  The North South PEACE IV Programme is co-funded by the EU and Government Departments in Ireland and Northern Ireland and it aims to support peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland.  Funding of &euro;17.6m under PEACE IV is provided for the Victims and Survivors Service project which aims to improve the health and well-being of victims and survivors and to support marginalised individuals and communities that that have suffered as a result of the Troubles.

Indeed, this matter was discussed among other issues at a recent meeting which I attended with the Taoiseach, Ministers of State James Browne and Hildegarde Naughton, and Deputy Paul McAuliffe.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may already be aware of an ongoing collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority. This collaboration has resulted in an awareness campaign being rolled out in the lead up to Christmas, with the campaign ads asking parents not to buy scramblers or quad-bikes as presents for their children and highlighting the dangers involved with these vehicles. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised my Department that Garda&iacute; respond to all reports of anti-social behaviour and conduct operations on an ongoing basis to target the anti-social activities of persons using scramblers, mopeds and quads in parks and greens, and have also highlighted the dangers associated with the use of these vehicles through various media and social media platforms. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles this behaviour from a number of fronts, with targeted enforcement in areas with high activity, working with petrol stations to prohibit the sale of fuel to persons who are using these vehicles, as well as community outreach. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to carrying out enforcement with increased visibility in areas which are most affected by the issue, and this will continue.  </p>  <p>  For example, in the Finglas area last year on Christmas morning, a major Garda operation was put in place, involving members attached to Regular Policing Units, District Detective Units, Specialist Units and Divisional and Regional Traffic. The outcome of this operation resulted in 11 motorbikes and two stolen cars being seized. Five people were arrested for offences relating to the Road Traffic Act, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Criminal Justice (Theft &amp;amp; Fraud Offences) Act. A similar operation is planned for Christmas morning 2020.</p></reply>

This work is being informed by an assessment of international best practice and having regard to our EU and CTA commitments.  I intend to consult with relevant Government Departments, civil society and other interested parties, before finalising the Scheme, which I expect to be in a position to launch in the second half of 2021.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their own and their family's status.  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. </p>  <p>  Insofar as persons residing in State provided accommodation are concerned, they are either in the international protection process, including appeals to initial decisions, or the leave to remain process.  A small number, having been unsuccessful in their application for international protection, have been issued with deportation orders.  If unsuccessful, I as Minister for Justice, have the discretion to grant permission to remain, where appropriate, or I can consider a case for permission to remain if made following the issue of a deportation order.  </p>  <p>  While I will keep the matter under review, persons who have applied for international protection are the subject of a thorough process laid out by the Oireachtas in statute to meet Ireland's international obligations.  Accordingly, it is not my intention, at this stage, to include them in a separate discretionary regularisation scheme.</p></reply>

As these records relate to the business of the court, they are within the control of the judge concerned. In accordance with the Constitution, the judiciary are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Court offices do not control the release of the recordings or transcripts.</p><p>Special procedures are in place for any party who wishes to apply for access to a recording of court proceedings (also known as the &ldquo;DAR&rdquo; recording). Rules of court govern the procedure to be followed when seeking access to any recording of court proceedings and the terms on which access may be allowed.  These rules are prescribed in the following statutory instruments:</p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>Any request for access to a recording of court proceedings must be made by formal application to the trial judge in the proceedings, and on notice to the other party or parties to the proceedings. </p><p>It is a matter for the judge to decide whether, and in what format, access to a recording of court proceedings is provided. The reasons for a judge's decision not to release records would be pronounced in open court and could be included in any order that is handed down. </p><p>The court may turn down an application for a recording or transcript where the person making the application is unconnected to the proceedings.  However, if they have legitimate grounds to access the information, it is issued to them.</p><p>If an application for court recordings has been granted by the judge, the applicant may have to pay the transcription costs (unless the judge directs otherwise). The payment of the fee for the transcript is typically only levied in civil matters and the cost of producing a transcript of a recording is approximately &euro;200 per hour of audio recording. Where a transcript is already prepared for a criminal trial judge, the party seeking the transcript would not be asked to pay a fee. </p><p>The Courts Service does not record the length of time between an application being lodged, the date of the court application and the release of a record of proceedings. However, in general, once a court grants such an application, the copy record is produced on a priority basis and sent to the person who has applied for it within a matter of days.</p></reply>

However, that was in the specific context of new licensing arrangements being introduced and represented an opportunity for people to regularise their situation before the heavier penalties provided for in the legislation came into force. </p><p>It was not expected that the 2006 Amnesty would result in hardened criminals handing up weapons and it would not be the expected outcome of the introduction of a weapons amnesty now.</p><p>Equally, I am not convinced it is desirable to allow people who hold firearms illegally to evade the legal consequences for that. </p><p>In regard to other weapons such as knives, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the consistent expert advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that such an amnesty is not likely to yield any significant benefits. Indeed, in many instances, ordinary household/kitchen knives are used in knife crimes and it has not been the experience that knives of this type are handed in during any amnesty. </p><p>I will however, continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The NPHET reviews international developments as a component of their overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the COVID-19 and are informed by the international scientific evidence, and guidance by international bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). WHO and ECDC guidance is formulated in the context of considered appraisal of the international experience and accumulating scientific evidence in relation to COVID-19. </p><p>The aim of face coverings is to reduce the spread of infection by acting as a source control to stop the spread of infection by the person wearing the covering (including those who do not know they are infected, such as those with no symptoms) or to protect the wearer from droplet splashes or inhaling airborne contaminants including small (aerosol) and large particle droplets. </p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the advice we are giving is that the use of face covering by persons going out in public has been recommended by an increasing number of countries. In Ireland, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible, in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation. Face coverings are also mandatory on public transport, including in taxis, as well as in bus and rail stations and in shops and other retail outlets. In restaurants, you should wear a face covering on your way to and from your table.</p><p>The wearing of face coverings is also recommended when visiting the homes of those who are over 70 years of age or who are medically vulnerable, by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are over 70 years of age who are medically vulnerable, and if you are travelling in a vehicle with someone you don't live with.  </p><p>The relevant regulations in relation to face coverings are outlined below and can be viewed at:- </p><p>- Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid19) (Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 512/2020)</p><p>- Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid19) (Face Coverings in certain premises and businesses) Regulations 2020 (S.I No. 511/2020)</p><p>- Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (Face Coverings in Small Public Service Vehicles and Certain Premises) Regulations 2020 S.I. (No. 569 of 2020)</p><p>- Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (Face Coverings in Certain Premises and Businesses) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 571 of 2020)</p><p>To inform national efforts in response to COVID-19, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is developing Health Technology Assessment evidence summaries to answer specific research questions posed by the NPHET. For your information, the HIQA evidence summaries on various topics, including on the use of face masks in the community is available at:-  An updated version of the HIQA evidence summary was presented to NPHET at its meeting on December 10<sup>th</sup>and will be published shortly. </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has also published a range of guidance documents, including guidance of the use of face coverings, which are available at the following link:- </p><p>The current advice regarding face coverings, including the circumstances in which it is mandatory to wear a face covering, is available at  and.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance.

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p><p>The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent&reg;):</p><p>- For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>- For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE received an application for pricing/reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p><p>Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing/reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p><p>The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.</p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.

This was done through a variety of measures, including the increase of the number of medical interns. 734 medical intern posts are traditionally available in Ireland each year. Due to the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, 992 medical intern places were made available for the 2020/2021 intake.</p><p>  Through the Winter Plan and National Service Plan for 2021, there is a comprehensive resourcing strategy to permanently expand the health service workforce by 15,838 whole-time equivalents. There is a variety of recruitment strategies and campaigns planned. Currently, it is not envisioned that additional medical interns will be required, but this option remains open to the Health Service Executive should they require it.</p><p>  Naturally I would encourage more medical graduates to stay in Ireland, and to continue their training here. The significant increase in intern numbers put in place in 2020 was a direct response to the COVID-19 crisis.  For July 2021, it is considered likely that there will be available a sufficient number of Basic Specialist Training (BST) posts to accommodate the additional doctors (subject to their suitability), who will be completing their internships in that month, and who will wish to apply directly to a BST programme. I hope that these doctors will stay and train in Ireland, and contribute to the forthcoming exciting opportunities in the Irish health system, as it develops in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).  They use a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  When there is a proposed decision by the HSE not to support reimbursement of a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline.  This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to reconsider their decision. The HSE must then consider those representations and make a formal decision.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, Ireland joined the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with the objective of working with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, additional funding of &euro;50m was provided for new medicines in Budget 2021.  This funding will allow the HSE Executive Management Team to approve new and innovative medicines which have been recommended by the HSE Drugs Group on the basis of efficacy and value for money in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

However, the restrictions, while very regrettable, are considered necessary to protect the safety of patients, the wellbeing of staff and the operability of our maternity services.  </p>  <p>  The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has assured the Department that midwifery and obstetrical front-line staff are acutely aware of the important support provided by partners at the time of birth and that they wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has issued guidance regarding attendance at hospitals during the pandemic, which includes attendance at maternity hospitals.  The guidance advises that restrictions on partner visiting; accompanying persons in labour; or parents visiting neonatal intensive care units, should be based on a documented risk assessment that is regularly reviewed.  I am advised that any such decisions are informed by this guidance and with due regard to local circumstances, including infrastructure, local rates of community infection and infection rates in members of staff.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the HSE has now re-classified partners as an &lsquo;essential companion&rsquo; for the purpose of fetal anomaly or anatomy scans.  The Department has been advised that the HSE has issued updated guidance to maternity hospitals, and the expectation is that commencing this week, partners&rsquo; attendance at fetal anomaly or anatomy scans will be facilitated, where possible, having regard to overall patient and staff safety.  </p>  <p>  However, it is important to emphasise that if a case of Covid-19 is linked to a maternity unit, Public Health teams will undertake a public health risk assessment, and it may be necessary to re-introduce restrictions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-16a.822.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600107#WRQ02300"><p>The Deputy refers to the motion put before the previous (32nd) Dail that seeks to ensure that the Government signs the optional protocol of the United Nation Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) and create a "commissioner for independent living" to ensure that rights given under the UNCRPD regarding Personal Assistants are delivered to people with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Regarding the signing of the optional protocol, the Department of Justice had recommended that the Government would not consider opting into the Optional Protocol until the first reporting cycle of the Convention has been completed.  That will provide a clearer picture of the obligations arising under the Convention and the Optional Protocol.  Ireland has recently submitted its first national report, and our appearance before the UN Committee is likely to take place in mid 2022.</p>  <p>  Regarding the provision of Personal assistance services for people with Disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the area of disability services is a priority area for this Government. To support people with a disability, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;100 million is being provided for new disability measures next year under Budget 2021. These measures will include an additional 80,000 personal assistant hours.  The 2020 national service plan details that the HSE is seeking to deliver 1.67m hours of Personal Assistant Hours to over 2,550 people.</p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities be allowed to live an independent life of their own choosing, the same as any other person, and this is consistent with the disability reform policy - &ldquo;transforming lives&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant (PA) services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.</p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, the HSE provides Personal Assistant Services that are person-centred, equitable and transparent to people with a physical and/or sensory disability. </p>  <p>  People with disabilities are now living longer and living with a range of complex needs. In line with national policy implemented under Transforming Lives, the focus in recent years has been to enable people with disabilities to live lives of their choosing. The provision of Personal Assistant hours is an essential component of this.</p>  <p>  The PA works on a one to one basis, in the home and the community, with a person with a physical or sensory disability. A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the service user in planning and agreeing the type and the times when support is provided to them. Supporting independent living must enhance the person&rsquo;s control over their own life. </p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in March 2018 as a process of progressive realisation of the rights that people with disabilities hold under the Convention. Significant progress has been made on key aspects of the CRPD, including enabling most children with disabilties to participate in mainstream education, providing supports for people with disabilities into employment, implementing a policy of decongregation and reforming the law on decision making capacity. </p>  <p>  Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that</p>  <p>  - disabled people should live where they wish and with whom they wish;</p>  <p>  - they should enjoy a range of community support services including personal assistance;</p>  <p>  - they should enjoy community life and its opportunities on an equal basis to non-disabled people; and</p>  <p>  - they should not be subject to isolation or segregation.</p>  <p>  The PA service provided by the HSE adheres to these principles. The Programme for Government, cognisant of these principles, agreed to deliver further increased Personal Assistance hours.</p>  <p>  In the normal course of service delivery, an individual's requirements are constantly reviewed to ensure services meet changing need.  An individual&rsquo;s Personal Assistant hours may be adjusted following a service review where demand can result in one individual&rsquo;s hours being reduced in order to address priority needs of other people with disabilities within that community. </p>  <p>  This much needed flexibility gives local Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) the freedom to target Personal Assistant hours to maximum effect within their area. </p>  <p>  Beyond the clear policy and operational arrangements, which I have outlined, and which facilitate the availability of appropriate and growing levels of Personal Assistant support, I have no plans for additional legislation governing the rights, entitlements and operations associated with this service at this time.</p></reply>

It is directed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and coordinated by the HSE. Samples are taken by healthcare professionals in healthcare settings, community test centres, workplaces or in the patient&rsquo;s home.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to conduct the type of testing the Deputy describes. It should be noted that testing for Covid-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that Covid-19 testing has recently been offered at a third level institution. This was done in response to an ongoing outbreak in the student population there. A Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) was undertaken, and it was recommended to provide an opportunity for students to self-refer for Covid-19 testing. The decision to provide a similar testing facility at any other third-level educational institutes would be based on the undertaking of an appropriate risk assessment. The risk assessment applied in educational settings may be dynamic and change as new information becomes available, and the testing strategy may evolve as information unfolds. </p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. </p>  <p>  The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Given the scale of the functions being transferred and the significant budget involved (c. &euro;2bn in 2020), there are multiple financial, HR, policy, legal and governance workstreams underway within my Department to sequence the range of tasks necessary to effectively complete the transfer of responsibility between both Departments. </p>  <p>  Both Departments are engaged in regular meetings to provide effective oversight and co-ordination of the various tasks involved in the transfer of policy and budgetary responsibility. While significant progress has already made in advancing the transfer, work to-date has emphasised the complexity and interconnected nature of the service and financial arrangements currently in place. In addition to progressing the above workstreams, the drafting and enactment of primary legislation will be central to underpin and complete the timely transfer of policy and financial responsibility to the new Department. Taking account of all of these factors it is now considered that the first half of 2021 represents the most feasible timeframe for completion of all components needed to achieve the transfer of disability services to the new Department.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.</p>  <p>   This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>   The functions and powers of the Chief Inspector are set out in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended).  The Statutory powers include the cancellation of registration under section 51 of the Act and the urgent action under section 59 of the Act to attach, vary or remove a condition of registration or cancellation of registration.  </p>  <p>   In the first instance, the primary responsibility for the provision of safe care and service to nursing home residents rests with individual nursing home operators.  If the Chief Inspector cancels a registration under section 51 and the cancellation takes effect, or if the Chief Inspector obtains an order to cancel a registration in accordance to section 59 and the cancellation takes effect then under section 64 of the Act the Chief Inspector notifies the HSE of the cancellation of the registration and of the date on which this takes effect.  The HSE must make alternative arrangements, as soon as practicable for residents where registration has been cancelled and closure orders have been secured by HIQA.  Pending these alternative arrangements, the HSE, either with the consent of the registered provider or by order of the District Court shall take the charge of the designated centre.  </p>  <p>  HIQA is the health and social care regulator and does not operate hospitals or social care services such as nursing homes. When the Chief Inspector pursues the cancellation of a service&rsquo;s registration, she applies through the District Court under section 59 and a notice of proposal to cancel &amp;amp; notice of decision to cancel registration are made under section 51.  I understand that HIQA would usually ensure that the HSE is aware of the proposed cancellation of a service, noting that the HSE may be required to take over operation of the designated centre.  Where the Chief Inspector decides to apply to cancel the registration of a nursing home, it is normal for my Department to be informed, for information purposes.</p>  <p>  HIQA has advised the Department that when the Chief Inspector intends to make a section 59 application, she always ensures that notice is given to the registered provider of her intention. Notification of this is given both verbally and in writing (in the form of an Affidavit). A service can appeal to a District Court or take a judicial review. HIQA and the HSE have no role in the appeal process. Section 59 is a decision by the District Court and under section 64 the District Judge will then require the HSE to assume responsibility for the residents. The court can mandate, if required, that the provider cooperates with its decision. The length of this process is highly dependent on the level of risk posed. HIQA has further advised that the decision of the Chief Inspector to pursue cancellation is independent of HIQA, as it falls under section 51. However, the cancellation of a nursing home is the decision only of the District Court, as it falls under section 59. </p>  <p>  As the RCSI Hospital Group took over the operational management of the home in question in April, outside of the process set out above, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to his specific queries raised.</p></reply>

Pending these alternative arrangements, the HSE, either with the consent of the registered provider or by order of the District Court shall take the charge of the designated centre.  </p>  <p>  HIQA is the health and social care regulator and does not operate hospitals or social care services such as nursing homes. When the Chief Inspector pursues the cancellation of a service&rsquo;s registration, she applies through the District Court under section 59 and a notice of proposal to cancel &amp;amp; notice of decision to cancel registration are made under section 51.  I understand that HIQA would usually ensure that the HSE is aware of the proposed cancellation of a service, noting that the HSE may be required to take over operation of the designated centre.  Where the Chief Inspector decides to apply to cancel the registration of a nursing home, it is normal for my Department to be informed, for information purposes.</p>  <p>   HIQA has advised the Department that when the Chief Inspector intends to make a section 59 application, she always ensures that notice is given to the registered provider of her intention. Notification of this is given both verbally and in writing (in the form of an Affidavit). A service can appeal to a District Court or take a judicial review. HIQA and the HSE have no role in the appeal process. Section 59 is a decision by the District Court and under section 64 the District Judge will then require the HSE to assume responsibility for the residents. The court can mandate, if required, that the provider cooperates with its decision. The length of this process is highly dependent on the level of risk posed. HIQA has further advised that the decision of the Chief Inspector to pursue cancellation is independent of HIQA, as it falls under section 51. However, the cancellation of a nursing home is the decision only of the District Court, as it falls under section 59. </p>  <p>   In the case of the nursing home in question, HIQA has advised that there was a COVID-19 outbreak which meant that the registered provider was unable to sustain the ongoing delivery of services. The Chief Inspector pursued the cancellation of registration, and the HSE assumed responsibility of the running of this nursing home.  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on the operational issues raised that come within its remit.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.</p>  <p>  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  The functions and powers of the Chief Inspector are set out in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended).  The Statutory powers include the cancellation of registration under section 51 of the Act and the urgent action under section 59 of the Act to attach, vary or remove a condition of registration or cancellation of registration.  </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the primary responsibility for the provision of safe care and service to nursing home residents rests with individual nursing home operators.  If the Chief Inspector cancels a registration under section 51 and the cancellation takes effect, or if the Chief Inspector obtains an order to cancel a registration in accordance to section 59 and the cancellation takes effect then under section 64 of the Act the Chief Inspector notifies the HSE of the cancellation of the registration and of the date on which this takes effect.  The HSE must make alternative arrangements, as soon as practicable for residents where registration has been cancelled and closure orders have been secured by HIQA.

Where the Chief Inspector decides to apply to cancel the registration of a nursing home, it is normal for my Department to be informed, for information purposes.</p>  <p>  HIQA has advised the Department that the Chief Inspector has applied to cancel the registration of two nursing homes since January 2020, one located in Wicklow, the second in Kerry. In both cases, there was a serious risk to the health or welfare of persons resident in the nursing home because of an act, failure to act or negligence on the part of the provider. Applications for cancellation were made to the District Court under section 59 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended) . The District Court granted the cancellation of registration under section 59 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended)  and the Chief Inspector notified the HSE to assume responsibility of the nursing home under section 64 of the act.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to any nursing homes it took operational responsibility for outside of this process.</p></reply>

For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p>  <p>  In addition to core HSE activity, the NTPF have advised my department that they have also approved 2 outpatient insourcing initiatives for funding for orthopaedics at Cavan General Hospital, so far in 2020, which will facilitate treatment for 290 patients on Orthopaedics waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided an additional &euro;240 million for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210m of which will be allocated as required to the HSE and &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the provision of treatment in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds from the baseline at the start of 2020. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p></reply>

Government will only use a vaccine if it meets the required standards of safety and effectiveness. All of the recommended vaccines used in Ireland are licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. They are licensed for use only when they have been shown to be both safe and effective.</p><p>  Due to the urgency posed by the pandemic, unprecedented efforts are ongoing to develop COVID-19 vaccines and make them available as soon as possible. Unprecedented levels of scientific research and collaboration, investment and early and proactive engagement between vaccine developers and regulators has helped speed up development and ensured that quality, safety and effectiveness are not compromised.</p><p>  Vaccines are a proven, cost-effective intervention to protect public health; second only to the provision of clean water. Worldwide, they save at least 2-3 million lives each year &ndash; and many more from crippling and lifelong illnesses.</p><p>  Certain priority groups will be vaccinated first. For example, frontline healthcare workers and people who are most at risk from serious infection if they catch COVID-19. Once these priority groups have been vaccinated, the vaccine will be available to the rest of the population.</p><p>  While a vaccine is to be welcomed, no vaccine is a silver bullet. It is the pharmaceutical intervention to complement our ongoing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions &ndash; the public health advice telling us to wash our hands, cough into our elbows, maintain 2 metres social distance and wear face coverings.</p><p>Yesterday, I published the National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy , which outlines Ireland&rsquo;s high-level plan for safe, effective and efficient vaccination of the population, while safeguarding continued provision of health and social care services.</p><p>The National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, which was prepared by the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination, was signed off by Cabinet yesterday. </p><p>An integrated work programme, comprising of seven workstreams was established by the Task Force, one of these workstream focused on Communications and Engagement. </p><p>The communications and engagement strategy the Department of Health is undertaking has two main objectives. The first is preparing for the vaccine, emphasising the safety and regulatory processes that are taking place in Ireland, Europe and across the world, engaging with people who have genuine hesitancies around the vaccine and communicating the Government Plan from acquisition to prioritisation to distribution. </p><p>  The second objective will focus on the implementation  of the vaccine programme &ndash; encouraging the public to get the vaccine, informing who will administer it and where, identifying people of trust to act as ambassadors for the vaccine. </p><p>  The communications strategy will build on the public trust the ongoing COVID-19 communications campaign has generated through open and transparent communication led by experts, ongoing understanding of public sentiment, clear and consistent communication to empower the public and collaboration between my Department, the HSE and the HPRA.</p><p>  Key learning from the recent HPV campaign shows the importance of listening to the public, acknowledging and addressing their fears, delivering clinical advice with empathy and ensuring that the vaccine is logistically and financially easy to access. </p><p>  Understanding, reacting and responding to public sentiment had been a core element of the COVID-19 and HPV campaign to date through a weekly quantitative Tracker for my Department, prepared by Amar&aacute;ch, a fortnightly qualitative tracker utilising focus groups and in depth interviews and the work of the Behavioural Research Advisory Group.</p><p>  Active expert participants in the campaign will come from my Department,  the HPRA, and the HSE, ensuring clear and consistent communications from a trusted source, while the messaging will move from the yellow &lsquo;alert of the COVID-19 campaign, to a blue for hope and control.</p></reply>

However, the restrictions, while very regrettable, are considered necessary to protect the safety of patients, the wellbeing of staff and the operability of our maternity services.  </p>  <p>  The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has assured the Department that midwifery and obstetrical front-line staff are acutely aware of the important support provided by partners at the time of birth and that they wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has issued guidance regarding attendance at hospitals during the pandemic, which includes attendance at maternity hospitals.  The guidance advises that restrictions on partner visiting; accompanying persons in labour; or parents visiting neonatal intensive care units, should be based on a documented risk assessment that is regularly reviewed.  I am advised that any such decisions are informed by this guidance and with due regard to local circumstances, including infrastructure, local rates of community infection and infection rates in members of staff.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the HSE has now re-classified partners as an &lsquo;essential companion&rsquo; for the purpose of fetal anomaly or anatomy scans.  The Department has been advised that the HSE has issued updated guidance to maternity hospitals, and the expectation is that commencing this week, partners&rsquo; attendance at fetal anomaly or anatomy scans will be facilitated, where possible, having regard to overall patient and staff safety.  </p>  <p>  However, it is important to emphasise that if a case of Covid-19 is linked to a maternity unit, Public Health teams will undertake a public health risk assessment, and it may be necessary to re-introduce restrictions. </p>  <p>  Any requests for meetings should be forwarded, in the normal way, to my Diary Secretary.</p></reply>

The personal representative is known as the executor where there is a will or the administrator where there is no will or no executor appointed. On production of probate or letters of administration, a death gratuity is payable to the legal personal representative. This is a requirement of the pension scheme.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, while probate is being processed, should the individual concerned require funds for funeral expenses, the HSE has discretion to released monies from the deceased person's gratuity entitlement. Any amount released would be deducted from the final gratuity payable.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned requires this facility, he/she may make enquiries with the HSE for the release of funds.

A re-inspection of the parcel  took place on 23<sup>rd</sup>August 2019.  The inspection process determined that there was no agricultural activity or evidence of livestock activity on the parcel on any of the dates visited and the maximum eligible area of the parcel was thus reduced to zero.

These Regional Forums, along with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF), are consultative bodies, established in 2014, to foster industry-led development of proposals for the management of non-quota stocks within six nautical miles of the Irish shore. </p><p>Last year, the NIFF finalised the <i>Strategy for the Irish Inshore Fisheries Sector 2019-2023</i>, the first industry-led blueprint for how the sector could develop in coming years. Each of the RIFFs, including the South West, fed into this process. BIM is leading implementation of the strategy in partnership with the NIFF. An implementation group, which includes State and industry representatives, has identified priority actions under the strategy and is monitoring and driving implementation progress. The strategy is available online at the Inshore Fisheries Forum website, .</p><p>Last week, I was pleased to have my first meeting with the NIFF, along with representatives from the Marine Institute, the SFPA and BIM.  Industry representatives outlined the challenges facing the inshore sector this year.  The Programme for Government strongly commits to supporting the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving its potential and I look forward to working with the NIFF on how we can do this together.</p></reply>

The current Forestry Programme has State Aid approval under the EU's State Aid Guidelines for the agriculture and forestry sectors (2014/C 204/01). These guidelines are currently under review and the revised version will largely depend on the final shape of the CAP post-2020 proposals and the CAP Strategic Plans in particular. </p>  <p>  As part of the process to ensure that existing State aid schemes, including the Forestry Programme, that expire on 31/12/2020 can continue beyond this period, the Commission offered Member States the opportunity to extend existing schemes by 15 October 2020.  My Department submitted its block notification to the Commission within the appropriate timeframe and included the measures under our Forestry Programme. We are waiting on a final decision on this application.</p>  <p>  This extension is needed as otherwise we would have to cease all schemes under the National Forestry Programme at the end of this year. These schemes, including those which involve planting trees for example, are a key part of our national climate mitigation measures.  This would be unfair to all stakeholders and farmers who are applying or who intend to apply for these schemes under the Programme. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing contact with the European Commission on this request and I will be updating as soon as I have a final decision on the request.</p></reply>

This funding will allow for the creation of co-working and hub infrastructure in many rural towns and villages across Ireland, as well as direct capital for the purchase of ICT equipment which is necessary for the day to day operation of these facilities.</p>  <p>  Libraries In 2018 there was a &euro;7.8 million investment to support the upgrade of ICT capacity and facilities in public libraries and a number of approved projects were for the installation and expansion of digital connectivity in libraries.

Such funding includes:</p><p><b>The &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund.</b>This was introduced in April 2020 to provide funding to community groups participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which was led by the Local Authorities.  Community halls and centres that were involved in the &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; were eligible to apply for this funding. </p><p><b>My Department's Community Services Programme (CSP)</b>supports over 420 community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model, including facilities such as community halls and centres under Strand 1 and 1s. </p><p>CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of supporting an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and a manager, where warranted.  As a result of COVID-19 my Department developed a &euro;4.75m Support Fund to assist CSP supported organisations most in need, to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period and until April 2021. </p><p>To date, 357 of the CSP supported services have been approved funding of some &euro;3.6m under the CSP Support Fund, as outlined in the table below.  A further 30 organisations are currently under consideration, a final decision will be made in the coming week.  Of those supported under the CSP Support Fund, 224 organisations are supported under Strand 1 and 1s &ndash; community halls and facilities.</p><p><b>The Community and Voluntary Sector Covid-19 Stability Fund</b>was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. The criteria of the scheme stated that any grants awarded would be dependent on the need identified and organisations approved for funding were prioritised on that basis.</p><p>While not specifically aimed at Community Centres, some such organisations were eligible where they were providing critical frontline services to the most vulnerable in their communities. </p><p><b>The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP)</b>has provided a total of &euro;7m for capital grants towards enhancing facilities available to communities. The funding was allocated to each local authority area and administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs).  Community halls and centres were eligible to apply for this funding. </p><p><b>My Department also recently launched a &euro;1.7m COVID-19 Emergency Fund</b>, which groups, including those involved with community halls and centres, can now apply for through their Local Community Development Committee (LCDC).</p><p>Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal Scheme - Accelerated Measure in response to COVID-19,  </p><p><b>The Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus Package allocated an extra &euro;10m of funding to support towns and villages to adapt to COVID-19 under the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</b>This funding was in addition to &euro;15m already ear-marked for the scheme for 2020. The scheme is placing a particular focus this year on immediate responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (Accelerated Measure) and medium-term interventions to assist rural towns and villages to recover from the impact of the virus (Standard Measure). The projects approved will assist businesses/communities in towns and villages to adapt to the specific challenges posed by COVID-19 (e.g. social distancing) and to increase footfall and generate economic activity in the short-term. </p><p>We were unable to collate the details by county in sufficient time for this PQ response however we will forward a list to the Deputy once complete.</p></reply>
