Taking account of the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, and up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness, the HAP scheme is operating effectively. </p>  <p>  HAP is an immediately available support for those who qualify for social housing.  To date in 2019, an average of 333 additional tenancies have been supported through the scheme each week, with over 50,000 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Increasing the current HAP rent limits could have inflationary effects, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. </p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

There is already some mobility provided for in the larger urban areas and for HAP recipients. </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the possibility of extending that mobility by expanding the numbers of areas that social housing applicants can apply for.  The basic premise is that households in receipt of, or qualified for, social housing support in one local authority area could potentially transfer to, or be allocated, social housing in another local authority area. </p>  <p>  The four Dublin local authorities already co-operate in arrangements that enable social housing applicants to apply for housing in one or two of the other Dublin authorities simultaneously.  Similar arrangements apply in the two Cork and two Galway local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In addition, persons on social housing waiting lists who elect to take the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) can source accommodation through HAP in any local authority area if their income is below the social housing income limit for the area concerned.  As of June 2019, 4,455 HAP recipients had sourced their accommodation in a different  local authority area to the authority of application and 483 of those were on the Dublin waiting lists but sourced accommodation outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the principle of increasing mobility for social housing applicants and I intend to bring proposals in this regard forward in due course.</p></reply>

The appropriate way to take these factors into account is ultimately through a competitive procurement process rather than through price regulation.</p>  <p>  A transparent and exhaustive process has been undertaken over many years by Dublin City Council to allow it to identify the most effective delivery model for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, to ensure that this key site is developed in a tenure sustainable and financially viable way.  This has included a detailed procurement process which has now reached the point where a preferred bidder has been selected and through which the City Council will be able to ensure that a high quality redevelopment of the site, with significant local community facilities, will be delivered.</p>  <p>  In addition to the 56 social housing homes already under construction on the site, almost 770 further homes are to be provided, including nearly 200 further social housing homes as well as 165 homes at more affordable process, catering for those families who may not be eligible for social housing but may still need support in meeting their housing needs.  The indications are that the homes to be made available under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will have a discount on the open market prices of 30-40%.  The referenced figure of &euro;420,000 is understood to relate to just 4 of the 165 discounted homes planned to be made available and I understand that Dublin City Council is re-examining how the price of those homes might be reduced below &euro;400,000.  The indicative prices for all the other affordable homes are considerably less than the referenced figure and, in most cases, significantly so; in fact, the majority of the homes have indicative prices below &euro;310,000.  A couple who are each on average earnings  - approx. &euro;40,000 - would be in a position to afford most of the indicative prices quoted for the O'Devaney Gardens development.</p>  <p>  The significant discounts which will be provided on the affordable purchase homes will mean that homes will be available to very many individuals and families on more moderate incomes who would otherwise not be in a position to own their home in the area concerned.</p></reply>

Each SDZ is governed by a Planning Scheme, that must prepared as part of a process that enables local residents and communities, as well as their local elected representatives at Council level, to input and shape how the SDZ is developed.</p>  <p>  In this way, SDZs are designed to ensure both the delivery of specified development and infrastructure, and consistency and certainty in the future development of an area, for all stakeholders, whether developers or local residents.</p>  <p>  The SDZ Planning Scheme adoption and amendment processes include a period of public consultation, before the local elected members of the relevant planning authority decide on the draft Scheme.  The outcome of the draft Planning Scheme process may be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, by any interested party who made a submission on the draft scheme.</p>  <p>  If an appeal is lodged to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Board may decide to hold an oral hearing, at which local residents and community representatives, as well as local councillors, have an opportunity to contribute further to the process.</p>  <p>  An adopted SDZ planning scheme provides certainty and consistency for all stakeholders, including residents and established communities, in relation to development within the designated area.  This is because planning applications for development within an SDZ may be approved only on the basis of compliance with the approved Planning Scheme. </p>  <p>  In recent years, since the introduction of the  Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process for large scale residential development directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there is the potential for some planning applications within an SDZ area to be made under the SHD process.  This is a matter that is currently under review as part of an overall review of the SHD process in respect of which I will be reporting to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In light of experience to date, I am satisfied that residents are given ample opportunity to express their views on proposed developments through the SDZ Planning Scheme process.</p></reply>

Due to the quasi-judicial and independent role of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in specific disputes.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants under the Residential Tenancies Acts. Section 34 of the 2004 Act provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the allowable grounds for terminations. Through an amendment introduced in 2016, where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances. In addition, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she intends to sell the property, he/she must enter into a contract for sale within 9 months of the termination date and, if not, must offer to re-let to a former tenant who provides their contact details. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Act also provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish/renovate the property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant who provides their contact details, upon completion of the works. Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment/renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such  a risk would be likely to exist for at least 3 weeks. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Act provides additional powers for  the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions. My Department will continue to keep the effectiveness and enforcement of the security of tenure provisions in the Acts under review.</p></reply>

On 26 November 2018, I announced initial support of &euro;100m in provisional allocations to a total of 88 projects, including &euro;6m of initial support for the Waterford North Quays Project.  The letter confirming this initial support also outlined my agreement in principle to further URDF support for this project.  </p><p>Under the first URDF call for proposals, the Council's bid included four very significant elements:</p><p>- Relocation of the City&rsquo;s railway station;</p><p>- A new pedestrian/cyclist/public transport bridge and associated urban greenway;</p><p>- Site access roads and road realignment;</p><p>- Off-site roads in the wider north bank of the Suir area in Waterford/Kilkenny.</p><p>It is intended that the infrastructural works involved will open up the site, making it more accessible and supporting the achievement of the objectives of the SDZ planning scheme more generally.</p><p>While I have agreed in principle to provide further URDF support for the overall project, its complexity means that its proposed composition, costs and sequencing must be refined and further examined so that the precise level of URDF support can be established, and apportioned to the various individual project components.</p><p>While the advancement of this project is, in the first instance, a matter for Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council, my Department is engaging actively on an ongoing basis with the Council  with a view to early resolution of these matters.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-18a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091800069#WRB02400"><p>Choice Based Letting is a method whereby available social housing stock is let by being openly advertised by local authorities to persons on the social housing waiting list. This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. </p>  <p>  Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities.  </p>  <p>  The Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 required all local authorities, if they had not already done so, to provide for Choice Based Letting as a method of allocation for social housing in their allocation schemes. The way in which Choice Based Letting is implemented, including decisions on which properties are to be offered through it, is a matter for the individual authority concerned. However, it must be done in accordance with the relevant regulations and their own scheme of priority. </p>  <p>  Given the clear benefits offered by Choice Based Letting, my Department will continue to liaise with the local authorities to ensure that it is implemented as widely as possible across the country.  This will be progressed as part of the implementation of a wider package of social housing reforms in respect of which proposals will be brought to Government shortly.</p></reply>

The Taskforce is working to improve and accelerate housing delivery in both local authority areas.  Its establishment mirrors a Taskforce established in Cork a number of years ago, which has provided a hugely successful framework through which new build social housing delivery across the 2 Cork local authority areas has increased more than tenfold in the 2 years to 2018.</p>  <p>  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered nationally through build, acquisitions and leasing in the period to 2021, the Galway Councils have a combined target of just over 2,000. While good progress has been made to date nationally, I want to see this replicated uniformly across the country, particularly in key locations such as Galway.</p>  <p>  The Chair of the Taskforce recently wrote to me and updated me on the work of the Taskforce. She confirmed that both local authorities were intensively involved in the Taskforce&rsquo;s work and that it is providing them with an important opportunity for direct, roundtable dialogue with my Department, the Housing Agency and the Approved Housing Body sector, so that each Galway authority can be supported in building the momentum essential for expanded delivery. The Chair also advised that achieving the necessary levels of delivery will take focus, time and continuing prioritisation, but all participants in the Taskforce are committed to the Government&rsquo;s housing targets. </p>  <p>  In relation to the minutes of the Taskforce, the secretariat for the Taskforce is provided by Galway City Council and I have asked my Department to liaise with the Council in relation to the publication of those minutes.</p></reply>

In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.  </p>  <p>  Within Rebuilding Ireland, supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness is identified as a key priority for the Government.  Increasing the level of overall housing supply, particularly in terms of social and affordable housing, and ensuring stability in the rental sector are essential to addressing fully the challenging situation in relation to homelessness, and very substantial progress continues to be made in those areas.  In parallel, additional and improved emergency accommodation is being provided, including through additional supported emergency beds and family hubs, in order to ensure that the needs of those experiencing homelessness can be responded to in as comprehensive a manner as possible. To date, 28 family hubs have been developed in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Limerick, Louth and Meath. </p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, is delivering permanent housing solutions for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation. The Plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 663 tenancies to be delivered by 2021. All regions now either have a contract in place or are at an advanced stage of the tendering process and tenancies are now in place in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. </p>  <p>  Preventing homelessness continues to be a priority, and in this regard, the Government has introduced new legislation to strengthen the protections for tenants, including significantly extended tenancy termination notice periods.  In addition, there are now Rent Pressure Zones in 42 areas nationally, in which rent increases are limited to 4 % p.a., and the operation of which has been strengthened further under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019. </p>  <p>  The Government has also increased the funding available to local authorities to deliver homeless services.  Budget 2019 provided an allocation of &euro;146m, an increase of over 25% on the 2018 allocation.  Funding for 2020 will be determined as part of the estimates process.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, the comprehensive programme of actions under Rebuilding Ireland supported 5,135 adults in exiting from homelessness, an increase of 8.6% on 2017.  For the first 6 months of this year, 2,285 adults exited homelessness, a 21% increase on the comparable period last year.  My Department will continue to work closely with the local authorities to ensure that comprehensive housing supports for all families and individuals experiencing homelessness are delivered as speedily as possible.</p></reply>

Authorities use the funding in the provision, for example, of parks, libraries, leisure amenities, fire and emergency services and improvements to the public realm, all of which benefit citizens directly and improve the fabric of our communities and quality of life. </p>  <p>  LPT allocations are based on estimated liability data from the Revenue Commissioners, with all of a local authority&rsquo;s annual allocation used to provide services locally. Local authorities have the power to vary the rates of LPT, up or down, by up to 15%. Where an authority varies the rate upward, it retains the additional income and, likewise, where the rate is reduced, the income is foregone.</p>  <p>  Every local authority retains 80% of the estimated LPT liability in their area, notwithstanding local variation decisions.  All local authorities contribute the remaining 20% to assist national equalisation funding.  Some 80% of the total LPT allocation in 2019 is being used at each local authority&rsquo;s own discretion. In addition, some 20% of LPT is directly supporting the provision of vital Housing and Roads infrastructure and services.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current overall funding model enables local authorities to support an appropriate level of service provision across the State.  However, the position will be kept under review in light of the outcome, in due course, of the LPT review being led by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as my own Department's LPT Baselines review.</p></reply>

Decisions regarding individual developments and tenure mix for new housing on local authority land is, in the first instance, a matter for each local authority, including its elected members.  </p>  <p>  The sites referred to are two of three significant residential sites being brought forward by Dublin City Council under its Housing Land Initiative (HLI). The HLI's aim is to ensure the delivery of mixed-tenure homes within the City Council area. All sites under the HLI are identified as Strategic Development and Regeneration Areas (SDRA) within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022.</p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective in Rebuilding Ireland and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities, where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation, based on income levels. They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas. </p>  <p>  With regard to the  O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens site, an exhaustive process has been undertaken over many years to allow the Council identify the current delivery model as the most effective to develop the site in a tenure sustainable and financially viable way.  The intention is to provide 768 badly needed new homes (an additional 56 social housing homes are being built on the site separately), comprising a tenure mix of 411 private homes, 192 social homes and 165 homes offered for purchase at a discount from market rates of between 30%-40% under the affordable dwelling arrangements. I am informed that while 50% of the built homes will be sold by the developer at market prices, these will account for just 22% of the land.</p>  <p>  In relation to the St Michael&rsquo;s Estate site, this has been selected as a Cost Rental &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; development. A core objective of Cost Rental is to offer more moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that cost rental would have a stabilising effect on the broader private rented market.  The current tenure mix proposed by Dublin City Council is 30% social housing and 70% cost rental.  While the proposal for the site development has not been brought to a conclusion, it is envisaged that structures will be put in place to ensure the tenure would remain Cost Rental over the longer term.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

It is the local authorities' own responsibility to select properties for inclusion in the programme and to determine the level of works; accordingly, pending their decisions on 2019 activity, my Department does not have detailed information at this stage on the number of homes that will be retrofitted in all 31 Council areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme is being implemented in two phases: Phase 1 is classed as a shallow retrofit and aims to ensure that the entire social housing stock has, as a minimum, cavity wall and attic insulation. Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrade works to those dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades; this is deemed to be a more deep retrofit.  In transitioning to the deep retrofit implementation, my Department has requested local authorities to achieve a 'B2' or equivalent building energy rating for their housing stock. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme, energy efficiency improvements have also been incorporated into the approximately 11,000 vacant social housing homes that have been returned to productive use under the Voids Programme since 2014. </p>  <p>  Policy and programmes in relation to supports for insulation of privately owned homes falls within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act and include, for example, a dwelling within which the landlord also resides. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under a tenancy, arrangement or agreement to which the Act does not apply, such as instances where a bona fide licensing arrangement exists, the RTB does not have any function in relation to such agreements or arrangements. </p>  <p>  If a dispute arises as to whether a purported licence in a co-living dwelling is in fact a tenancy, the RTB  can determine the matter and if it is a tenancy, the Residential Tenancies Acts apply.  Where the owner of a dwelling enters into an agreement with a person for the occupation of that dwelling, it is a private contractual matter between the parties as to whether that agreement is a licence or a tenancy. </p>  <p>  Given the relatively new nature of this form of accommodation, my Department will monitor the emerging shared accommodation sector and is keeping all aspects under review.</p></reply>

The fund is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable discounted homes can be delivered.  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per home and, on this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be provided. </p><p>The affordable dwelling purchase arrangements under which homes will be made available will be based on the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which were commenced in June 2018.<b></b>Further regulations will be put in place over the coming months and when the operational procedures for the programme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department.  </p><p>Two calls have been made under the Serviced Sites Fund to date, and approval in principle has been granted for funding of approximately &euro;127 million, to support almost 3,200 homes.

It is estimated that this site can accommodate approximately 470 homes in a high quality mixed-tenure development, including approximately 330 Cost Rental homes.</p>  <p>  Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.</p>  <p>  The rents for Cost Rental units will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants - these include low/zero land costs, a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind, and subvention through the Serviced Site Fund, where &euro;310 million is being made available to local authorities over three years, 2019 to 2021, to support the delivery of infrastructure for affordable housing.</p>  <p>  More competitive rental levels under the model can also be supported by accessing low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over an extended period of time. This long-term financing has, for example, been accessed via the European Investment Bank (EIB) who have indicated a strong interest in the St. Michael&rsquo;s project. My Department&rsquo;s engagement with the EIB has facilitated a research project into the development of the broader Cost Rental sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Plans regarding the development of the St. Michael's site are, in the first instance, a matter for Dublin City Council and my Department is engaging with the Council to support the process. Potential financing options for the project are under consideration, and long loan maturities may form part of the financial model. A working group is meanwhile working to develop a sustainable national approach to Cost Rental, so that the lessons from pathfinder projects like St Michael&rsquo;s can be applied to future larger-scale projects.</p></reply>

By year-end, 4,811 had been delivered, representing 97% delivery against target. This included 4,251 new build homes, and 560 vacant local authority dwellings brought back into use following substantial remediation.</p>  <p>  Focusing on one specific build delivery stream in isolation is failing to see that new build homes are delivered for households on social housing waiting lists through a range of build programmes and schemes. When setting targets for build activity, it is recognised that there will be a blend of delivery required to achieve the maximum, sustainable output and deliver the highest volume of homes with the available capital and current budgets.</p>  <p>  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are a vital component of all build activity for social housing. The properties provided through AHBs under these mechanisms are allocated to households on waiting lists in the same manner as local authority properties. In addition, through Part V delivery, even more homes are available to local authorities for tenants.</p>  <p>  Accelerating local authority build on local authority land is of course a very important focus of all stakeholders, and this Government wants to continue to drive further increased delivery in that regard. Progress to date has been very strong, with an almost doubling of local authority new build output between 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage very intensively with all local authorities to keep momentum on new build output as high as possible. By nature of the construction cycle, a substantial volume of output is weighted towards year end, as seen in previous years.</p>  <p>  When we examine the pipeline for new development, there are reasons to be optimistic in terms of meeting our ambitious delivery plans for 2019 and beyond. The Construction Status Report covering the period to June 2019 shows that there are now over 22,000 homes in the build pipeline, up more than 8% on quarter 1 of this year. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the number of homes on site at the end of June 2019 was 6,439. Given the healthy pipeline and expected delivery profile over the coming two quarters, I am confident that we are on track to meet our targets.</p></reply>

The plan focuses on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes in the period to 2021, while also making the best use of existing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant housing sector.</p>  <p>  Supporting families experiencing homelessness is an absolute priority for the Government and for my Department in particular.  In 2019, the Government increased the budget available to local authorities to deliver homeless services by over 25% to &euro;146m. This funding supports the delivery of services to prevent families having to enter emergency accommodation and to ensure that those families in emergency accommodation are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy within the shortest possible timeframe.  In 2018, the HAP Placefinder service was made available to all local authorities to support households experiencing homelessness to identify and secure a tenancy in the private rented sector.  My Department has approved funding for 23 Placefinder officers nationally.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also supporting local authorities to develop family hubs, through the provision of capital and operational funding. Family hubs provide a more secure and stable placement for families than is possible in hotels and B&amp;B's. Under the service level agreements in place with the operators of the family hubs, targets are in place for the operators to secure a tenancy for each family within a six-month period.  In some cases, it is not possible to achieve a tenancy within this period, including because of the housing requirements or preferences of an individual family.  While I have no immediate plans to introduce a limit on the time that families spend in homeless services, I and my Department will continue working with local authorities to ensure that housing solutions are delivered within the shortest possible timeframe for all households in emergency accommodation.</p></reply>

Commercial Rates, at c&euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly one third of local government current income. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was enacted earlier this year, in order to modernise and improve the rates system for ratepayers, local authorities and local communities.  </p>  <p>  The rates paid by individual rate-payers is a factor of the valuation carried out by the independent Commissioner for Valuation and the Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV), decided by local authority members. The Government has consistently encouraged local authorities to show restraint in terms of ARV increases, in order to support local businesses, and local authority members have generally responded very positively.    </p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. The purpose of revaluation is not to increase the overall rates take and therefore after a revaluation of a local authority area the Minister may set a Rates Limitation Order to ensure that the overall rates collected in the area doesn&rsquo;t increase beyond normal inflation. </p>  <p>  To date, revaluations have been fully completed in 16 local authorities, a further 8 are being completed and the final tranche should be completed by 2021. At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal. Interestingly, in terms of revaluations to date, I understand that  the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease. </p>  <p>  Where ratepayers have legitimate issues in paying their rates liability, local authorities will work with them to facilitate flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay.  The 2019 Act will further facilitate this flexible approach once ratepayers engage with the local authority. Importantly, the 2019 Act also provides for new Rates Vacancy Abatement and Rates Alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and/or local policy objectives.  This will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and rate-payers.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p>  <p>  Under sections 18A and 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a housing authority may issue an Improvement Notice or Prohibition Notice, respectively, where a property is found to be non-compliant.  Under Section 34 of that Act, any person who by act or omission contravenes the Regulations, fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, will be guilty of an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.  If an inspection identifies that a property has been found to be non-compliant with the regulations, it is a matter for the local authority to determine what action is necessary and appropriate, including the issuing of an Improvement Letter, Improvement Notice, Prohibition Notice or further legal recourse.  </p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of the commencement of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. HAP may be provided on a property which is the subject of a subsisting improvement notice under section 18A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. HAP shall not be, or shall cease to be, provided on a property which is the subject of proceedings or a prohibition notice under section 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a prohibition notice has come into effect, HAP may continue to be paid for 13 weeks from the date of HAP commencing or the notice coming into force, as appropriate.</p>  <p>   Section 62 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 - 2019 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, in accordance with the grounds for terminations set out in the table to section 34 of the Acts.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 enhances further the security of tenure for tenants by providing the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with new powers to investigate and sanction improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions; and requiring landlords to copy a tenancy termination notice to the RTB. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 also provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he/she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish/renovate the property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant who provides their contact details, upon completion of the works. Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate from a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment/renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such  a risk would be likely to exist for at least 3 weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the effectiveness and enforcement of the security of tenure provision in the Acts with a view to making any necessary and justifiable amendments.</p></reply>

When the operational procedures for the programme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities. </p>  <p>  To support the delivery of affordable homes to buy or rent the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure support for the delivery of over 6,000 dwellings.  The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was specifically targeted at 11 local authorities, where the greatest affordability pressures exists.  In December 2018, Approval in Principle was announced for funding for 10 infrastructure projects, in Dublin and Cork, with an allocated budget of &euro;43 million. This will support the delivery of approximately 1,400 affordable homes. </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the SSF issued in April 2019 to 19 local authorities. I announced Approval in Principle for 25 infrastructure projects across 13 local authority areas on the 6th August 2019.  This significant funding commitment of &euro;84 million will support the delivery of 1,770 affordable homes for purchase. This announcement means that, to date, funding support has been allocated to enable delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes for purchase under the 2 calls of the Serviced Sites Fund. </p>  <p>  The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery, as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The SSF will also play an important role in making cost rental projects as affordable as possible. My Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental. This is being informed by the learning from two pilot cost rental projects, one of which, at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown, has commenced construction, with first homes anticipated to come on stream from 2021, with a second, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, at an earlier stage.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the Land Development Agency (LDA), which is examining the potential to deliver Cost Rental homes at scale from its land portfolio and the broader State land bank. The initial portfolio of sites that the Agency has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.</p>  <p>  There is also capacity to deliver up to 2,350 further affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands supported through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).  An additional c. 5,600 homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market.</p>  <p>  These schemes will complement other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported some 15,000 households.</p></reply>

This will add to the planning enforcement workload of the affected planning authorities, necessitating dedicated additional staffing and complementary resources.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department wrote to planning authorities on 4 June 2019 seeking estimated resource funding requirements for the implementation and enforcement of the new provisions. My Department wrote again to planning authorities on 2 July 2019 seeking new or revised estimates following my designation of additional Rent Pressure Zones in certain parts of the country, which extended the application of the short-term letting provisions to the new areas. </p>  <p>  Since then, further communication has taken place between my Department and all relevant planning authorities regarding the clarification and refinement of the resourcing requests, as well as in relation to the practical implementation of the short-term letting provisions. As an example, on 2 August last, my Department issued a detailed &ldquo;Guidance Note for Planning Authorities on the Regulation of Short-Term Letting&rdquo; to planning authorities to assist in this regard and to facilitate a consistent approach in the implementation of the provisions.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with relevant planning authorities regarding the implementation and enforcement of the short-term letting legislation. The legislation does not require planning authorities to report statistical information to my Department regarding the receipt of notifications from concerned property owners of the letting of their properties on a home-sharing basis, thereby being eligible to avail of the exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission, or the number of change of use planning applications that have been received further to the commencement of the provisions. However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s provision of enforcement funding, planning authorities will be required to submit an initial progress report six months after the commencement of enforcement activity, and to submit further reports at subsequent appropriate intervals.</p></reply>

As a result, this will see the initial emphasis on major urban areas. While two &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; pilot projects are located in Dublin, it is intended that Cost Rental will become a national scheme, to be delivered at scale over the longer term. </p><p>The following table includes the two Cost Rental &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; pilot projects at Enniskerry Road and St. Michael's Estate. Also included is a site at Shanganagh, where Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is currently working with the Land Development Agency (LDA) to explore the possibility of undertaking a Cost Rental development. The remaining sites comprise the initial portfolio of sites to which the LDA has access. The LDA is very committed to the concept of Cost Rental and it is likely that it will form a significant element of delivery at the majority of these locations.</p><p><table><tr><th>Site Name </th><th>Location </th><th>Local AuthorityArea</th></tr><tr><td>Enniskerry Road</td><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>DLR County Council </td></tr><tr><td>St. Michael's Estate </td><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>Dublin City Council</td></tr><tr><td>Shanganagh Castle </td><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>DLR County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Skerries </td><td>Dublin- non local authority</td><td>Fingal County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Naas </td><td>Kildare- non local authority</td><td>Kildare County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Dundrum </td><td>Dublin - non local authority</td><td>DLR  County Council </td></tr><tr><td>St Kevin's </td><td>Cork- non local authority</td><td>Cork County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Cherry Orchard </td><td>Dublin- non local authority</td><td>Dublin City Council </td></tr><tr><td>St Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens </td><td>Dublin - non local authority</td><td>Dublin City Council </td></tr><tr><td>Poolbeg </td><td>Dublin - non local authority</td><td>Dublin City Council </td></tr></table></p><p>In tandem with these pilot projects, my Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental for Ireland.  This requires that serious consideration is given to the many delivery options possible, and the challenges posed, in order to ensure that a coherent Cost Rental model can be delivered at a scale and in a manner that will have the desired positive impact on the Irish housing sector. </p><p>To this end, I have convened a working group within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other expert bodies. This group is developing the policy framework for the broader Cost Rental model and to consider how a sustainable financing structure can be established to then commence delivery of units at the scale required to get this new category of housing off the ground. The work of this group is being assisted by a consultancy and research support that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.</p><p>The selection of further sites for Cost Rental consideration will be informed largely by the financial and operational model that will emerge from this evidence building. Given the 30% affordability requirement that the Government has agreed must be met on State lands that are to be utilised for housing, I anticipate that Cost Rental will have an important role to play in the development of these lands. </p></reply>

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.</p><p>Pension abatement in the public service is structured to ensure that a pensioner's combined earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service retirement pension, does not exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. Depending on those variables, the actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person.  For example, where a person&rsquo;s combined public service earnings from their current job plus pension are less than the current equivalent of their pensionable earnings from their old job e.g. in the Defence Forces, there is no reduction of pension.</p><p>I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle / concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.</p><p>I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment<b></b>immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post/position. However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation.</p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.</p></reply>

The UN is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Our effort to secure a seat, which was announced in 2005, reflects this.  I am particularly conscious that we are seeking a seat on the Council at a time when multilateralism is being undermined.  It is my strong belief that, in these circumstances, it is important that Ireland should demonstrate its willingness to participate in the work of multilateral institutions.  I know this view is widely shared in the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  All appropriate regional, multilateral and bilateral engagements are being utilised by An Taoiseach; me, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; Ministers across Government and by Ministers of State, to promote and discuss Ireland&rsquo;s candidature.  Officials at my Department are also fully engaged in the effort to ensure success.  Ireland last served on the Council from 2001-2002.</p>  <p>  In making our case to the 192 other Members States of the UN, we are highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of active membership. We have a strong record at the UN in the areas of peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights. </p>  <p>  The case for our candidature echoes our policy interests, our values and our history of positive engagement at the global level.  We are committed to the principles and values of the UN Charter which have stood the test of time for 74 years and we will demonstrate this commitment if we are elected to the Council.    </p>  <p>  The contest for the two seats is very competitive.  Our opponents, Canada and Norway, are strong members of the UN and important bilateral partners.  We enjoy excellent relations with both and cooperate on many issues at the UN and beyond.  Indeed, my Norwegian counterpart visited Ireland just last month and I had the opportunity to meet with her to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest. </p>  <p>  Later this month I will travel to the 74th session of the UN General Assembly with the President, and the Taoiseach. The UN is organising five Summits in as many days, addressing Climate, Financing for Development, Health, Small Island Developing States and the Sustainable Development Goals.  In addition to participating in the Summits, we will take the opportunity to raise the profile of our Security Council candidature with Member States. We aim to meet senior representatives of a wide range of States to press our case and seek their support at the election which is expected to take place in June 2020. In addition to those bilateral meetings, the President, Taoiseach and I will participate in events that showcase Ireland's principled and consistent foreign policy on issues such as the Middle East Peace Process, disarmament and the importance of multilateralism. Our programmes will, of course, include a number of events with important bilateral and Irish community dimensions.</p></reply>

This requirement also applies to adult applicants whose most recent passport has expired more than five years previously and to adult applicants whose passport was issued before 1 January 2006 and has been reported as lost, stolen or damaged.  </p>  <p>  The application referred to was registered with the Passport Service in March of this year. The Passport Service did not issue a passport to the applicant on the grounds that the applicant declined to submit a copy of their PSC, which was required for the applicant's specific category of application. The basis for rejecting an application where a PSC is required and not submitted is Sections 6 and 7 the Passports Act, 2008 (as amended) and section 263(3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is aware of the Data Protection Commission&rsquo;s concerns on matters pertaining to the PSC.

Where the applicant does not present their PSC, an application can proceed if an applicant either presents original Government-issued photographic identification, such as a driver&rsquo;s licence or a passport from another country, or attends for interview in person at the Passport Offices in Cork or Dublin. </p>  <p>  Passport Service staff will contact the applicant directly.</p></reply>

In the days and weeks that followed his death, disturbing information came to light that points unequivocally to the fact that Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by agents of the Saudi State. </p>  <p>  In January 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions announced that she would initiate a human rights inquiry, under the terms of her mandate, into the unlawful death of Mr. Khashoggi. The report by Agnes Callamard was published in June. Ms Callamard found that Mr Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated extrajudicial execution, for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible. </p>  <p>  The report was discussed during an Interactive Dialogue with Ms Callamard at the Human Rights Council on Wednesday 26 June. An EU statement thanked Ms Callamard for her report, condemned the killing, reiterated that those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi must be held to account, and again called for &lsquo;prompt; effective and thorough; independent and impartial; and transparent investigations&rsquo;. The statement called upon Saudi Arabia to disclose all information available and to fully cooperate with all investigations into the killing. </p>  <p>  Ireland also made a national statement at the dialogue, emphasising the importance of the protection of journalists and media workers, and joined calls that those responsible for the killing must be held to account. Officials from my Department have continued to raise our concerns about this case directly with Saudi officials - most recently with the Saudi Ambassador in Ireland last week - and to press for a transparent legal process. </p>  <p>  In her report Ms Callamard called for the Human Rights Council, the UN Security Council or the UN Secretary-General to conduct an international follow-up criminal investigation for the purpose of determining individual liability and identifying options towards judicial accountability. The call by UN Special Rapporteur will need to be considered in these fora. </p>  <p>   Ireland fully supports a follow up investigation by the Human Rights Council, as called for by Ms Callamard. The Special Rapporteur did not identify the ICC as among the next steps to be considered at this stage. Recourse to the International Criminal Court is only possible in certain circumstances and for specific types of crimes.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and unequivocal supporter of a free press. As a global community, protecting journalists and media workers must be an essential component of our efforts to protect and promote freedom of expression.</p></reply>

I have expressed deep concerns, in this House, in multilateral fora, and directly to Saudi officials, about the way in which the war in Yemen is conducted, by all parties. My Department has also consistently highlighted these concerns in our bilateral contacts with a number of third states which are involved in the conflict, including Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iran. </p>  <p>  We have emphasised the need for an end to human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, and for full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access. Most recently, my officials raised our concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi Ambassador, in a meeting last week. </p>  <p>  The promotion of human rights is a key element in Irish and EU foreign policy, and there are of course many states around the world in relation to which Ireland and the EU have human rights concerns. In addressing these, we need to tailor the different approaches available to us to different contexts, according to what is most likely to be effective. </p>  <p>  Restrictive measures or 'sanctions' are one potential tool of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Care needs to be taken to avoid counterproductive impacts of sanctions, including due to the potential they have to isolate the target country from the kinds of interactions where diverse views are expressed, and minds changed. In most cases, public and private diplomacy is the preferred approach. </p>  <p>  There have previously been calls in this house for an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia in light of that country&rsquo;s involvement in the war in Yemen. Some, though not all, of the EU Member States which have arms industries have decided to halt arms exports to countries involved in the Yemen conflict. Although EU consensus on a full EU arms embargo does not currently exist, all EU Member States have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty. </p>  <p>  The Treaty exists to ensure that arms sales do not fuel conflicts, lead to serious violations of international human rights law, or allow arms to fall into the hands of non-state actors or terrorists. It is often more effective to press for the implementation of commitments already made, reminding partners of what they have agreed to, rather than seeking agreement on new measures. Ireland&rsquo;s efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of the Treaty.</p></reply>

I continued this engagement over the summer months and I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith, meeting most recently earlier this week, to work to secure agreement between the parties to get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. </p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process with that objective over the last number of months. Progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The awful murder of Lyra McKee and the outpouring of public feeling that followed demands a serious response at political level. People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and deal with the issues and challenges that Northern Ireland faces at present, not least the difficulties raised by the UK exit from the European Union. The functioning of the North South Ministerial Council is also urgently required, to bring together the Executive and the Government to oversee and develop co-operation on the island, and as a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties, in particular the two largest parties, must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again. </p>  <p>  This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. Accordingly, the Government will continue to do everything possible to support continuing engagement and progress in discussions between the political parties, working with the UK Government in any scenario, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

I have reviewed the Statement, along with my officials, and would make the following observations. </p><p>Firstly, I would welcome the Council&rsquo;s assessment that Government revenues continue to perform well this year to date. With tax receipts to end-August in line with expectations and showing year-on-year growth of 8.1%, it looks likely that our Budget 2019 target of &euro;57.9 billion will be achieved. </p><p>I also note the Council&rsquo;s concerns around a &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo; and in line with this view, last week I secured Government agreement to base Budget 2020 on this same assumption, that of a no-deal Brexit. In fact, given the uncertainty and lack of clarity regarding the timing and format that the U.K.&rsquo;s exit will take, preparing for a no-deal scenario is the most sensible approach. This, I believe, will help us to ensure that we safeguard our recent hard won progress in stabilising the public finances. </p><p>In addition, it is important that we avoid a situation whereby decisions are made this year that may need to be reversed in the future. By assuming a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo;, we can ensure that the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge; whilst also preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances.</p><p>Finally, it is important to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo; and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario. </p><p>Indeed, by continuing to balance our books, reduce our debt burden and build up the Rainy Day Fund, we are improving our resilience to the risks posed by Brexit and other risks that a small open economy such as ours faces.</p></reply>

This means that not all properties that are affected by pyrite are eligible for the exemption. Under the relevant legislation, a  property that has been damaged by pyrite is eligible for the LPT exemption where any one of the following conditions is met: </p><p>1. A certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person, </p><p>2. It has been accepted into the pyrite remediation scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board,</p><p>3. An insurance company has remedied it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation, or</p><p>4. The builder who built the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation. </p><p>Property owners claiming the exemption under 1. above must provide a certificate to Revenue, which is completed in accordance with  I.S. 398-1.2013 as set down by the then Minister for the<b></b>Environment, Community and Local Government<b></b>in Statutory Instrument (SI) No 147 of 2013. Property owners claiming the exemption under 2. to 4.  above must provide appropriate supporting documentation. </p><p>Once granted, the exemption becomes applicable from the following 1 November and normally remains in place for a period of six years. The Finance (Local Property tax) Act 2012 (as amended) does not provide entitlement to the exemption for any years previous to a property being accepted as having significant pyritic damage, or in circumstances where the pyritic damage was remediated prior to the introduction of LPT on 1 July 2013. </p><p>However, usually the presence of pyrite, whether it has already caused structural damage to a property or has the potential to cause such damage, will have a negative effect on the market value of the property. This may result in a reduced LPT liability for the affected property, depending on the chargeable value that was declared for the property for LPT purposes on the current valuation date of 1 May 2013.</p></reply>

The criteria for these differed to the exemptions available for LPT. Property owners were obliged to submit claims and HHC waivers/exemptions were granted or refused by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) or the relevant Local Authorities. Revenue became responsible for the collection of HHC arrears, with effect from July 2013, but did not take on responsibility for the administration of exemptions or waivers. Data in respect of exemptions/waivers granted/refused is available from the Local Government Management Agency.  </p><p>The number of exemptions fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including the receipt of new claims, the termination of existing exemptions or the amendment of claims.

This meant that, where it could be reasonably facilitated, an employer processing a retirement application might allow a retiree to forego less valuable pension service so that more valuable service (within the overall allowable limit) might be availed of. Where a pension had already come into payment, the member would make an appropriate recoupment to the relevant pension scheme. </p>  <p>  As a result of a number of issues that have arisen in relation to the benefit cap and implementation of Circular 15/2016, my Department has carried out a review into the operation of those provisions. As part of the review, further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General has been sought. Once that advice has been received, new/revised guidance will be developed and issued as appropriate.  At that stage, public service employers and pension administrators will be in a position to consider the implications for the pension entitlements of affected individuals under their pension schemes, and to communicate with those individuals accordingly.</p></reply>

The function of the sluice outfall allows the discharge of water from the area protected by the embankment to the estuary, and during high tides prevents tidal waters in the estuary backing up in to the protected area. </p><p>While repair works had started in mid-August, due to forecast high tides emergency repairs works were carried out on Friday 30th and Saturday 31stAugust.  Unfortunately, these temporary works failed and water breached the embankments.</p><p>The OPW has now reconstructed an embankment at the breached area for the short term and is currently considering options for the construction of a permanent structure for the long term.  </p><p>The OPW acknowledges that in trying to repair the damage to the sluice, the temporary structures did not initially provide the level of protection provided by the embankments and did lead to flooding in the area.</p><p>The OPW were in contact with the local authority over the weekend in question and sandbags were provided to the affected houses.  Several pumps were also deployed to the area. </p><p>In relation to the five houses directly affected, four families were evacuated to a nearby hotel over the weekend of Saturday 31st August and Sunday 1stSeptember. The OPW has met with and written to these homeowners and apologised for the damage to their house and contents caused by this exceptional situation. </p><p>The OPW has engaged a loss adjuster to help establish the quantum of costs in restoring the houses and contents affected to their pre flooding position. The loss adjuster visited these five houses on Thursday 5thSeptember. The OPW has advised the homeowners that while this is an independent assessment, the OPW appreciates that some homeowners have engaged their own loss assessor and the OPW will cover the cost for that service. </p><p>The OPW will fund the costs of alternative accommodation, if needed, for the duration of restoration works. </p><p>The loss adjuster has also visited the sporting facilities affected and is working to establish the quantum of costs involved in restoring these facilities to their pre flooding position.</p><p>I visited the area on Sunday 1stSeptember and met with those affected and I am anxious that an early resolution for all those directly affected by this flood event is found without delay.  </p><p>I want to take this opportunity to again thank the affected homeowners for their ongoing co-operation.</p></reply>

The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) works with schools through the DES Continuum of Support framework.  The NEPS Model of Service works through a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils. NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.</p>  <p>  DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage. DEIS provides additional supports, through the DEIS School Support Programme, to schools identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged communities.  Schools can use these additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort, including the additional needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness.     </p>  <p>  DEIS Schools can also avail of Home School Community Liaison and School Completion supports provided by Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service in relation to school attendance, retention and progression which can be areas of particular challenge to pupils experiencing homelessness.

This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where the NCSE identifies need.  The NCSE works with families and schools to ensure that advance planning is in place so that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation provides for a very transparent series of steps which can ultimately lead to the issuing of a legally binding direction to a board of management.</p>  <p>  The initial step in the process is for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to inform the Minister that there is a shortage of places in a particular area.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE will only activate the legislation after it has taken all reasonable efforts to get schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide additional special class or school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was formally activated for the first time on April 18th following a report from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) outlining insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15 and North Kildare.  This followed extensive interaction between the NCSE, schools and my Department.</p>  <p>  The shortage of places in North Kildare was resolved and additional post primary classes will open in 2020/21.</p>  <p>  In relation to Dublin 15, the specific provision required was 8 additional primary Autism special classes providing 46 places and 40 special school places for students with complex needs.</p>  <p>  New classes which will be coming on stream over coming weeks are the result of very intense engagement between the Department, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), Patron bodies and schools.</p>  <p>  This follows the establishing of a Special School for up to 40 children in Dublin 15, under the patronage of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB.</p>  <p>  As the new places come on stream in Dublin 15 over coming weeks, the NCSE will work closely with the Schools and the Parents of the children concerned to ensure there is a planned approach to the start-up of the new school and classes.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has also indicated that some parents in South Dublin and Cork are experiencing difficulty securing school places for their children.  It worked with schools over the last school year to establish 7 additional special classes and, since June 2019, established a further 6 special classes.  This has created an additional 54 places in primary autism special classes and an additional 24 places in post primary autism special classes. NCSE continue to work with schools and has advised my Department that the legislation may need to be invoked in the near future, if sufficient schools do not respond voluntarily.</p>  <p>  NCSE were aware of increased demand for special classes in Cork and have established 24 special classes for Setember 2019, creating over 140 additional special class places in Cork.  In total there are 190 special classes in Cork.</p>  <p>  At end of the school year in June 2019, NCSE was aware of 20 children in Cork seeking a special class or special school placement. At that time, there were approximately 60 specialist education places vacant in Cork and NCSE has worked during the school holidays to match children with suitable class places. Schools will confirm special class and school enrolments to NCSE this month and NCSE will review the final position.</p>  <p>  NCSE is aware of a number of children still seeking specialist places and continues to work with schools and their patrons to establish additional provision.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is actively engaging at local level with schools, Patron Bodies and the families concerned to resolve the issues involved as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  If, following completion of that work, the NCSE establishes that there is a shortage of places in either area it can inform the Minister thereby activating the provisions contained in section 37A of the Education Act 1998.</p></reply>

The main objective of the Department's statutory based Student Grant Scheme is to provide assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold or in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme contains a number of qualifying thresholds for various grant values. These gradations allow students just over a threshold margin, to remain in receipt of a grant, albeit at a reduced rate that reflect their relative income vis-&agrave;-vis other applicants. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme also provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families. </p>  <p>  The assessment of means under my Department's Student Grant Scheme is based on gross income from all sources, with certain social welfare and health service executive payments being exempt. While the Affordable Childcare Scheme has both universal and means-tested elements, the Student Grant Scheme is entirely means-tested.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the funding allocation for student grants is determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments.  As such, it would not be appropriate to comment on specific issues or proposals including those relating to student grants at this stage. However, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2020, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</p></reply>

As of 8 September 2019, 7,306 persons were being provided with accommodation by my Department. Currently, there are 6,056 persons residing in the 38 accommodation centres located nationwide. As the centres are at full capacity, there are also a further 1,250 applicants residing in 33 emergency accommodation locations in hotels and guest houses. </p>  <p>  In terms of the right to work, holders of a labour market access permission already have a very broad and generous access to employment and self-employment. Eligible applicants have access to all sectors of employment, with the exception of the Civil and Public Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Defence Forces and Embassies or consulates accredited to the State. The exclusion of these employments is largely due to their requirement for long-term residence in the State or EU/EEA citizenship. There is no minimum or maximum salary threshold associated with the permission, no language requirement/assessment, and no evidence of a job offer is required before a permission is granted. There is no restriction with regard to temporary or permanent jobs, nor to full-time or part-time work. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to reducing the time that it takes to process applications for international protection. This is to ensure that we can identify at the earliest possible stage those who are in need of our protection and those who can safely return to their country of origin.</p>  <p>  We provide access to the labour market if a person is waiting more than nine months without a first instance recommendation on their application. This is in full compliance with the provisions of the current EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive.  Where a person does not have clarity on their status in the State within this period, it is reasonable to allow them to access the labour market.  </p>  <p>  A High Level Interdepartmental Group has been established in my Department, chaired by one of our Deputy Secretary Generals, to review the Direct Provision system in its entirety, including the interaction between labour market participation and the Direct Provision system. We are mapping a plan for immediate improvements and for medium to long-term transitional change. </p>  <p>  Last month, we published agreed National Standards for accommodation centres. The Standards will apply to all service providers contracted by the Department to operate and manage accommodation centres. They provide a framework for the continued development of services and supports for residents by improving the quality of care and ensuring consistency across the centres.</p></reply>

I am advised that no decision has been taken as yet in relation to accommodation in the Western region for which eight bids were received. Therefore it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the evaluation process is ongoing.  When the evaluation and other commercially sensitive aspects of the process are completed, the Department will begin engagement with local communities and their political representatives.  I am not in a position at present to say when the evaluation process will conclude. </p>  <p>  I appreciate that local communities have many questions when they hear that a centre may be opening in their area. We already have a network of 38 centres across 18 counties. In all cases, there is positive engagement between residents and local communities including through the Friends of the Centre Groups. These Groups promote integration across the communities and are a valuable support to residents and to centre managers and staff.</p>  <p>  In terms of local services and supports, once it is confirmed that an accommodation centre is opening in an area, my Department links in with the other State service providers to ensure that all the necessary supports are put in place. Where GP lists are full, the HSE will arrange for access to GPs who have availability in the surrounding area. The Department of Education and Skills ensures access to schools for children and, if required, school transport.  Children also have access to the free pre-school scheme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides a weekly personal allowance to each resident and covers any exceptional needs.

The Oireachtas took the necessary decision to opt in in June this year.</p>  <p>  I would add that in practice, Eurojust's primary role is in assisting in clearing difficulties and logjams that arise in multi-national criminal investigations and dealing with mutual legal assistance requests for evidence and surrenders under the European Arrest Warrant.  The location of EU prosecutors under one roof at Eurojust facilitates the rapid exchange of information and addressing of issues of relevance. The agency makes a valuable contribution in this regard.</p></reply>

In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted.  The Act also increases the range of conditions that may be attached to bail, in relevant cases. </p>  <p>  However as the Deputy will be aware, a decision to grant or refuse bail in any particular case is a matter for the courts, which are independent in the exercise of judicial functions subject to the Constitution and the law.  </p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual case such as that referred to.</p></reply>

In relation to the safety of e-cigarettes the HIQA assessment concluded that this remains an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on long-term safety has yet to be established.</p>  <p>  Although the HIQA assessment was published only in 2017, the research on e-cigarettes is rapidly evolving. In that context, in March this year I asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence in relation to the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. The evidence review is expected to be completed in March 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor developments and publications by authoritative bodies internationally on the safety of e-cigarettes and whether they facilitate smoking cessation.</p>  <p>  E-cigarettes are regulated under the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 271/2016). These Regulations transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014/40/EU).</p>  <p>  Under these Regulations health warnings which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are mandatory. The Regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers.</p>  <p>  Finally the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturers, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.</p>  <p>  Later this month I intend to bring forward a draft scheme for a Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which will include provisions to:</p>  <p>  - introduce a new licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes.</p>  <p>  - prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons under the age of 18.</p>  <p>  - prohibit the sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products by persons under the age of 18.</p></reply>

The Committee makes 11 main recommendations, which include proposals both related to broad policy objectives and more technical amendments.  Given the comprehensive scope of the legislation and the ethical, legal and social issues which arise from AHR practices, it is anticipated that certain areas of the General Scheme will require further consideration and refinement during the ongoing process of drafting the bill.  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report and its recommendations will be considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, officials in my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, are developing a model of care for infertility and an associated public fund for AHR.  This work includes developing proposals on the allocation of the &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to AHR which was announced in December 2018.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, options in relation to the parameters of any potential public funding model, including what eligibility criteria may be included, are still under consideration, and an announcement will be forthcoming once the relevant decisions have been finalised.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish Public Health Service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  I understand that the impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of these schemes is not insignificant.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the development of a model of care for infertility will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon will also be using the provisions laid down in the newly signed Greyhound Racing Act 2019 to improve the traceability of greyhounds and there will be a review of how exchequer funding is allocated within Bord na gCon, with a view to refocusing the industry on welfare issues.</p>  <p>  The ICC has assured my Department that it has systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing. Hares can only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC, in accordance with the terms of two licences granted by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  These licences contain 26 conditions which have been refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare. These include a variety of measures, including a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours. </p>  <p>  The ICC also attends to the welfare of the hare and undertakes a range of actions to address issues related to health and welfare. Coursing clubs are required to comply with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Committee on Coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing and, in that regard, the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds. </p>  <p>  The licence for the 2019/2020 coursing season has been suspended by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht due to the outbreak of the RHD2 virus and that department continues to monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is critically important that those involved in coursing operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and that the welfare of both hares and greyhounds is prevalent at all times. </p></reply>

This reflects our three pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production. This plan sets an ambitious target for the sector to reduce its emissions to between 17.5 and 19 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e by achieving between 16.5 and 18.5 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e over the period 2021-2030. </p><p>These targets are not without its challenges but the Teagasc MACC report illustrates a suite of actions that provide opportunity for emissions reductions and a pathway towards achieving our commitments.</p><p>To reach the target of 19 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in 2030 requires us to manage the emissions profile from the sector between now and then through mobilisation of as many of these actions as possible as early as possible with high levels of take-up across our 139,000 farms.  The CCAC report highlights the importance of early adoption by farmers of the measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan.  All mechanisms, such as the CAP reform, market incentive and regulation will also be investigated in full by all the relevant stakeholders, including industry, to mobilise the necessary actions as swiftly as possible. </p><p>The next Common Agriculture Policy will be fully aligned with this need to prioritise climate action. There will be a step up in environmental and climate delivery in the next CAP.The development of our CAP strategic plan will ensure the delivery of this target. A consultation process on the next CAP has already started and negotiations on CAP policy will intensify over the coming months. </p></reply>

However, meat processors do make in-spec bonus payments in respect of cattle which meet certain market specifications demanded by retail customers.  The 30 month age limit to which you refer is one such specification. It is entirely a commercial matter and is not a condition imposed by my Department. </p><p>It should be noted however that almost all third countries have a 30 month age limit in respect of imports and this will be specified in the veterinary health certificate which will accompany the product. These requirements are a matter for the authorities in those countries.</p><p>On 15 September,  I announced that agreement had been reached between Meat Industry Ireland and farm organisations and representatives (IFA, ICMSA, ICSA, Macra na Feirme, INHFA, the Beef Plan Movement and Independent Farmers of Ireland) on a two strand agreement for the reform of the Irish Beef Sector. </p><p>Two elements of this relate specifically to the 30 month age limit: </p><p>- the introduction of a new bonus of 8c/kg for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months, which meet all non-age related existing in-spec criteria, and which up to now have not received any bonus;</p><p>- an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector.</p><p>The entry into force of the Agreement is contingent on the cessation of all protests and blockades.  All parties to the Agreement agreed to recommend it to those they represent. The future of the beef sector is now in the balance, and I would appeal to all those still protesting to step back, for the sake of their fellow farmers.</p></reply>

Market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the agri-food sector, particularly for the beef sector. </p><p>My Department is continuously working towards opening and enhancing market access for Irish beef to key markets outside the EU.</p><p>In April 2017, I launched a seven-point action plan on market access. This is being implemented through a variety of actions, including:</p><p>- A  market prioritisation exercise and subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of my Department. The countries selected for a detailed examination of their meat markets were Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia;</p><p>- A market access web portal which was launched in May 2018 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. It provides a wide range of valuable information on potential market opportunities to exporters</p><p>- An enhanced programme of Ministerial agri-food trade missions, in cooperation with Bord Bia and other State agencies.</p><p>Market access, both for beef and for live exports, has been a feature of these missions and over the last two and a half years, trade missions have focused on key growth markets such as:</p><p>- Asia: China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia;</p><p>- North America: USA, Mexico and Canada;</p><p>- The Gulf States and Turkey.</p><p>These missions feature high level political meetings as well as promotion opportunities for Irish beef and serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in those destinations.</p><p>Since the Brexit vote in 2016, I have allocated significant additional funding to Bord Bia to enable it develop new markets and enhance existing ones. Bord Bia&rsquo;s total grant in aid for 2019 is &euro;46.6 million, representing a 60% increase in funding for the marketing and promotion of our food offering over five years. </p><p>The approach of my Department and Bord Bia for market development is a combination of targeted research, high-level diplomacy, consultation with important agri-food stakeholders and co-operation with officials in competent authorities abroad. This approach serves to make the most effective use of available resources and to maximise opportunities for market access. </p><p>Since April 2017, agreement has been secured for the export of beef to several new third country markets, including:</p><p>- Beef (frozen boneless, under 30 months) to China</p><p>- Beef (as well as pork) to Ukraine</p><p>- Beef (as well as sheepmeat and poultry) to Qatar and Kuwait</p><p>Furthermore, during this period, enhanced beef access was agreed with Japan, Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. </p><p>While the role of my Department is to secure market access for the industry, it is ultimately up to food business operators, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to exploit these opportunities. </p></reply>

This includes monitoring the international disease situation, working with international partners and the implementation of an intensive communications campaign around the disease risk. This campaign aims to provide all relevant stakeholders including farmers, vets, hauliers and the general public with the information they need to play their part in protecting the national pig herd against the introduction of ASF into this country.   </p>  <p>  A specific awareness campaign reminding everyone that the feeding of food waste containing meat products to pigs is prohibited was recently launched. This is a particularly important point as the ASF virus is robust and can survive for months, even years, in pork and pork products and the feeding of food waste to pigs is known to have caused outbreaks of ASF in Asian countries.  The key message is that it is vital that all food waste is disposed of safely away from pigs.  </p>  <p>  Checks for illegal food products are also carried out by my Department in conjunction with Revenue at ports and airports using a targeted, risk-based approach. Manual checks along with a trained food detector dog and scanning equipment is used at Dublin airport to detect food in luggage, for example. </p>  <p>  My Department also has a contingency plan in place for ASF to enable us to respond rapidly and effectively to any potential outbreak.</p></reply>

Officials of my Department have also been working to enhance the online application system, with regard to Appropriate Assessment procedures.  I am confident that these changes will enhance the afforestation application system.</p><p>Following receipt of an application, my Department conducts an initial check to ensure that all relevant details have been submitted as required.  The date an application is advertised on my Department&rsquo;s website is the date that complete information has been received in relation to an application. The tables below indicate timeframes from the date advertised to the date of decision.  Accurate data is available and provided here since the start of the current Forestry Programme, when the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme commenced in January 2015.</p><p>The following table shows the shortest, longest and average time in days for a decision on an afforestation application. The Deputy should be aware that, in some cases, my Department requests further information from the applicant.  In the case below of the application that took 1,119 days for a decision, for example, the applicant was asked to provide further information, but despite numerous follow-up letters, did not respond for many months.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Shortest</th><th>Longest</th><th>Average</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>5</td><td>522</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3</td><td>680</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>3/30*</td><td>1,119</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>30</td><td>959</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>2019 to 31st August</td><td>30</td><td>826</td><td>139</td></tr></table></p><p>* Note from the commencement of the Forestry Act, 2014, on 24 May, 2017, the shortest time before a decision is 30 days.  However, some applications would have been decided in a shorter timeframe from January to 23<sup>rd</sup>May that year.</p></reply>

The company provides approximately 1,000 direct jobs at present, which in turn supports at least another 1,000 indirect jobs.    In its strategy to exit peat, Bord na M&oacute;na envisages the development and scaling up of new business opportunities to ensure the future commercial viability of the company and enable it to continue to fulfil its mandate to be an employer of scale in the Midlands. This strategy is aimed at developing a transition from peat to sustainable new businesses which utilise the vast landbank over the period to 2028. ESB is also fully committed to the process to lead decarbonisation in Ireland. </p>  <p>  On 23 July An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused ESB planning permission to continue operating West Offaly Power station beyond the end of 2020. ESB's application sought planning permission for the plant to co-fire peat and biomass out to the end of 2027. ESB are currently evaluating An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision. ESB have also submitted to Longford County Council a planning application to continue operating Lough Ree Power station beyond the end of 2020. A decision by Longford County Council is expected shortly. </p>  <p>  Following this decision my Department and I are intensively assessing the options to ensure a just transition, if an earlier exit from peat than planned is required. </p>  <p>  On 31 July I met with the Bord na Mona Board and worker directors, and with Oireachtas Midlands representatives, the Midlands regional transition team, the regional enterprise plan team, and the regional skills fora team. I am scheduled to meet with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this week. </p>  <p>  Several strands are being considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s response: </p>  <p>  -  Bord na Mona diversification </p>  <p>  -  Accelerated programme of bog restoration by Bord na Mona </p>  <p>  -  An area based retrofitting initiative </p>  <p>  -  Other special initiatives for regional development </p>  <p>  I have secured the inclusion of the Midlands in the Platform for Coal and Other Carbon-Intensive Regions in Transition, which supports regions affected by climate policy. Following a letter I wrote to Commissioner Canete in March seeking the inclusion of the Midlands Region under the Platform, the Commissioner confirmed in July that the region would be included. </p>  <p>  Membership of the Platform enables the Midlands Region to avail of the support of a dedicated Country Team, comprised of Commission experts, to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation. The Team will also assist in identifying appropriate EU funding opportunities for the Midlands. The meetings of the Platform also enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas between carbon-intensive regions.A preliminary meeting of this Team with officials from relevant Departments and other stakeholders is planned to take place in the middle of October with a view to the Country Team coming to Ireland in November. The already established Midlands Regional Transition Team, led by Offaly County Council, will play a central role in this process as it evolves.</p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group led by Department of An Taoiseach has been established to develop a just transition plan for the Midlands. Clearly this work cuts across a number of Government Departments, including my own Department, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Employment and Innovation, Rural and Community Development, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  I will respond formally to the Deputy's submission in the coming days. </p></reply>

While no new EU funds have so far been set up under this initiative, the Country Team will assist in identifying appropriate EU funding opportunities for the Midlands. </p>  <p>  My Department is in discussions with the EU Commission in relation to the establishment of the dedicated Country Team, and also to define the areas to be included as part of the Midlands region in the context of the Platform. For the purposes of accessing the support of the Platform, the position of my Department is that the Midlands region will include all areas in the Midlands affected by the transition away from peat harvesting.</p></reply>

Under the EU Directive on driving licences and the relevant Irish regulations, driving licences issued by Member States are mutually recognised. The Directive stipulates that a person may not hold more than one driving licence, thus requiring that, in this case, the person must surrender their UK licence when exchanging it for an Irish one. </p>  <p>  While the UK is still a Member State, a person may exchange their UK licence for an Irish licence, as both are EU licences. When a Member State licence is presented here for exchange, the licensing authority of that Member State is notified that the licence has been exchanged for an Irish licence.</p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit the driving licence of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive here in Ireland on that licence. </p>  <p>  Legislation in the Road Traffic Acts allows for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes. If there is a no deal Brexit, the UK becomes a 3rd country and the potential then exists for arrangements to be made under this legislation. Ireland will be actively pursuing this option however, this may take a little time to complete as it involves a formal agreement and legislation here in Ireland. However, the same principle applies regarding one licence being exchanged for another.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that the National Childcare Scheme will launch on 29th October 2019 and income-assessed subsidies will be available to families with children aged between 24 months and 15 years. This is a means-tested subsidy and is calculated based on a family's circumstances. The rate will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family.

I have allocated significant funding in recent years for this purpose and for improving the quality of infrastructure nationwide.</p>  <p>  Capital strands are made available to achieve the strategic priorities for the year as determined by the Department, having regard to the funding available, developed using analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, learnings from previous capital programmes and feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers and Pobal. </p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the Capital programmes are necessarily a budget limited exercise. Therefore, the maximum grant size available under each of these strands has been determined in consideration of both optimising what can be delivered by each individual grant, as well as maximising the amount of providers and children that will ultimately benefit from the funding. The maximum grants available under this year's capital programmes will not be subject to change. </p>  <p>  Whilst there are no other capital funding programmes available in 2019, planning for 2020's Capital offering is currently underway and the details of this will be communicated to providers in due course.

In this way, the Scheme aims to combat poverty traps and to make work pay for parents. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. Families can continue to access their current targeted supports, remaining on their current payment, until the end of August 2020. In addition, my officials are undertaking further analysis to identify if any refinements are required to the NCS in order to ensure that it fully achieves its aim to deliver quality, accessible, affordable childcare for families in Ireland.  This analysis is currently informing some of the Department's priorities for the Estimates / Budget 2020 process.</p>  <p>  The Department is also committed to a review of the Scheme 12 months after the first subsidy payments begin.</p></reply>

The scheme is operated on my Department's behalf by Pobal, via a nationwide network of community organisations.</p>  <p>  Following a review, a new version of the scheme was launched on 1st November 2017. A number of important new changes were introduced, including an extension of the eligibility criteria to include older people who live on their own for long periods during the day, and the introduction of free monitoring for the first year, following which a small charge will apply. </p>  <p>  One of the eligibility requirements of the scheme is that the applicant is able to benefit from the equipment supplied.</p>  <p>  I understand that the application by the person concerned was received by Pobal on 9 August 2019 and was approved the same day.  Following receipt of a call from the applicant, the supplier followed up the application with the community organisation on 5 September asking for details to be forwarded.  An engineer attended the installation on Monday 9 September.  However, technical difficulties were encountered in installing the system.  Neither the engineer nor the applicant&rsquo;s telephone provider were able to establish a connection, as an analogue connection is required to install the landline unit. </p>  <p>  A number of potential solutions have been proposed to the applicant to be able to avail of the scheme. Where a suitable landline connection is not available, a mobile GSM unit can be installed. This would incur a cost to keep the SIM card in credit similar to the cost incurred for fixed line rental on a landline.</p></reply>

Two carers who are providing care on a part-time basis in an established pattern can also share a single CA payment and the annual Carer's Support Grant (CSG). Each carer must be providing care from Monday to Sunday but can do so on alternate weeks. All other qualifying conditions for CA must also be met.</p>  <p>  An application for CA was received from the person concerned on 5 February 2019 which stated that she was sharing care for the care recipient every second week.</p>  <p>  The application was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) on 17 June 2019 to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied. </p>  <p>  As full-rate CA was already paid to the second carer, the person concerned was contacted by telephone to explain that an overpayment would arise for the original carer, if CA was awarded from date of application. It was proposed to award CA from a current date, which the person concerned accepted. CA was awarded on 13 September 2019 with effect from 19 September 2019.  The first payment will issue to her nominated bank account on 19 September 2019.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The enforcement of the obligation on parents to maintain their children is a matter for the Department Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of means tested social assistance payments.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test for these payments takes account of the income and assets of the person and a spouse/partner, if applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.</p>  <p>  For social assistance schemes, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one-parent family payment, disability allowance and the state pension non-contributory, maintenance payments (including maintenance payments made to or in respect of a qualified child) are assessed by first disregarding any housing costs incurred (up to &euro;4,952 per annum or &euro;95.23 per week), and then assessing the remainder at 50%.  Budget 2019 introduced a maintenance payment disregard for the Working Family Payment (WFP). With a value of &euro;95.23 per week, this brings WFP into line with other social assistance schemes.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total value of any maintenance payments is never assessed as means for these weekly income support payments. Therefore, the total income received by the family (social welfare payment and maintenance payment combined) will be higher than someone not receiving maintenance payments.</p>  <p>  The purpose of means testing is to ensure that resources are targeted to those with the greatest financial need.  The current method of means assessment ensures that appropriate levels of support are available to those who need them, across the wide range of income supports available from my Department.  </p>  <p>  Customers should always advise my Department of any change in their circumstances and their means may be reviewed if necessary.  For example, a customer in receipt of OFP who was previously in receipt of maintenance which has ceased should seek to have that maintenance reinstated and where this is not possible the customer should bring this to the attention of the relevant Officer(s) in my Department who may review the payment.</p></reply>

The right to housing assistance is referred to in Article 34(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union dealing with social security and social assistance and it provides that:</p>  <p>  In order to combat social exclusion and poverty, the Union recognises and respects the right to social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient resources, in accordance with the Rules laid down by Union law and national laws and practices.</p>  <p>  The Charter rights are subject to certain limits and many of these rights and principles are defined by reference to existing law and practice at the EU or national level.  In accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, its provisions are addressed to the EU institutions and &ldquo;to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law&rdquo;.  The Court of Justice has clarified this means that the fundamental rights guaranteed in the legal order of the European Union are &ldquo;applicable in all situations governed by European Union law, but not outside such situations.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  In Ireland the many substantive rights regarding housing arising from legislation, including the right to be assessed for social housing support and, if qualified, placed on a waiting list for a social house or to avail of the housing assistance payment and be placed on a transfer list, are entirely consistent with the principles of the Charter.</p>  <p>  The policy of this Government is that housing supports should be provided to those most in need and we do this in a variety of ways through, for example, the provision of the housing assistance payment, the provision of local authority owned housing, the funding of Approved Housing Bodies in the provision of housing supports and the provision of funding for homeless services.  Indeed, it should be noted that the housing budget for 2019 is just under &euro;2.4 billion. This is the highest level of funding ever provided for housing purposes in any given year in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Continued delivery of social housing through Rebuilding Ireland and the development and implementation of further policies and measures as required in the future is the best way to ensure that the State continues to fully meet its obligations to those who need assistance to provide a home for themselves and their families.</p></reply>

The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are, as follows:</p><p>- A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount;</p><p>- Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000;</p><p>- Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p><p>- Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well;</p><p>- For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well. </p><p>Work is at an advanced stage of development for the new scheme. I expect that the process will be substantially completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place.

One of the Recommendations of the Report involved calls for the Irish Film Board - now Screen Ireland - to constitute its Film Forum with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry. While Screen Ireland commenced efforts to constitute the forum in autumn last year, it was unable to do so. There was disagreement between various bodies representing employees and workers in the industry who would not agree to meet and given the contrary positions of the parties who should participate in the Film Forum, Screen Ireland informed the Joint Committee in December that it could not proceed without excluding one or more of the parties who should participate. There was also a concern that rather than providing a mechanism for a collaborative and inclusive approach to develop and exchange ideas to enhance the industry, the forum would instead amount to little more than the airing of disputes and grievances that had previously been raised before the Joint Committee.  As the deputy is aware, disputes and grievances should be dealt with through the formal mechanisms of the State and the Government has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) whose core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services. In the meantime, efforts have continued to identified a way forward that might address concerns raised. I am now advised that following a joint request by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Services, Industry, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU), and Screen Producers Ireland (SPI), the WRC has agreed to undertake an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to:</p>  <p>  - examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure,</p>  <p>  - assessing issues arising (if any), and</p>  <p>  - making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The WRC has published a Workplace Relations Notice on its website, inviting submissions from stakeholders on the above listed matters by 31 October 2019. The results of the audit should inform any further actions that might be taken on the matter of the film forum.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-18a.542.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091800077#WRK01200"><p>The Report of the Joint Committee was launched on 12 July 2018, just a few weeks after the Government published its Audiovisual Action Plan on 27 June 2018.  The Report made 11 Specific Conclusions and Recommendations, many of which complement the actions set out in the Audiovisual Action Plan. In May of this year, the D&aacute;il debated a motion regarding the Report wherein I set out the progress in implementing the recommendations of the Report. </p>  <p>  Recommendations 1, 3, 5, and 11 have been addressed under revisions to the section 481 tax incentive. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 1 sets out that &ldquo;section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish Film Industry. This fact is accepted by the vast majority of the industry&rsquo;s stakeholders. Section 481 will remain central in the industry into the future&rdquo;.   Changes were made to section 481 in the Finance Act 2018, designed to reduce the time required to decide on applications for the relief. Previously, applications were made directly to Revenue. Now, a producer company applies directly to the Department for a certificate stating that the film is to be treated as a qualifying film for the purpose of section 481.  The Finance Act 2018 also made provision for the extension of section 481 tax relief beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024. It also provided for an additional measure, the Regional Film Development Uplift which is a short-term, tapered regional film development uplift commencing at 5%, for films made in an area designated as an assisted region under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2020, 3% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2021, 2% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2022, and reducing to 0% from year 2023 on. The consent of the European Commission to both these state aid measures has now been received and Regulations and a Commencement Order introduced in July 2019 gave effect to these measures. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 3 saw the committee seek &ldquo;the reform of training in the sector to ensure that all training has a recognised qualification where possible, has a beginning and an end, and that trainees are not forced to repeat specific training&rdquo;. The Committee proposed that &ldquo;there be a wider geographical spread of training courses, the introduction of formal apprenticeships and additional finance to improve this training and development.&rdquo; The Regional Uplift measure outlined above is designed to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector and ensure a spread of production activity beyond the current traditional production hubs in Ireland by incentivising the training and development of new, local pools of talent in the film sector in areas outside the current main production hubs.  In the matter of the training requirements of Section 481, changes targeted at improving outcomes have recently been effected and there is now a strong focus on skills development that is linked to quality, and a more expansive range of skills development at all levels, including hard skills, soft skills, future skills, technical skills and leadership skills. As part of these revised requirements, films with eligible expenditure of over &euro;2 million must have their Skills Development Plans agreed in advance with Screen Ireland.   The plans developed by Screen Ireland require applicants to consider carefully the skills needs of the production, the company, the participant and the sector as a whole and to reflect on how the planned activity will address skills needs across different levels and different departments of the production from new entrants, trainees and crew to above the line talent and company leaders. This is designed to move away from a system where individuals are labelled as trainees and go some way towards addressing the concerns that the Committee flagged. In addition, there is considerable work going on in relation to training. Last November, Screen Skills Ireland, the training and skills development division of Screen Ireland held an Education Forum for the audio visual industry, bringing together Screen industry stakeholders, education and trading providers and policy influencers to focus in the skills development challenges and opportunities. This forum was a success and will be repeated in early November this year. In terms of accredited courses, Screen Ireland has submitted two Level 9 courses (Creative Leadership and Advanced Producers) to be developed and certified through Springboard+. These courses are in direct response to one of the recommendations in the Olsberg Report that new business skills courses be generated, specifically focusing on the needs of creative sector companies. Screen Ireland is also developing a certified Level 8 Apprenticeship programme, for the role of CGI Technical Artist, in the animation and related sectors. A network of Regional Skills Fora was created as part of the Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy and provides an opportunity for employers and the education and training system to work together to meet the emerging skills needs of their regions. Regional skills, in conjunction with SOLAS (The Further Education and Training Authority) has introduced a skills initiative &ldquo;Skills for Growth&rdquo; which is designed to make it easier for employers to identity their skill needs and receive guidance on which education and training providers are best suited to their requirements.  Skillnet Ireland, the national agency for the promotion and facilitation of workforce learning in Ireland currently has 23 programmes planned for 2019 that are of relevance to workers in the film industry. These programmes include courses in Business Skills, Leadership and Project management through Animation Skillnet; Design Enterprise Skillnet; Greas&aacute;n Na Me&aacute;n Skillnet; and Screen Skillnet. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 5 outlined that an &ldquo;international comparative study should be constituted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the Section 481 tax credit&rdquo;. Since the  publication of the Report, as part of its work for the Finance Bill 2018, the Department of Finance published its review of the section titled &lsquo;Review IV:  Cost Benefit Analysis of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Film Corporation Tax Credit&rsquo;.  This analysis was the catalyst for the administrative changes to the section 481 application process. I understand that the Department of Finance will conduct a further review in 2020. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 11 called for &ldquo;Public funding and adherence to employment standards&rdquo; to be linked. The Film Regulations 2019, introduced to give effect to changes in the section 481 procedures include a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.  The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer, have in place written policies and procedures in on Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).  The companies are also required to provide details of any Work Place Relations Commission decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. This also addresses Recommendation 2 of the Report which expressed concerns with regard to working terms and conditions. While matters relating to collective bargaining rights of freelance workers do not fall directly under my remit, my Department has used the opportunities presented by the changes made to the section 481 procedures to improve conditions in the industry particularly in relation to training and commitments undertaken by producer companies.  Recommendation 8 also deals with working conditions and more particularly, calls for state support for &ldquo;the precarious existence of actors and sustainable pension structures for workers within the Irish film industry&rdquo;. This comes within the remit of the Minister for   Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who passed legislation in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 in December 2018 which addresses insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. In July this year, I was pleased to join my colleague and Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty TD, in announcing the extension of the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists to the wider Creative Community. This means that from this month on, self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work will be able to focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 called for workers within the craft grades of the industry to have representatives nominated to the Irish Film Board to feed in their perspectives and needs into the industry&rsquo;s development. However, as I set out in May, under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2018, the Board of Screen Ireland as it is now known is not a representative board in the sense of comprising representatives from the various industry sectors:  Section 12 of the Act provides that 7 members shall be appointed to the Board by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the consent of the Minister for Finance for a period of not more than 4 years. When vacancies arise on the Board, they are advertised by the Pubic Appointments Service (PAS) and are open to applications from anyone who meets the requirements as set out by PAS. The next vacancies will arise in March 2020. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 9 sought for the further integration of the film industry on a north/south basis with the creation of formal north/south structures, development plans and investment.  While Screen Ireland is in competition with Northern Ireland Screen in its efforts to attract inward production into the Republic of Ireland, it also regularly cooperates with Northern Ireland Screen in efforts to attract inward production to the island of Ireland. Earlier this year, Screen Ireland announced that, in conjunction with Northern Ireland Screen, it had teamed up with an international sales and film finance company Bankside Films on a joint venture that intends to produce, and fully fund, up to two feature films per year. It targets projects with a budget of up to &euro;1.5 million and creative teams on each project will come from both the north and south.  </p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 saw the Committee call on the Irish Film Board to constitute the Board&rsquo;s Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry while Recommendation 10 called on the unions and the representative organisations to work towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.  As I set out in May, despite efforts made by Screen Ireland, last Autumn, it did not prove possible to constitute a forum of all stakeholders that would adopt a collaborative approach as suggested by the Report. Instead, it seemed that the forum would simply comprise of the airing of disputes and grievances which are more properly dealt with by the State through other mechanisms such as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In recent days, the WRC has announced its intention to conduct an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate. The WRC invites submissions by 31 October 2019 and it is hoped that this audit will provide an appropriate mechanism to progress matters raised in Recommendation 4 and Recommendation 10. In addition, my Department will continue to work through the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it.</p></reply>
