Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the event of a no-deal scenario emerging, the UK will not have ratified the draft Withdrawal Agreement and will not be bound by its terms and in that scenario, non-Irish EU citizens moving to the UK would need to comply with UK immigration rules as they apply at that stage. Further clarity would be required from the UK Government on its approach in this scenario. </p>  <p>  The Political Declaration setting out the framework for the Future EU-UK Relationship, which has been endorsed by the European Council, sets out the ambition of the EU and UK to have a deep and comprehensive partnership, including across a range of areas of importance to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, in order to minimise the impact on our trade and economy and our people.</p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement represents the best way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal which protects the Good Friday Agreement, and will enable both sides to move on to negotiating a deep and comprehensive future partnership. The Government continues to work to this end.</p></reply>

The advertised turnaround time on our website and in all communications with the public for renewal applications made through the Passport Express channel is 15 working days and 20 working days for first time applicants. The Passport Service is currently meeting and in many cases exceeding this target.  There is no backlog in the Passport Express system.</p>  <p>  A range of measures have been undertaken to ensure that we are in this position despite the unprecedented volume of passport applications received so far this year.  These include the recruitment of temporary and permanent staff as well as a number of technological and customer service initiatives. The management of the overall demand for passports is continuously under review to ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet the demand. The Online Passport Renewal service, which was introduced in March 2017 for adults and November 2018 for children, means this cohort of Irish citizens can now renew their passports anywhere in the world, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  The service brings significant benefits with faster turnaround times of 10 working days (excluding postage), with over 50% of applications processed in less than 10 working days. In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is significantly cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications reduced by &euro;5 across all applications types.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-04a.120.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040400041#WRC02200"><p>The proposal by Alberto Costa MP was that the UK Government should seek a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt the section of the Withdrawal Agreement on Citizens&rsquo; Rights even if the British Parliament fails to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. </p>  <p>  While I very much understand and indeed sympathise with Mr Costa's motivation and objectives, I do not believe this particular proposal would be workable. </p>  <p>  It is the EU's view, shared by the Government, that it would not be possible to treat certain aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, in isolation. This would amount to a reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement, and, as the European Council made clear on 21 March, the Withdrawal Agreement is not for renegotiation.</p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement is a carefully balanced and inter-connected legal text. The citizens&rsquo; rights provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement rely on the general rules providing for the governance of the Agreement and the structures underpinning its applicability and enforceability.  </p>  <p>  Equally, the Agreement contains other provisions, outside of &lsquo;Part 2,&rsquo; that are relevant to the protection of other rights of citizens &ndash; for example, on personal data protection, the orderly completion of judicial cooperation procedures in criminal/civil matters, and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Carving out certain provisions, as part of the ring-fencing exercise proposed by Mr Costa, would, therefore, risk the unequal treatment of certain categories of EU and UK citizens.  </p>  <p>  However, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and UK nationals in the EU, remain a priority for the EU, as they have throughout the negotiations. In the event of a no deal scenario, the rights of British nationals residing in the Union will be addressed by each Member State, depending on its national law.  In this context, like Ireland, EU Member States have taken the necessary measures to regularise the position of UK nationals resident in their countries, and to provide them with legal certainty for the longer term.  The Commission has also proposed a number of unilateral contingency measures specifically to address citizens' rights, for example, by agreeing, on a reciprocal basis, that UK citizens will be exempt from the need to have a short-term visa to visit EU countries.</p>  <p>  With regard to Ireland, the rights of UK nationals in Ireland, and Irish nationals in the UK, are dealt with under the Common Travel Area. The Common Travel Area is a long-standing arrangement between the UK and Ireland which means Irish citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens and vice versa.  Both the Irish and UK Governments have committed to the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, and the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this longstanding reciprocal arrangement, in any circumstance. To that end, both Governments have committed to undertaking all the work necessary, including through legislative provision to ensure that the Common Travel Area rights and privileges are protected. Ireland has completed its internal procedures, including with the enactment of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, and I understand that the UK has done likewise.</p></reply>

The violent clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary agrarian communities in Nigeria&rsquo;s Middle Belt region have escalated in recent years and pose a serious challenge to stability and security. </p>  <p>  While the vast majority of herders are Muslim and many of the farmers are Christian, the roots of this violence lie in access to land, in a context of scarce natural resources due to rapid climate change in the Sahel. </p>  <p>  Ireland works bilaterally, within the European Union, and with UN partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups and insecurity. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Abuja actively monitors developments in the country, advises on the humanitarian response, and supports Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN forums. </p>  <p>  The humanitarian situation in Nigeria arising from the Islamist insurgency in the North-East of Nigeria affects millions of people. In 2018, Ireland provided &euro;4.8 million in humanitarian assistance to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region. The EU provided &euro;90 million to the region. Ireland is one of the top ten donors to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which last year allocated &euro;43 million to the Lake Chad region. With humanitarian need likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p>  <p>  This violence is a reminder of the potential of climate change to fuel instability and humanitarian need. In our new international development policy, A Better World, the Government has committed to action to prevent dangerous climate change and to address the needs of those most vulnerable to its effects.</p></reply>

This has included, for example, the visit to Ireland on 4-5 February of the Commission's Brexit Preparedness Group to review our comprehensive, cross-Governmental preparations.</p>  <p>  We are working closely with the Commission on how to mitigate against the negative impact on our trade and economy, and to ensure connectivity with the rest of the EU's Single Market, including via the landbridge.</p>  <p>  More recently, discussions have had an additional focus on how to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border in the case of no deal, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.  Ireland and the EU are at one in our determination to do all we can, deal or no deal, to avoid a hard border and to protect the peace process.</p>  <p>  The latest meeting with the Commission at official level took place in Brussels on Friday, 29 March, and was attended by officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as the Revenue Commissioners.  Discussions will continue this week.</p>  <p>  If the UK decides to leave without the Withdrawal Agreement, initial, temporary arrangements will be required. Such arrangements will be suboptimal compared to the backstop, and, while we are absolutely determined to avoid physical infrastructure at the border, it would be difficult to avoid serious disruption to the functioning of the all-island economy. There are no easy answers. The seamless trade we enjoy today would not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for businesses in Northern Ireland will be lost, at least in the short term.</p>  <p>  For any sustainable long term solution, discussions between the EU, Ireland and the UK will be required, not least given the UK's obligations under the Good Friday Agreement as a co-guarantor of that agreement. For such a solution, it would be impossible to escape the need for close alignment with the Single Market and Customs Union, and the backstop would be the starting point for these discussions.</p>  <p>  This is also why the Withdrawal Agreement is of such importance. It represents the only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal, and we continue to work as a priority to support its ratification.</p></reply>

These benefits in kind can include living or other accommodation, entertainment, domestic or other services, or other benefits or facilities of whatever nature. The charge is limited to the amount of the expense incurred by the body corporate in providing the benefit. </p>  <p>  Section 118 (3)(a) provides for a specific exemption from the charge to tax in respect of living accommodation provided by a body corporate to an employee, if the employee is required by the terms of the employment to live there so that s/he can perform his or her duties properly. However, for the exemption to apply, the accommodation must be provided in accordance with a practice which, before 30 July 1948, commonly prevailed in trades of the class in question in relation to employees of the class in question. Moreover, the exemption does not apply where the employee is a director of the employing body in question, or of another body corporate which controls, or which is controlled by, the employing body. There is no set list of trades or professions which are eligible for this exemption, rather, it is a requirement of the exemption that the employer can prove eligibility if requested by Revenue.</p>  <p>  In relation to Questions 15723/19, 15724/19, 15725/19 and 15738/19, I am advised by Revenue that where an employee is in receipt of a benefit from an employer which is not a taxable benefit, the employer is not required to report the details.

Article 11.1 of this Covenant recognises the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. </p>  <p>  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis, and published a paper on Institutional Investment in the Housing Market in February this year.  The paper is based on CSO data up to 2017, the latest year available. </p>  <p>  While there may be a perception that institutional investors are purchasing large amounts of housing stock, the data show that their activity has been limited in the context of the overall housing market.  In 2017 &mdash; the latest year for which we have data &ndash; firms in this category were net purchasers of just 1 per cent of residential sales, or just over 500 units. Furthermore, from 2010 to 2017, net purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate funds and private equity firms were less than 0.01 per cent of available units, or just 380 units.</p>  <p>  On a national level, institutional investors remain a small minority of landlords.  However, such investors do play an increasingly important role in the private rented sector.</p>  <p>  Institutional investment in apartments is likely to be the driving force behind a significant recent increase in the number of apartment units granted planning permission in Dublin. In the first nine months of 2018, 57 per cent of units that were granted planning permission in Dublin were apartments, or just over 4,000 units. As a comparison, in the three year period between 2015 and 2017 the same amount were completed nationally. </p>  <p>  Increased apartment building is a very positive development, both in terms of boosting overall supply and in relation to the National Planning Framework, which specifically targets more compact growth.</p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of investment in the property sector, tax rules have been introduced to facilitate collective investment and to ensure that tax is imposed on funds deriving value from Irish property. For example, the function of the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) framework is not</p>  <p>  to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are required to distribute 85% of their property profits each year and Dividend Withholding Tax is collected on the distributions.  In Finance Act 2016, Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) provisions were introduced for certain investment funds deriving 25% or more of their value from Irish real estate assets, imposing a Dividend Withholding Tax on distributions to non-resident investors.</p>  <p>  However, as Rebuilding Ireland makes clear, such investment can only be one aspect of a multi-pronged response to addressing current issues in the market.  This is why the Government has provided record funding for social and affordable housing, to improve housing infrastructure and to address homelessness. Such funding has been accompanied by a range of regulatory and policy changes that facilitate increased supply of both owner occupier and rental housing, and policy measures to help contain rental price inflation such as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware the purpose of the Bill is to reform and modernise the law of consumer insurance contracts and to "level the playing field so that the consumer is better equipped to stand up to the insurer". The Bill is based on the 2015 Law Reform Commission Report on Consumer Insurance Contracts.</p>  <p>  At Second Stage the then Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD provided the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;support in principle for the objectives of the Bill&rdquo;. He also noted the intention of the Minister for Finance to submit substantive amendments should the Bill reach Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation that it is proposed to bring forward relates to an amendment to cater for Recommendation 8 of the Motor Report to require insurers to notify and engage with policyholders regarding claims submitted against their policy.  This amendment would also apply to small businesses which have an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less and thus cover much of Recommendation 10 of the Employer/Public Liability Report.  Other possible amendments which may be put forward at Committee Stage are currently being considered.</p>  <p>  The reason the legislative changes are not being drafted as part a new Bill is because both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy see the Consumer Insurance Contract Bill as an ideal vehicle for addressing insurance consumer related issues such as the one referred to above from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective.  In addition, as all parties have worked very constructively together on important insurance legislation such as the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018, and the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 to date, I see no reason why this constructive engagement cannot continue.</p></reply>

In addition, the Central has commented as follows:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;While the strategy and commercial decisions of lenders are ultimately matters for the boards of those lenders, the Central Bank, as supervisor, requires that when loans are sold, all statutory legal protections are met. This includes ensuring the terms of existing restructuring arrangements are honoured.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Where a loan is securitised or sold, that loan must be serviced by a bank, retail credit firm (RCF) or credit servicing firm (CSF) authorised and regulated by the Central Bank. This ensures the protections available to the borrower remain with the loan in all cases, regardless of whether the borrower has an alternative repayment arrangement in place or not. This can be achieved through re-engaging with borrowers; restructures; accounting write-downs; mortgage to rent; engaging through the Insolvency Service; sales and securitisations; and the legal process.&rdquo;</p></reply>

Among these, Recommendation 1 requires the Central Statistics Office to consider the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses with this exercise to commence by the end of Q2 2018, with the CSO to report to my Department with the outcome of its review, and if it considers such an index feasible, make appropriate proposals.  </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) submitted its report to the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) in January 2019 in this regard.  In that report, the CSO identified seven potential methods of collecting price information on liability insurance.  These data collection options were assessed against four criteria: (i) statistical quality, (ii) burden on respondents, (iii) meeting user needs, and (iv) cost.  After analysing each of the options, the CSO found that four options were unfeasible and two further options, while technically feasible, would be extremely difficult to implement in practice.  However, the CSO signalled to the CIWG that it will further examine a method that may be feasible.  I understand that this method would use a commercially available technology solution to automatically price a high volume of representative profiles, i.e., customer profile such as an office-based company with 20 employees, good safety standards and no claims history, etc.  The price quotations for these profiles would be tracked over time to estimate the overall change in premiums.  </p>  <p>  By way of update to the Deputy, this further examination is currently under way, and it is expected that the CSO will provide the CIWG with a final determination on feasibility during the summer months of this year.  On the basis that it will be the CSO that makes proposals to the CIWG, regarding the feasibility of this potential approach, I will await the completion of this work, and the views of the CIWG following from that, prior to making a decision on the introduction of such an index.</p></reply>

The charge is applied to an account regardless of the number of credit cards issued to the account.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that individuals are exempt from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) on their interest income where they, or their spouse or civil partner, are aged 65 or over and their total income in a year (including the deposit interest) is below the annual exemption limit.  For 2019 the exemption limits are &euro;18,000 for a single individual and &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners. </p>  <p>  The DIRT exemption does not automatically apply but must be claimed by making a declaration (on form DE1) to the financial institution where the account is held.

In the absence of this declaration, a financial institution is obliged to deduct DIRT.  However, in any case where DIRT is deducted from the interest income of an individual who would have qualified for the exemption, he or she is entitled to claim a refund of that tax.</p></reply>

The State Pension (contributory), on the other hand, has regard to each person&rsquo;s social insurance record, which may include periods in insurable employment, voluntary contributions and credited contributions. </p>  <p>  Any attempt to insert home credits into public service occupational pension schemes would run counter to fundamental principles underpinning those schemes and would represent a very substantial cost to the State.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that members of most pre-2013 public service pension schemes, including those of State bodies and bodies such as the Central Bank, will have the option to purchase notional pensionable service at full cost to themselves and subject to the normal purchase scheme limits, including compliance with Revenue limits in relation to the obtaining of tax relief on their purchase contributions, and so may compensate in this way for taking time out of work for home caring.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which is the career average defined benefit pension scheme applicable to most new entrant public servants from January 2013, arrangements to facilitate the purchase of Single Scheme benefits additional to the benefits accrued based on pensionable remuneration earned by the Scheme member, are currently being finalised.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p>  <p>  I made special interim arrangements for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements, clearly conveyed to all concerned, permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that special arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the Oireachtas and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform websites.</p>  <p>  Whenever legislation is enacted to implement a change in policy, there has to be a dividing line between those who are affected by the change and those who are not.  There are always people who will not benefit because they miss the deadline by a matter of days or weeks.  Having considered all of the issues in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, as set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms, whether by legislative change or otherwise.</p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. </p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Schools are advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal can be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Additional special education teaching allocations will be made for schools who have increased enrolments to the extent that they achieve developing status, once school enrolments have been verified at October 2019, as opposed to being based on projected enrolments. As the actual enrolments must be taken account of, this process cannot take place until the new school year is underway.</p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>As revised updated allocations have recently been issued to schools, this process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.</p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. </p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. </p><p>The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will commence later in 2019. The patronage process for the remainder of the new schools will also be run at a later date, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website (<i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>) and the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie  ). </p><p>It is intended that the permanent school building will be developed on the zoned school site within the  Local Infastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) residential development at Corballis, Donabate. </p><p>The school will be delivered under the Department's Design &amp;amp; Build Programme.

In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment. The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>1. Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>2. Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>3. Make work pay (the Make Work Pay Report was launched in April 2016  with many of its recommendations already being implemented);</p><p>4. Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>5. Provide coordinated and seamless support; and</p><p>6. Engage employers.</p><p>Implementation of the Strategy is monitored by a working group under the direction of an independent chairperson (Mr Fergus Finlay). This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy, and with the assistance of representatives and stakeholders from the disability sector, ensures that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets. </p><p>I can also advise that my officials, in cooperation with the National Disability Authority, and in consultation with the Strategy implementation group, are finalising a second three year action plan under the Strategy to ensure that the progress of implementation continues.</p></reply>

In order to allow full consideration of these issues, and so that the publication of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill would not be delayed, it was decided that the best option would be to provide for safe access to health services in a separate companion piece of legislation in 2019. </p>  <p>  Government approval for this approach was received in September 2018.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working with the Office of the Attorney General on this legislation with a view to having a General Scheme drafted by the summer.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  The Minister for Health has no role or powers in relation to such matters.</p>  <p>  Following detailed consideration of an application for the reimbursement of Spinraza and lengthy engagement with the company, the HSE recently decided that it was unable to reimburse Spinraza. The HSE concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness was still quite limited and that the price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  On the 21 February the HSE wrote to the company informing them of the HSE&rsquo;s proposal to refuse reimbursement of Spinraza at the current price offering. Under the terms of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 the company had 28 days to come back to the HSE with a new proposal.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the manufacturer, Biogen has been in contact with the HSE and has notified them that it intends to submit full and final representations, which will be carefully considered by the HSE.</p>  <p>  To facilitate Biogen&rsquo;s request, the period for representations was temporarily extended to enable the company to submit their representations.

This represents an increase in activity of 12% against 2017 and an increase in activity of 87% compared to 2016 when 224 procedures were carried out.</p>  <p>  CHI advise that as of the 29th March 2019 there were 174 patients on the Total Spinal Waiting List (including suspensions).  This is a reduction of 26% (61 patients) since the same period last year when there were 235 patients on the Total Spinal Waiting List. Furthermore, the number of patients suspended has decreased by 77% in the same period, down from 64 at the end of March 2018 to 15 at the end of March 2019.</p>  <p>  CHI is currently recruiting two additional general orthopaedic consultants which will further reduce waiting times for children for an orthopaedic outpatient appointment.  More broadly, all patient referrals to the orthopaedic spinal service at CHI are reviewed and clinically prioritised by a consultant.  These patients are seen in order of clinical priority. Most patients are seen within 12 months.</p>  <p>  An additional 800 Outpatient appointments were given to patients in CHI at Crumlin in 2018 compared to 2017, which led to a 31% reduction in the overall orthopaedic outpatient waiting list.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working closely with CHI with the aim of supporting the further development of a sustainable scoliosis service and ensuring that the on-going demand for services is met.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific breakdown of the waiting list requested by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Research carried out by the ESRI, as part of the ESRI Research Programme in Healthcare Reform funded by the Department of Health, examined the potential cost implications of proposed changes to oral healthcare provision, and informed the new Policy.  </p>  <p>  The indicative estimate of the cost of providing the oral healthcare packages outlined in the Policy to children aged under 16 is approximately &euro;33-&euro;34 million, of which &euro;10-12 million pertains to children aged under 6. This indicative estimate is  based on current fees payable by the HSE under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) and an estimated take-up rate based on previous research. The final cost will be subject to further discussion with dentists. </p>  <p>  Medical card holders currently receive dental services under the DTSS.  The indicative cost for provision of  the new packages of care for all adults ranges from &euro;23-48 million.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte will prioritise vulnerable adults, including those in residential care, to access dental care. The cost of providing services for those in residential care will be informed by the planned assessment of oral healthcare need for high support care among that group of vulnerable adults. This assessment of need is one of the priority actions of the Policy.</p>  <p>  In 2020 the introduction of packages of care for children under 6 years of age will be prioritised. In addition, there will be a focus on enabling vulnerable adults to access their local dentist as a first point of contact and ensuring that they are referred to the HSE community oral healthcare service or other appropriate service, if required.</p></reply>

I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the actual levels of exports will depend on a range of factors, including global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements.  </p>  <p>   A veterinary health certificate for the export of beef from Ireland to Iran was agreed in March 2013.  DAFM officials participated in a successful trade mission to Iran and Turkey in April 2016.  While the trade mission was primarily dairy-focused, DAFM officials had the opportunity to meet with their Iranian counterparts in order to progress and ultimately agree sheepmeat access to the Iranian market and also to explore other common areas of interest.  </p>  <p>  Limited exports to Iran can be explained by a combination of unfavourable trading conditions, cheaper supplies of beef from Brazil to the Iranian market, and financial barriers.  Work is on-going within the EU to devise measures to overcome financial barriers to trade between the EU and Iran.</p></reply>

The Scheme opened for applications on 28th March 2018 and it will remain open until 31st March 2020. </p>  <p>  At 29th March, there were 553 eligibility applications received, of which 497 are approved and 11 are ineligible. The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 99 to a value of &euro;21.6m, 20 of which relate to food businesses with a total value of &euro;6.4m.  While the number of loans progressed to sanction level is relatively low, it reflects the current uncertainty regarding the outcome of Brexit. However, the number of eligibility applications approved indicates a good level of interest in the Scheme and is a good indicator of businesses engaging in Brexit preparedness. It was not possible to include primary agriculture because of the guarantee arrangements for the Scheme, which includes the EU/EIF InnovFin Programme.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to launch the "Future Growth Loan Scheme" last week.  It has been developed by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agrifood &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p>  <p>  As I said in the announcement last week, this is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  I have had ongoing engagement with the banks with regard to access to finance needs in the agrifood sector.  I am pleased to see that this engagement and the delivery of the 2017 &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; has acted as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve existing offerings and to develop new products for the sector which serve its working capital needs. A Spending Review of the Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme, published in Budget 2019, concluded that this was one of its main impacts.</p>  <p>   In this context, the focus of the Government has been to address market gaps, the most critical of which has been identified as unsecured longer-term investment finance and this will now be addressed through the Future Growth Loan Scheme.</p></reply>

There will be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in Council Regulations.  </p>  <p>  The proposals outline significant changes to the direct payments system including:-</p>  <p>  - Replacing the current Basic Payment Scheme with the Basic Income Support for Sustainability (BISS) payment;</p>  <p>  - The capping of direct payments &ndash; this involves a graduated reduction of payments over &euro;60,000 per annum.  A 100% reduction is to be applied to the amount of the payment exceeding &euro;100,000, at least 75% to payments between &euro;90,000 and &euro;100,000, at least 50% to payments between &euro;75,000 and &euro;90,000, and at least 25% to payments between &euro;60,000 and &euro;75,000.  Member States will be required to subtract the salaries of the farmer including taxes and social contributions, before applying capping.  The cost of regular and unpaid labour should also be taken into account.  </p>  <p>  - The Complementary Redistribution of Income Support for Sustainability (CRISS) - the funding released from capping is to be used for the mandatory redistributive income support i.e. moving support from large to small/medium farms.  This is a mandatory requirement for Member States.  Redistribution is not limited to the funding released by capping and it will be up to the Member State to set out what funding it intends to use and to who the additional funds will be made available.  </p>  <p>  - A complementary income support for Young Farmers (CISYF) which can be funded through surplus funds from capping.  The CISYF is a top-up scheme for young farmers and is optional for Member States.  However, in overall terms, at least 2% of all funding must be spent on young farmers either by the top-up mechanism or through a lump sum of up to &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  - The introduction of Eco-schemes for the environment under Pillar I.  This is a new requirement under the CAP legislative proposals.  Member States are obliged to offer at least one eco- scheme, which would be optional for farmers.  The eco-scheme can be applied for on an annual basis.  Member States must draft a list of practices that are beneficial for agriculture and the environment.  Payments are only provided in cases where the beneficiary goes beyond certain conditions and requirements.</p>  <p>  - Continued convergence, where beneficiaries of direct payments must receive 75% of the average planned unit amount by 2026.</p>  <p>  - Optional lump sum for small farmers.</p>  <p>  - Coupled support continues and is available for more sectors including non-food fuel replacement.  The available funding proposed for coupled support is reduced to 10% or 12% if this includes protein crops.</p>  <p>  My Department is a strong proponent of evidence-based policy making, and I can confirm that work is currently underway to analyse the impact of the various elements of direct payments in the draft regulations. Preliminary modelling exercises have been carried out and the results of these analyses are currently being reviewed and revised to take account of the most recently available data.</p>  <p>  These direct payment measures (BISS, CRISS, CISYF and Eco-Schemes) are inextricably linked to each other. This means that each time one of the elements is changed, each of the other elements also must change. As a result, any analysis only remains current until one of the elements changes. This is likely to continue until the regulations are fully developed, at which time detailed analyses will be completed to fully address the impact on farmers in Ireland of CAP 2020. This methodology is congruent with the requirement for each Member State to prepare a Strategic Plan addressing all aspects of CAP expenditure and, consequently, all of these analyses remain at a drafting stage until the Regulations are resolved.</p></reply>

They are free to trade until that date but, on that date, they are trade restricted until they complete a clear TB test. This is consistent with existing TB Eradication policy. </p>  <p>  High Risk herds have to undergo 3 herd tests post-derestriction.  The first test may take place at a time of the farmer&rsquo;s choosing between 3 - 8 months after derestriction.  Herds are trade restricted when the scheduled date of the post-de-restriction test is reached (3 months), i.e. they may acquire cattle but may not dispatch cattle (other than calves under 6 weeks of age) except directly to slaughter from that date. After the post-derestriction test is completed, if clear, the herd must complete 2 more tests at 6 monthly intervals. </p>  <p>  The scientific justification for selecting these herds for enhanced treatment resides in the fact that the herd incidence, on the post-derestriction test is approx. four times greater for these herds than that for the Round test.  In addition, the number of reactors per thousand animals tested (the APT) for these herds is almost 3 times greater than that for the Round test. </p>  <p>  Department officials have met with the herd owner regarding the current situation with the herd. </p></reply>

The position is unchanged.  </p><p>[Ref No.: 15328/19]*  To ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment if he will address a matter in relation to the nationwide ban on fossil fuels (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. - Michael Healy-Rae.</p><p>I have grave reservations about any proposal for a nationwide ban on fossil fuels. It is obvious in built up areas that smoky fuels are not welcome, but in the countryside there is no reason in the world why fossil fuels cannot continue to be burned. Recent mixed messages are being sent out by the Government and many of the suppliers of solid fuels are having real trouble with regard to stocks and knowing what the market is going to be for the future. Clarity is needed around this whole issue and the Government&rsquo;s intention is needed to be made clearer for the general public also.</p><p>*For WRITTEN answer on Tuesday, 2nd April, 2019.</p><p>(1009  Received on 27th March, 2019.)</p><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p><p>In light of its significant health and environmental benefits, it had been announced by a number of previous Ministers that the ban would be extended to the entire territory of the State. However, as the Deputy may be aware from recent press reports, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would legally challenge this decision. </p><p>I have discussed this issue with the Attorney General, my Department is now working to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air.</p><p>However, pending the completion of this work I am aware of the need to provide clarity now to the public and to the trade to enable them adequately plan for purchases of stock for the 2019/20 heating season. I can confirm therefore that the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019/20 heating season.</p></reply>

Purchasing cheap low quality wood as a home heating fuel may prove to be a false economy as much of the energy is needed to burn off excess moisture in the wood rather than providing heat output to the consumer. The resulting reduced combustion temperature can, therefore, result in the increased generation and release of toxic and carcinogenic air pollutants including Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dioxins which are promoted by the high chlorine levels in the fuel. While there are no statutory regulations for biomass quality, a voluntary Wood Fuel Quality Assurance scheme is in place. </p>  <p>  In relation to air pollution more generally, recent scientific evidence indicates that it is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood. With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy. The Strategy, which I intend to publish this year, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives. Domestic solid fuel use will be addressed in the context of the strategy.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.4 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  The aim of the NBP is to provide every premises with access to a high speed broadband service on a future proofed basis. While the NBP sets the minimum download speed at 30 megabits per second, the NBP recognises that higher speeds and quality of service are likely to be required as the digital society develops and progresses. This is supported by data from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) whose Quarter 4 2018 Key Data report noted that subscriptions to a fibre service stood at 90,500, a 128% increase when compared with the same period the previous year. The increase in subscriptions is considered to be likely as a result of the recent network build of fibre across the country by the telecoms sector, with further fibre investments announced.</p>  <p>  There can be a range of reasons why businesses may choose not to switch to a fibre broadband service at the point of it becoming available, including, for example, the length of time remaining on their current contract. The choices that businesses or hotels make at a point in time in relation to the selection of a broadband retail service, is very much a matter for individual consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted. </p><p>Overage Exemptions currently provided by the Department are governed by three guiding principles as follows:</p><p>&middot; A Letter of Recommendation supplied from a specialist (NB: Not a GP/Public Health Nurse)</p><p>&middot; The child not reaching 6 years of age during the exemption year to comply with the school starting age (as per Educational Welfare Act, 2000)</p><p>&middot; ECCE Allocation taken -i.e. if a child has already availed of the full two years they will not be eligible.  </p><p>In  the case of the child named, the application was declined on the basis that their ECCE entitlement will have been utilised in full by the end of June.</p><p>It is important to note that<s></s>this provision of an overage exemption by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education before the age of 6 years which is the statutory requirement or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. </p><p>It should also be noted that the application process for an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme was introduced within a context where: </p><p>&middot; The ECCE programme was for one year only; and</p><p>&middot; The Access and Inclusions Model (AIM) did not exist. </p><p>Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016/2017, the further extension of the programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, the rationale underpinning the policy intent of the system of overage exemption came under review as the initial premise for the provision of an exemption might have been considered to be no longer valid, i.e. an overage exemption as originally designed allowed for a child to avail of one programme year of ECCE over two years, whereas the standard provision is now a full two programme years.  </p><p>Therefore, the overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and report by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from the Department  are now considering policy options following on from the recent publication of this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child. </p><p>The current system will continue until such time as any new policy proposals are in place. </p><p>A key finding of the NDA report, which was  published recently, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.</p><p>The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). </p><p>My Department will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019.

I have just received a third interim report from Ms. Reynolds dated 1 April informing me that this will now be delayed to end May.  I understand that the reason for the delay is that the fieldwork being carried out by both Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which is now reaching a conclusion, is complex, forensic and resource intensive, and has taken longer than anticipated. </p>  <p>  The two previous interim reports from the Reviewer have been published on my Department's website.  The purpose of this review, which I initiated following the discovery of cases of illegal registrations in the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild records, is to determine if similar evidence of illegal birth registrations can be identified from the records of other former adoption agencies and other relevant bodies.</p>  <p>  The final report and its findings will provide information to assist me in identifying any necessary next steps.</p></reply>

In addition to this, each child placed out of state has a care order in place in Ireland and as such consent must also be provided by the District Court and in some instances the High Court, depending on the nature of the care order. </p>  <p>  Out of State placements, in keeping with placements made within the State, are supervised by allocated social workers and the local management of social work team leaders and Principal Social Workers.  National oversight of these placements is maintained through a reporting and tracking system in place in the office of the Chief Operations Officer. Tusla Social Workers supervising out of state placements visit at intervals agreed and set out in the child's care plan.  Frequency of social work visits range from once every two weeks for some children to once every twelve weeks for children in more settled placements. In some cases, support is also provided by local social services in the country where the child is placed, which may involve placement visits. </p>  <p>  The frequency of family contact is determined through the care planning process for each child, taking into account the views of the child, their family, their carers, other professionals involved and Guardians Ad Litem. Family access with the child in an out of state placement is supported by Tusla and this includes booking and paying for flights. The majority of children in out of state placements have regular family contact, including face to face meetings, trips back to Ireland and contact by telephone or through social media. In a very small number of cases there may be no family contact, which can arise as a result of the wishes of the child and/or a social work decision relating to child protection risks. </p></reply>

The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision. There has been some improvement for the first three months of 2019 with an oral hearing decision taking on average 28 weeks and a summary decision taking 23.8 weeks.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p>  <p>  Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  </p>  <p>  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, CE sponsors can advertise their vacancies free of charge on the Department's JobsIreland website, <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i>.  The process of posting vacancies is relatively straightforward and a tailored video is available online to assist sponsors.  </p><p>A number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE was introduced in 2017.  The main purpose of these changes was to broaden the availability to a greater number of people on the Live Register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on a programme. </p><p>The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  Participants between 21 and 55 years on CE are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  Since 1st June 2018, I am also facilitating persons to take up a placement on CE while also attending their JobPath provider.  The overall limit of participation on CE is 6 years from 1st January 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment). </p><p>Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria.  </p><p>While participation on CE is a stepping stone back to employment, these positions are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Nevertheless, I am fully committed to the future of community employment schemes , and I want to see them sustained.  </p><p>The Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements, in particular in respect of CE schemes whose primary focus is social inclusion and the delivery of social services.  The first meeting of the IDG was held last week and it is expected that the Group will report to Cabinet by end of Q2 2019.</p><p>Any CE sponsor organisation who has recruitment concerns should contact their nearest Intreo Centre who will provide assistance.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Decisions on whether to grant planning permission for a quarry is a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the case may be, having regard to the particular local circumstances of the proposed development and potential impacts on the local environment, landscape, water sources, nature etc.  When granting planning permission for a quarry, it is open to the local planning authority or An Bord Pleanala to attach appropriate conditions to such permissions on a case by case basis. Such conditions may relate to the implementation of environmental mitigation measures; times of operation; control of noise, blasting, dust, water pollution and waste; environmental monitoring; special contributions; extraction limits and site restoration.  </p>  <p>  In this connection, it should be noted that a person is not entitled solely by reasons of a planning permission to carry out development and that other specific requirements relating to the quarrying sector may apply, such as under the Health and Safety code - e.g. Guidance from the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Quarries) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 28 of 2008) - which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

The burning which the Deputy refers to in his question which occurred last weekend in Killarney National Park took place a month after the burning season had ended and was illegal and it caused significant damage to Park. I absolutely reject the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that this burning was somehow linked to my sensible, correct and responsible decision not to extend that burning season.</p></reply>
