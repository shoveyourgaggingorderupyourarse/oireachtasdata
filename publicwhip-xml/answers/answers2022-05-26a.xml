This will be a platform for the much-needed change on how we will provide care to women in Ireland.</p><p>There are infrastructural challenges with facilities at Holles St. It&rsquo;s not in keeping with our National Maternity Strategy. I want to thank and acknowledge all the wonderful staff at the NMH who are providing excellent quality and safe services for women and infants.</p><p>Minor capital funding continues to be provided to assist with ongoing repairs and maintenance of the hospital. We continue to improve and expand existing services at the NMH. We are also introducing new services, including investment in staffing to progress the Maternity Strategy: </p><p>- a &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; gynaecology clinic, </p><p>- regional fertility hub for the Ireland East Hospital Group</p><p>- establishment of the first specialist menopause clinic, last year, and</p><p>- national foetal MRI service. </p><p>I recently opened an extension to the Labour and Birthing Suite. Women attending will receive the benefit of these upgraded facilities which now include:</p><p>- 12-ensuite rooms</p><p>- Hydrotherapy pool, </p><p>- Specialised room for immunocompromised patients, and</p><p>- Dedicated bereavement suite.</p><p>I understand that NMH and HSE are engaging regarding additional areas for potential investment until relocation to Elm Park is complete. But the scale of those works must be balanced as larger interventions could reduce clinical capacity in the interim.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s first Strategic Investment Framework, a survey of all healthcare infrastructure is underway. This will assist in the empirical prioritisation of future investment. </p><p>However, the long-term future of NMH is not at Holles Street. I am committed to ensuring the new NMH is supported as centre of excellence for maternity care. This will ensure that women are treated with dignity and respect in an appropriate physical environment.</p></reply>

Children in special schools are supported by the Teams in the school, home and community environment.</p><p>The services provided are subject to available staffing resources and the HSE has advised that there are ongoing recruitment and retention challenges regarding the filling of therapy posts. In that regard, the average vacancy rate in the Network Teams for Mayo is approximately 27%. Since 2019, approximately 475 development posts have been funded by the Government and allocated to children&rsquo;s disability services across the country. </p><p>The HSE continues to explore a range of options to support the recruitment of essential staff to strengthen the capacity of Network Teams, in order to reduce the waiting times for children to access therapy supports.</p><p>A CDNT Staff Census and Workforce Review recently finalised by the HSE will provide valuable information to allow targeted workforce planning by Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Managers to reinforce the skill mix of their teams to accommodate local population need.</p></reply>

This aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged and ensure greater capacity in the future. It will also help to address waiting lists on a national level through the provision of dedicated, standalone facilities in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  As agreed by Government, the elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases. The first phase will commence with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients. The provision of in-patient treatment will be considered in a subsequent phase. The need for this future in-patient care will be factored into the detailed planning and design phase of the elective facilities.   </p>  <p>  The development of the elective hospital proposals is following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code. This sets out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects. A programme Business Case has been reviewed by my Department. It has been shared with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A project-level Business Case for Cork is almost complete. This is expected to be submitted through the required Public Spending Code&rsquo;s External Assurance Process in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Therapists play a crucial role in service delivery, often to the most vulnerable in society. Ensuring that therapists who have qualified outside the State can practise is a priority for me, and the Government. Consequently, this year I increased CORU&rsquo;s funding to &euro;5m, a rise of 60% on 2017&rsquo;s. CORU has subsequently introduced enhanced registration processes and additional technology, which I expect will improve efficiencies. </p>  <p>  During the period 2019 &ndash; 22, CORU received 23 applications for recognition of qualifications from speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists who qualified in Northern Ireland. The average processing period is currently 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  CORU&rsquo;s overarching objective is to protect the public. Applications for recognition of professional qualifications are assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the legislation. In the interest of equal treatment, the same assessment process and timelines apply to all applicants, regardless of the country of qualification.</p>  <p>  I met with both the chairperson and the CEO of CORU in March 2021 and emphasised the need for an efficient and effective process. My officials meet with CORU on a monthly basis to discuss, amongst other things, further improvements to the registration processes. </p>  <p>  I expect that this ongoing engagement with CORU and increased resources will result in further efficiencies.</p></reply>

I agree with him that the World Health Organisation plays a vital role in public health and that we need to address any confusion here. </p><p>Let me be clear, what is being looked at is an international agreement or instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The aim of such an instrument is to protect public health and to help save lives in the event of future pandemics. </p><p>We need a multilateral approach to global health issues with the WHO at its core. COVID-19 has highlighted shortcomings in global pandemic preparedness and response. </p><p>There have been baseless claims that Ireland is somehow signing away its sovereignty and passing over powers, and this is simply not the case. We know from COVID-19 that clear communications is central to addressing false and misleading claims.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body established for these negotiations met for the first time on 24th February; we are still at the start of this process. A progress report is due at the World Health Assembly in May 2023, with the aim of adopting the instrument by 2024.</p><p>In line with the Constitution, Government approval must be sought for the signature, ratification or approval of any international agreement. </p></reply>

This was in response to the introduction of HIQA&rsquo;s National Residential Care Standards for Older People. </p><p>This programme includes 90 different projects at various stages. 33 projects are complete as at the end of 2021. A further 11 are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.</p><p>7 CNUs are included in a single bundle to be developed by Public Private Partnership (PPP). Midleton Community Nursing Unit is included in this bundle. </p><p>The PPP procurement process is in progress. It is anticipated that the construction of the new CNU in Midleton will commence by Quarter 4, 2022 and will be completed in 2024. Upon completion the project will provide 50 replacement beds.  </p><p>The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process, subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.</p></reply>

The final decision to proceed with this project will be made in line with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I asked the HSE, Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI), as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from CHI at Temple Street, CHI at Crumlin and Cappagh to develop a dedicated plan to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures, specifically scoliosis and spina bifida, by year end. More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh to undertake non-complex surgery for paediatric patients aged 2 years and over. This builds on &euro;1.65 allocation to Cappagh under the Access to Care Programme. </p></reply>

Since autumn 2021, the Community Health Organisation in Galway has sought to re-open publicly funded respite beds in line with post-pandemic requirements to meet Infection, Prevention and Control measures.</p>  <p>  The current number of operational respite beds in Co. Galway is 10, 7 of which are in Merlin Park Community Nursing Unit. </p>  <p>  A number of respite beds in Merlin Park which were operational pre-Covid-19 were closed temporarily for remedial works to ensure HIQA compliance. The HSE confirmed that remedial works are complete and envision that the 13 respite beds will be operational by August 2022.  </p>  <p>  Currently, there are several measures being used to mitigate against a reduction in respite services in Galway. Emergency respite protocol is in operation linking with families to provide emergency respite through in-home supports or placement in nursing homes. Day services continue to reopen across Galway assisting families in caring for their family members at home. Western Alzheimer&rsquo;s also have 12 respite beds available to clients. </p>  <p>  Increasing respite provision in Galway is essential to provide older people with the range of services they require. I want to assure you that the continued provision of increased respite services in Galway is a priority and I have requested that the HSE keep me updated on any further developments.</p></reply>

With this funding they are projected to remove 273,000 patients from acute hospital waiting lists.

Currently there are 1,096 dental contractors with the HSE. This compares with 1,151 contract holders at the end of 2021 and 1,354 at the end of 2020. These figures do not include dentists who are employed by contracted dentists who may also contribute to service provision.</p>  <p>  In order to compare the number of dentists providing care in the DTSS over time, figures on the number of contractors submitting claims are a more useful measure.

The State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. It is acknowledged that certain rural GMS vacancies can be difficult to fill; at the start of this month there were 35 GMS GP vacancies, 19 of which were in rural areas. For this reason, in addition to the more general measures taken to increase the number of GPs in the State and the significant increases in investment into general practice, specific supports are in place to support GPs in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023, with expenditure increased by &euro;206 million already as of this year. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was introduced previously to support rural GPs, these supports have been increased by 10% under the 2019 GP Agreement. In addition, practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking. Specific fees are also in place for dispensing doctors (who operate in rural areas), these have been increased by 28% under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. Following the transfer of responsibility for GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners last year, 258 places are planned for this year and even further increases planned for the coming years.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. </p>  <p>  These are defined processes in which all Departments and agencies are subject to and must follow to ensure that Government, as the approving authority for all major projects, can be satisfied that the project is the best means to achieve a policy goal and that we achieve maximum value for money for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the Galway University Hospital Emergency Department (ED), I am pleased to say that the interim emergency department, including additional resuscitation spaces, support accommodation and improved infection prevention and control measures, is currently under construction using a rapid build solution. The critical services are expected to be completed by end of June 2022.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the larger scale proposals for the ED, originally the proposal was for a new multi-story ED block, but now, driven by local requirements and the need to build more efficiently on a constricted site, we will shortly be receiving proposals costed in the hundreds of millions.</p>  <p>  I understand that the drafting by the HSE of the Strategic Assessment Report, to ensure full compliance with PSC requirements for the more substantial proposals, is well advanced. It is now expected to be submitted to  my Department by early Q3 2022.</p>  <p>  If granted approval-in principle, the preliminary business case can then be updated by the HSE and be brought forward for review to progress those proposals.</p>  <p>  I have referred the questions relating to the average number of persons who have been left sitting overnight in chairs since the beginning of 2021, in the present facility while awaiting a bed in the hospital to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented next year, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with an intake of 258 planned for this year. In addition, changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  Work on the review has commenced this year.  The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice, and will set out measures necessary to deliver a sustainable service into the future.</p></reply>

Their drive and dedication have been key components in our managing of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the MLSA&rsquo;s claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists. As you may be aware, the current public pay agreement, Building Momentum 2021-2022, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims such as this one. The MLSA were granted their own bargaining unit to progress this claim. The size of the Sectoral Bargaining fund available to the MLSA, and to all other cohorts of staff bound by this Agreement, equates to 1% of their basic pay. The MLSA and Health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance their claim for pay parity through the Sectoral Bargaining process.</p>  <p>The Public Service Agreement Group (PSAG), comprised of union and civil service representatives with an independent chair, met on May 11th to consider this matter. They recommended that the matter be immediately referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained in the meantime.</p>  <p>  While the MLSA agreed to engage at the WRC, they have not agreed to lift their strike action which is a breach of Building Momentum.  This engagement between the parties took place on May 17th 2022 but, unfortunately, no resolution was reached.</p>  <p>  In order to mitigate the disruption caused by the strike, the HSE began cancelling inpatient and day-case elective procedures and hospital outpatient appointments, all to be rescheduled for as soon as possible. Derogations were granted to allow the continuation of dialysis and some cancer services. The HSE will continue to liaise with the MLSA on contingency plans and derogations for days that strike action has been announced.  However, there will be an inevitable impact on testing services.</p>  <p>  While the Department of Health is disappointed that industrial action has been initiated by the MLSA, and that disruptions have been caused across the health service, Health Management remain keen to engage with the MLSA. </p>  <p>  In relation to the query on recruitment and retention for this group of staff  I am advised the HSE plans to undertake a national recruitment campaign to promote the role of Medical Scientists both nationally and internationally.</p></reply>

The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS. </p><p>I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. </p><p>To address the concerns of contractors about the viability of the Scheme, I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. </p><p>The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million. </p><p>Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1<sup>st</sup>May. </p><p>The changes to the Scheme, are interim measures designed to secure services for medical card holders pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy. Work on that longer-term project has already commenced and it is estimated it will take 1-2 years to complete. </p><p>The HSE will assist anyone who is still experiencing problems accessing a service. </p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p><p>A technical group within the HSE's Community Audiology Service (CAS) defines the minimum specifications to ensure that medical card holders who need them have access to high quality digital hearing aids. The CAS also undertakes a formal HSE procurement process on a regular basis to ensure public money spent on hearing aids is effectively and efficiently utilised.  The Treatment Benefit Scheme, provided by the Department of Social Protection, is available to those who have paid sufficient PRSI contributions. This scheme provides a maximum funding of &euro;500 for each hearing aid and &euro;100 towards the cost of repairs. Suppliers must be registered with the Department of Social Protection. A person may choose to purchase a more expensive hearing aid and would pay any additional costs arising. </p><p>Individuals who do not possess a medical card or who are not eligible for the Treatment Benefit Scheme would have to purchase hearing aids privately from a commercial provider. If the individual has private health insurance, it may cover hearing aid costs. Hearing aids are exempt from VAT and people may also be entitled to claim tax relief at the standard rate of tax (20%) on their purchase of hearing aids where prescribed by a practitioner.</p></reply>

The current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining to address outstanding claims. Under Building Momentum, sectoral bargaining is the sole mechanism through which the MLSA can advance their claim for pay parity. </p><p>The MLSA and Health management have been engaged in talks for many months to find a way to advance the claim through Sectoral Bargaining, however, the cost of their claim is substantially more than the bargaining fund available. Funding is available to partially resolve the claim within the current Agreement, but not to fully resolve it.</p><p>The issue was referred to the Public Service Agreement Group, and on May 11<sup>th</sup>, the body recommended that the matter be referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained.</p><p>While the MLSA agreed to engage at the WRC on May 17th, they did not lift their industrial action, in breach of the Building Momentum peace clause, and resulting in significant, and regrettable, disruption on the health service.</p><p>In order to mitigate the disruption caused by the strike, the HSE began cancelling inpatient and day-case elective procedures and hospital outpatient appointments, all to be rescheduled for as soon as possible. For example, in the Saolta group alone, over 400 procedures were cancelled last Wednesday across a range of specialties including medicine, general surgical procedures, endoscopy, orthopaedics, bronchoscopy, interventional radiology and others. Derogations were granted to allow the continuation of dialysis and some cancer services. At this point, the HSE has not had time to review fully the impact on patients and services of the stoppage on the 18th of May.</p><p>Health management remain open to engaging with the MLSA and will make every effort to ensure that a resolution is found as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Plan details how we intend to ensure that an even higher number, 1.7 million, are treated and removed from waiting lists. Therefore, if this Plan is fully delivered, it will reduce waiting lists by 18 percent this year which will bring the number of people waiting to 588,000, the lowest number in five years.  </p>  <p>  The Plan also dedicates &euro;15 million to three priority areas of paediatric orthopaedics, gynaecology and bariatrics / obesity, and aims to make significant changes to waiting lists in these areas. </p>  <p>  There is also particular focus on 15 high-volume inpatient day case procedures, so that every person waiting for over 6 months who is clinically ready will receive an offer of treatment. These procedures include cataracts, hip and knee replacements, and angiograms. </p>  <p>  At the same time, reforming and investing in our public health service will eradicate the gap between demand and capacity by addressing long-term reforms like improving patient pathways of care, enhancing data collection and information sharing, and revising waiting-list management protocols.</p>  <p>  A Waiting List Task Force has been established and is meeting fortnightly to track Plan progress and identify solutions to any blockages.

These include: </p> <blockquote> 	-  The new Outpatients Department at Ennis Hospital opened on Monday, March 29th 2021. The new OPD in Ennis has 15 clinical rooms, in addition to a phlebotomy bay, four waiting areas, offices and staff changing rooms. <br /><br />-  The new Outpatients Department at Nenagh Hospital opened recently, allowing the enhancement of facilities for outpatients in Nenagh in the long term. The development includes a dedicated Ophthalmology Injection Suite. <br /><br />-  ULHG has also engaged with the HSE's National Women and Infants Health Programme to establish ambulatory gynaecological and fertility services in Nenagh. The ambulatory gynaecology clinic and the regional fertility hub became operational in 2022.  The ambulatory gynaecology service is expected to significantly reduce the number of patients waiting for gynaecology appointments across the Group.<br /><br />-  ULHG recently opened newly developed inpatient accommodation at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. &lsquo;The Maigue Unit&rsquo;, is a modern, state-of-the-art 24 single room ward complex, and includes a new operating theatre suite. <br /><br />-  In total, 98 new beds were added to UHL by the end of 2020. A suite of 24 single rooms were completed on the UHL site and there is a dedicated Haematology Oncology Unit. A separate temporary 14-bed single room block has also been completed. <br /><br />-  The new Injury Unity in Ennis Hospital was handed over to the HSE on the 15th December 2021. The doors of the new &euro;2m Injury Unit at Ennis Hospital opened on Friday April 8th, bringing an immediate improvement in the clinical environment and experience for healthcare staff and the thousands of patients who use this service every year.. <br /><br />-  The development of the new four-storey, 96 single bed acute inpatient ward block extension at University Hospital Limerick has full planning permission, fire certification and is fully designed.  It is anticipated that the works contract will be awarded in early Quarter 2 2022 subject to HSE Board approval and funding availability. </blockquote>  <p>My Department and I remain committed to improving services at University Limerick Hospital Group and ensuring patient-centred care for the people of the Mid-West. The Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure services, facilities and patient experience at ULHG continue to be developed into the future. As the UHLG are responsible for the management of capacity across the Group, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-26a.165.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052600067#WRC02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 83 together.</p>  <p>The Cross Party Sl&aacute;intecare Report in 2017 articulated a new vision for healthcare in Ireland, including the provision of elective only hospitals, providing protected capacity for elective care. The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and HSE has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  The provision of additional protected capacity for elective care is further confirmed by the Government Decision, in December 2021 and subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, on a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice.</p>  <p>  With respect to a specific proposal for an elective only hospital in the mid-west region, a submission was made to the HSE National Capital and Property Steering Committee in 2018 for the St John&rsquo;s 120 bed proposal, and the proposal was considered by the Committee at that time and has been on the agenda since. However, substantial queries on the submission were raised by the Committee. As the proposal does not align with the recently approved Government Policy for National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy, it is not in the approved project pipeline and has not been included in HSE Capital Plan. </p></reply>

By establishing the sequence of an individual&rsquo;s genetic material, it is possible to identify sequences or mutations, which are specific to that person. Not only can these sequences identify the cause or stage of a disease, they can identify the risk of future disease and also help predict the likely benefits or side effects of a particular medication. Genomics has the potential to reshape clinical practice and to fundamentally change the way we prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor illness, providing the opportunity to have more precise and tailored treatments for patients.</p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed to utilise genomic data. Currently, there are a number of relevant genomic initiatives being developed in both the clinical and research arenas, and by public and private enterprise. These initiatives need to be co-ordinated within a broader strategic approach to the use of genomic medicine in Ireland. It is for this reason that a National Genetics and Genomics Strategy needs to be developed.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently working with the HSE on the Steering Group tasked with the delivery a National Genetics and Genomic Strategy. The Strategy will help shape the future of genetics and genomics in Ireland. The Minister looks forward to introducing the Strategy once it is developed.</p></reply>

We estimate that over 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year. This Plan details how we intend to ensure that an even higher number, 1.7 million, are treated and removed from waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Much of our waiting list funding will be directed to public hospitals, where additional elective activity will take place. However, we will also make greater use of the private sector, so we can help patients to get faster access to care.</p>  <p>  While the Plan provides overall direction and actions to be implemented across all acute scheduled care waiting lists this year, it does not specify plans per hospital. However, the HSE have been working closely with all hospital groups to finalise care improvement plans which will support funding prioritisation to help reduce waiting list backlogs and identify and build sustainable capacity within the Irish Health Service.</p>  <p>  We will also progress work towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets, as set out in the HSE National Service Plan (of 18 months for OPD; 12 months for IPDC; and 12 months for GI scopes).  We had 75,000 patients on active inpatient and day case waiting lists at the end of 2021 and aim to have treated almost all those patients by the end of 2022.</p></reply>

Their drive and dedication have been key components in our managing of the pandemic.</p><p>I acknowledge the MLSA&rsquo;s claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists. As you may be aware, the current public pay agreement, Building Momentum 2021-2022, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims such as this one. </p><p>Department officials met with the HSE and the MLSA on 25 August, and again on 29 September 2020 in relation to their outstanding claim.  The parties met at the WRC on the 17th of November 2020, 14<sup>th</sup>April 2021 and 8<sup>th</sup>March 2022.</p><p>Sectoral Bargaining Meetings took place between Health Management and the MLSA on the following dates; 11<sup>th</sup>November 2021, 29<sup>th</sup>of November 2021, 6<sup>th</sup>December 2021, 14th of December 2021 and the 14th of January 2022. </p><p>Despite engagement between the MLSA, HSE and DoH officials since November 2021, it has not been possible to agree a route to partially resolve the longstanding claim due to insufficient funds being available through Sectoral Bargaining. This matter has been escalated through the dispute resolution mechanism under Building Momentum and considered twice by the Public Service Agreement Group (PSAG) on 31 March and 11 May. PSAG recommended that this matter be referred to the WRC for urgent engagement and that industrial peace be maintained. </p><p>While the MLSA agreed to engage at the WRC, they have not agreed to lift their strike action which is a breach of Building Momentum.  This engagement between the parties took place on May 17th 2022 but, unfortunately, no resolution was reached.</p><p>While the Department of Health is disappointed that industrial action has been initiated by the MLSA, and that disruptions have been caused across the health service, Health Management remain open to engagement with the MLSA.</p></reply>

Present at this meeting were representatives of suppliers of HRT, the HPRA, PSI, the HSE, clinical representatives from the National Women and Infants Health Programme, and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.</p>  <p>  Based on information provided by companies involved in the recent HRT shortages, we now appear to have entered a stabilisation period in supply. During this stabilisation period, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. Following my meeting with key stakeholders involved in the supply of HRT products to the Irish market it was agreed to establish a multi-stakeholder group to closely monitor the supply of HRT until the issue is fully resolved.</p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I also recognise that optometrists have also played an important role in the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. </p>  <p>  Optometrists have the potential to play a greater role, and my officials are working with their counterparts in the HSE with a view to contracting more services from acute and community settings out to community optometrists.</p>  <p>  The current contract with Optometrists dates back to 1999 and it is accepted that it is has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the recommendations from the 2017 Primary Care Eye Services Review Group Report, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that optometrists have by virtue of their education and training.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the development of community services which can facilitate expanded and more integrated provision of eye care in local communities. In this context, a contractual relationship between optometrists and the HSE which is modernised to emphasise a strengthened primary care system will be required.</p>  <p>  Any publicly funded service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.</p>  <p>  Subject to available resources, the 2022 priority for the HSE is to support the Primary Care Eye Teams in CHOs 6, 7 and 9 in rolling out a team model. In this context, multi-disciplinary staff, including optometrists, working within primary care eye teams will manage patients in order to reduce hospital waiting lists.</p></reply>

The rate of assessment for rental properties will be reduced from 80% to 40% for income from all principal residences. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. The Deputy may be aware that a 100% disregard of rental income was originally proposed, however I sought the compromised and final agreed position of 40%. This compromise I feel goes someway to addressing the concerns expressed by some people in relation to medical cards, along with concerns I held myself in relation to non-contributory pensions and indeed safeguarding of nursing home residents. Any additional disregard of rental income would compromise this position.</p>  <p>  This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8. It is expected that legislation will be brought forward in the coming months. The change will be made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage&rsquo;s Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022.</p></reply>

The current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining to address outstanding claims. Under Building Momentum, sectoral bargaining is the sole mechanism through which the MLSA can advance their claim for pay parity. </p><p>The MLSA and Health management have been engaged in talks for many months to find a way to advance the claim through Sectoral Bargaining, however, the cost of their claim is substantially more than the bargaining fund available. Funding is available to partially resolve the claim within the current Agreement, but not to fully resolve it.</p><p>The issue was referred to the Public Service Agreement Group, and on May 11<sup>th</sup>, the body recommended that the matter be referred to the WRC and that industrial peace be maintained.</p><p>While the MLSA agreed to engage at the WRC on May 17th, they did not lift their industrial action, in breach of the Building Momentum peace clause, and resulting in significant, and regrettable, disruption across the health service.</p><p>Health management remain open to engaging with the MLSA and will make every effort to ensure that a resolution is found as soon as possible.</p><p>While I acknowledge that staff shortages exist in the Medical Scientist profession, since 2019 there has been a 6% growth in the number ofmedical scientists. The HSE plans to undertake recruitment campaign  for Medical Scientists both nationally and internationally. Investment in development posts has been confirmed via the NSP 2022 and there are circa 160 development posts being recruited at this time in addition to replacement posts.</p></reply>

Separate to the legal framework, and as required under the Public Spending Code, the final business case for the capital project is progressing. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.</p>  <p>  A Final business case has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board and is now subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including the External Assurance Process for major capital projects recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted, the project can move to preparation of tender documents in line with EU law and deployment of a tendering strategy.</p>  <p>  The final decision to proceed with the construction of the NMH and therefore to estimate the cost for the new NMH cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal continues to deliver value for money and remains affordable.</p>  <p>  The new Children&rsquo;s Hospital (NCH) project comprises the main hospital on a shared campus at St James&rsquo;s, the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, and the Outpatient and Emergency Care Centre at Tallaght University Hospital.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not been depleted.</p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p>  <p>  Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to over &euro;1.7bn. This includes investment in ICT, a new Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning.</p>  <p>  Brexit, the pandemic and recent geopolitical developments have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, updates on hypothetical costs cannot be provided due to the fact that there is a live contract in place and speculation on any additional costs would be detrimental to the Development Board&rsquo;s commercial engagements.</p></reply>

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.</p><p>Awareness of menopause and its symptoms has been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.</p><p>278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. I published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise in September 2021.</p><p>The first-of-its-kind ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice has been established. In March 2022, Dr. Ciara McCarthy took up post as the Women's Health Clinical Lead. Her role will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in general practice, where the vast majority of advice and services for women at all stages in their health journey is available. Dr McCarthy&rsquo;s appointment comes soon after the successful roll-out of the comprehensive new Certificate course in Community Gynaecology for GPs, which provides GPs with up-to-date training in a range of gynaecological presentations in general practice, with evidence-based learning on best practice, from contraception, sexual health, fertility, HRT and the menopause.</p><p>Additionally, the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce engaged in discussions on menopause through the &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Weekly&rsquo; presentation series in which key stakeholders presented to Taskforce members on important topics in women&rsquo;s health. In November 2019, the topic of &lsquo;Perimenopause and Menopause&rsquo; was presented, the video of this presentation is available on gov.ie and YouTube. </p><p>The HSE has developed a dedicated landing page - hse.ie/menopause - to improve user experience and accessibility to relevant information. </p><p>While the majority of women who seek support for their menopause can be effectively supported within primary care by their GP, approximately 25% of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in menopause. Specifically, this cohort of women will fall within four broad categories:<ol type="1"><li>Treatment does not improve their menopausal symptoms;</li><li>They have on-going troublesome side effects e.g. bleeding;</li><li>They have contra-indications to HRT; and</li><li>There is uncertainty about the most suitable treatment option for their menopausal symptoms e.g. complex medical history.</li></ol>The intention is that these more complex cases can be dealt with in a number of specialist menopause clinics being developed around the country.</p><p>In September 2021, I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-23 committed to developing 4 specialist menopause clinics nationally in 2022. In April, I announced further investment to support 2 additional specialist Menopause Clinics, bringing a total of 6 such clinics nationwide for women who require complex, specialist care. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p><p>Specialist menopause clinics will be provided in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork working to complement the menopause support available to women in their community.</p><p>The first specialist menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital opened in December 2021. The clinic is multidisciplinary, supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and by clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team also provides advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.  </p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:</p> <blockquote> 	-  ‎GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; an ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area.<br /><br />-  ‎‎A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z webpage. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause was held on November 29th, 2021.  <br /><br />-  A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18<sup>th</sup>2021, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service was held on November 30<sup>th</sup>2021. </blockquote>  <p>In addition to the activity outlined above, menopause will continue to be a priority for my department and this Government for 2022 through targeted funding for menopause projects via the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund and implementation of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023.</p></reply>

It was chaired by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases.</p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established.</p>  <p>  On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board, HRB, carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation. </p>  <p>  While some preliminary scoping work has been undertaken by the Department, during the Pandemic all available Department of Health resources were devoted to the Public Health response. This has meant that progress on the development of policy in this area could not be progressed as intended.</p>  <p>  There is still significant work required to develop proposals for consideration by Government regarding vaccine damage compensation. As part of that work, it is anticipated that consideration will also be given to the inclusion of claims relating to alleged adverse reactions from COVID Vaccines.</p></reply>

Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.</p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, and work to progress medium and longer term reform recommendations is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will be undertaken which will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past 2 years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  In addition, I established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group in January 2022. The Expert Group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically. It is important that we have a strong and robust embedded public health system into the future.</p></reply>

The eligibility criteria set by the European Union to qualify expenditure under the Reserve are stringent, and a key criterion is that any proposed expenditure must demonstrate a direct link to negative impacts arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  Within my Department to date, &euro;43 million has been allocated in 2022 for Brexit-related purposes, of which &euro;32 million has been allocated to the fisheries sector, &euro;4 million to the horticultural sector, including &euro;3 million to the seed potato sector which I delivered this week alone and &euro;7 million to fund an Enterprise Ireland capital investment scheme for meat and dairy processing. This investment is being used to fund development of new products and markets as a consequence of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In terms of the potential for further funding for the sector from BAR, including further funding for primary producers, my Department is currently assessing options for eligible measures, including in the context of future-proofing the sector against impacts of Brexit that may not have been fully realised yet.</p>  <p>  These include the potential negative impacts associated with the additional costs that will arise for Irish exporters as a result of the introduction of new UK import controls when they are deployed, as well as the potential impacts that may arise from from future UK trade policy developments. Such measures would seek to maintain the competitiveness of Irish products on the UK market, and support the sector in diversifying and building resilience as a response to these future negative impacts.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders in this regard, as well as with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - the designated body in Ireland to manage BAR funds - in order to confirm which impacts and measures meet the criteria for BAR funding.</p></reply>

This SI transposed the Directive as it stood, as any amendments would have required primary legislation. I also established an interim enforcement authority in my Department which has all the necessary legal powers to enforce the UTP Regulations.</p>  <p>  The UTP Directive and the implementing Regulations apply to business-to-business relationships in the agriculture and food supply chain, subject to certain annual turnover thresholds. </p>  <p>  The business-to-business relationship concerns the contractual arrangement between suppliers and buyers. A farmer supplying to a processor is protected from 16 specific unfair trading practices in relation to their contract with that processor, whether the contract is oral or in writing. Similarly, the processor would be protected from unfair trading practices in their dealings with a retailer who is in a higher threshold bracket.</p>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that on 22nd March last, the Government approved the priority drafting of the General Scheme of the Agricultural and Food Supply Chain Bill 2022. While the Bill allows for changes to be made to the unfair trading practices listed in the current legislation, the UTP rules enforced by the new Office will continue to be based on the business to business relationship between suppliers and buyers. As with any legislation, the impact of the Regulations, and of the Bill when enacted, will be reviewed over time to ensure they are having the effect intended.</p>  <p>  In addition to the enforcement role the Office will have a very important price and market reporting and analysis function which will ensure the increased availability of market information with a view to strengthening the position of farmers, fishers and other suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain against larger buyers with greater bargaining power.   This new office may commission reports on what is happening in markets and on arrangements all along the agri food supply chain and may make recommendations on how matters can be improved, but moreover can provide important information to farmers to allow them improve their decision making. </p>  <p>I am confident that the new office will help strengthen the position of our farmers, fishers, and other suppliers of agricultural and food products in negotiating a fairer price for their produce and it is my intention that the new Office of Fairness and Transparency in the Agri-Food Supply chain will be established over the course of this year. I am committed to delivering this office this year to help further support our farm families and their businesses.  </p></reply>

I understand that an interim report will be submitted to me very soon; and the Chair of the Group made a presentation this week to the Food Vision High Level Implementation Committee on progress to date.  </p>  <p>  I understand that a key further task for the Group, to be completed before the final report is submitted, will be to quantify the metrics associated with the proposed measures; including the impact in carbon dioxide equivalent reduction projections for each measure; the timeframe for implementation; the key costings; and the linkages and alignment between the proposed measures and those in the Climate Action Plan, AgClimatise, Food Vision 2030, and the CAP Strategic Plan. </p>  <p>  I know that the dairy sector, which is the lifeblood of many parts of rural Ireland, is very conscious that the sector needs to stabilise and then reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, in order to contribute to our national ambitions on climate.  </p>  <p>  As well as the legal obligations to meet our climate targets, proof of environmental sustainability is essential in terms of maintaining and indeed growing the value of our dairy exports, which last year amounted to &euro;5 billion, and were exported to up to 140 countries around the world. Maintaining and building on our reputation for safe, nutritious and sustainably produced dairy products and ingredients is key to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of this great sector in the future.  </p>  <p>  The Government will be fully supportive of these efforts. I am confident that working together we can stabilise and then reduce emissions from the dairy sector, positioning Ireland as a world leader in sustainable food systems, meeting our climate targets, and ensuring that the market delivers a reward for our quality, sustainably produced food, particularly for our farmers, and their families who are the bedrock of the sector.</p></reply>

The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>In addition, on the 3rd May 2022, I brought a Memorandum for Information to Government on a proposed Fodder Support Scheme, with the objective of supporting farm families to conserve silage and hay this year to ensure that we have adequate stocks of fodder over next winter. I expect to announce further details on the proposed scheme shortly.  The financial supports previously announced, and those currently under discussion, will assist farmers in meeting the rising costs of fertiliser and in providing sufficient fodder for Winter 2022.  </p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This is a credible roadmap that will help farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser. </p>  <p>  I continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and am actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds. This is period of considerable challenge for our sector. I have taken a proactive approach to supporting our farm families and their businesses and I will continue to do so.</p></reply>

At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined. </p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.  I have made clear that this review must be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, all stakeholders have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to doing all possible through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  I have established a national Common Fisheries Policy Review group of relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP Review, to advise me on priorities for the negotiations and to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The Group is chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, and assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former Director of the MI and EPA and Mr. Donal Maguire, former Director in BIM.  The Group involves representatives of key stakeholders, including industry representative groups and the environmental NGOs.  I look forward to receiving this report which will provide a strong basis for progressing all aspects of Ireland's case for change in the CFP.</p></reply>

It is the Department's commitment to ensure that the current market and potential markets for Irish organic beef are explored, are viable and will lead to an optimal price premium for farmers. </p>  <p>  A significant proportion of the organic beef produced in Ireland is destined for customers on the domestic market with all of the major retailers in the Irish market listing organic beef in some capacity. Irish organic beef is also exported to Germany, Britain, Netherlands and the Nordics, however, it is difficult to get an indication of export market share at this time. </p>  <p>  Organic beef production in Ireland has been estimated at 3,150 tonnes in 2021 which accounts for less than one per cent of overall beef production (619,800 tonnes CSO).</p>  <p>  Bord Bia, under the aegis of the Department, continues to invest in identifying and supporting export market opportunities for Irish organic companies (including those seeking to export beef) through their network of overseas offices and trade events. </p>  <p>  Central to this is the planned return to the BioFach trade fair in July 2022. This is the leading trade fair for organic produce in Europe. Bord Bias organic client companies will be able to build new business and generate new leads. Bord Bia, along with DAFM, will deliver a Ministerial Trade Mission to Germany around Biofach to help advance lead generation activities in Europe&rsquo;s largest organic market.</p>  <p>  There is currently a project under way in Bord Bia to quantify the volume of organic produce available for the domestic retail market/export in each individual category. This will allow Bord Bia to best align its supports to the Irish organic sector.  Bord Bia will also be engaging in a promotional campaign in Summer 2022 with key retailers on the domestic market to raise awareness of Irish organic products. This will improve understanding and grow preference amongst Irish consumers for all categories of Irish organic produce, including beef.</p>  <p>  There are very real challenges that exist when it comes to growing and co-ordinating the supply base of organic beef so that the sector is well placed to benefit from the growing demand for organic produce. </p>  <p>  To reap the benefits of growing demand for organic produce it is important that we have increased supply available on a consistent basis. The significant leakage of product in the beef sector between farm of origin and final processing is a particular issue.  The Organic Strategy Forum which has met twice in 2022 will be examining this topic further in 2022 with a view to addressing all the issues that cause product leakage to occur with a view to recommending remedial actions.</p></reply>

Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to legal challenge in the Courts.  </p>  <p>  Consultation on the management of quotas within National Policy is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). The QMAC examines in detail the operation of each fishery, available quota and uptake patterns for the different metiers of fishing vessels. Detailed discussions are held taking account of the situation of the fleet and the market. Any issues relating to the management of the Mackerel quota allocation to the relevant fisheries as set down in National Policy,  are discussed by the QMAC and recommendations are brought to my attention to inform my decision. </p>  <p>  As recommended by the QMAC, National Policy for Quota Balancing has been put in place to support the landing obligation for both demersal and pelagic stocks including Mackerel. Quota balancing, where a &lsquo;balancing adjustment&rsquo; is made from a future allocation of a fishing opportunity, is a conservation measure that aids industry in matching available quota to actual catch to support the effective operation of the landing obligation (discards ban).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Ireland, fishing quotas, including the Mackerel quota, are a public resource. It is worth noting that within the EU, most quota systems have been privatised for their main commercial stocks. In Ireland, allocations are not owned by the vessel and when an allocation is not fished it is returned to the State for redistribution to the fleet.  This  policy helps to support an Irish-owned and operated fleet with operations based in Ireland.  If the fleet were not Irish owned, there would likely be a rapid concentration of ownership in a small number of international companies which are not likely to operate from Ireland and may not have any commercial links with Ireland. The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet that have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities.</p></reply>

At these meetings I underlined the need to closely monitor supply chains to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market, and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused.  </p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the need to address the multiple impacts of the illegal invasion in Ukraine on food supply chains and food security, I have secured significant additional national funding towards support measures this year including our beef and suckler farmers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that on 3rd May 2022, I brought a Memorandum for Information to Government on a proposed Fodder Support Scheme, with the objective of supporting farm families to conserve silage and hay during summer 2022, to ensure that there are sufficient stocks of fodder in the country for next winter. This scheme will require approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department is continuing to engage with that Department on the funding aspects of the scheme. I expect to announce further details on the proposed scheme shortly. </p>  <p>  More generally for the beef sector, my Department provides a range of financial aids to support beef farm incomes and to support economic and environmental efficiency. The core support for the beef sector under the current Rural Development Programme is the &euro;300 Million Beef Data and Genomics Programme. In addition to BDGP, significant additional supports have been made available specifically to the beef sector in recent years, for example through the BEEP and  BEEP-S schemes.</p>  <p>  I continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and I am actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds. This is period of considerable challenge for the agri-food sector as a whole. I have taken a proactive approach, through the various measures I have announced since this crisis started, to support our farm families and their businesses and I will continue to do so.</p></reply>

There is significant research work ongoing in relation to methane emissions and dairy, and indeed, it is clear that future research investments will be needed in this area.</p>  <p>  One of the most exciting research breakthroughs in recent times is the use of the feed additive 3 Nitro-Oxy-Propanol, (3-NOP) that has been proven to have the ability to reduce enteric methane emissions. </p>  <p>  The feed additive 3NOP, which can reduce methane emissions in the rumen of animals by approximately 30% for indoor systems, has recently been approved by the European Food Safety Authority.  While the technology has been proven to work in indoor confined systems of livestock production, Teagasc has also commenced work on how the technology can be used in a grass-based system. I will continue to support Teagasc in developing these types of technologies.</p>  <p>  New technologies such as anaerobic digestion are specifically referenced in the Climate Action Plan and they also help reduce emissions. My Department supports Teagasc to deliver these important methane-focused projects as well as supporting Teagasc advisers and research staff to deliver these targets.</p>  <p>  DNA technology has also led to significant improvement in animal breeding in recent times. My Department is in collaboration with Teagasc and ICBF as we continue to focus on efficiencies in producing high-quality animal protein. Teagasc is in collaboration with DAFM and ICBF to develop a carbon sub index that can be included in the EBI.  It is hoped eventually to be able to select directly for lower enteric methane emitting cows using the carbon sub index.</p>  <p>  We are currently funding two methane specific research projects including the development and validation of novel technologies to reduce methane emissions from pasture based Irish agricultural systems and investigating Seaweeds and seaweed-ingredients to reduce enteric methane emissions from pasture-based sheep, cattle and dairy cows in collaborations with Teagasc and Irish universities.</p></reply>

The Regulations were welcomed by welfare organisations.</p>  <p>  Extracts from the Register of Sellers and Suppliers of Pet Animals and the Register of Premises (name of seller or supplier, registration number and the county of the premises used in connection with the sale and supply of pets) are published on the Department's website at gov.ie - Rules on the Sale, Supply and Advertising of Pet Animals (www.gov.ie). The Department's website has additional guidance for potential pet owners thinking of acquiring a pet, further supporting potential purchasers in making informed decisions.</p>  <p>  There were 1,247 pet sellers and suppliers registered on the Register of Sellers and Suppliers of Pet Animals and the Register of Premises at the end of 2021. An additional 277 have registered in 2022 as of 20th May, 2022.</p>  <p>  The requirement to register with my Department as a seller or supplier of pet animals under the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019 does not apply to a person who is required to register with their local authority under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010. Dog breeding establishments are regulated under that Act and fall under the remit of the Minister for Rural and Community Development. Controls relating to these establishments rest with that Department and the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  Any evidence of animal cruelty or neglect of an animal&rsquo;s welfare should be brought to the attention of my Department by calling the animal welfare helpline on 076 1064408 (Call Save) or 01 6072379 or by emailing animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million. </p><p>The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow protein crops in 2022. Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops is a key mechanism to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed material</p><p>The package also includes a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure, to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yields.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that on 3<sup>rd</sup>May 2022, I brought a Memorandum for Information to Government on a proposed Fodder Support Scheme, with the objective of supporting farm families to conserve silage and hay this year to ensure that nationally we have adequate stocks of fodder over next winter. Any such scheme would have to be targeted towards those farmers who are at greatest risk of not having sufficient fodder for winter 2022. In that context, based on recent Teagasc survey data, this is more of a challenge in relation to the beef  and sheep sectors than it is for the dairy sector. </p><p>Such a scheme will require approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department is continuing to engage with that Department on the funding aspects of the scheme. I expect to announce further details on the proposed scheme shortly. </p><p>The financial supports previously announced, and those currently under discussion, will assist farmers in providing sufficient fodder for winter 2022.  I remain committed to standing by our farm families during this time of crisis.</p></reply>

Following a record year for Family Farm Income in 2021, Teagasc has forecast that a decline in 2022 is now highly likely, as output price increases will fail to offset the rise in production costs. Significantly higher production costs will be a feature across all sectors in 2022, with higher fertiliser, feed and fuel prices leading to an increase in agriculture input costs. The current market outlook for output prices is uncertain, with upward pressure likely, but very unlikely to cover the additional input costs.  </p>  <p>  Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p>  <p>  There are sufficient supplies of fertiliser and animal feed at present although price remains a concern. The Government have introduced a temporary reduction in excise duty on fuels, assistance on the price of electricity &amp;amp; gas, and a targeted and temporary grant scheme for hauliers, all of which will be of some assistance to farmers and the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  I have announced a number of measures over the past three months to assist the agriculture sector including:</p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million in two packages for the pig sector, </p>  <p>  - &euro;12 million for the tillage sector </p>  <p>  - &euro;3 million for the horticulture sector</p>  <p>  These targeted measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder (silage and/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a Fodder crisis during the coming winter. My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Following discussions at EU level, the European Commission announced in March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. It includes &euro;500 million in exceptional aid to support farmers most affected, including an allocation of &euro;15.8 million to Ireland, and agreement to deploy measures to support specific markets.</p>  <p>  In addition, on the future of Ireland's agri-food sector generally, you will be aware that the new Food Vision 2030 strategy was launched last August. Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector and is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions. Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems, which would deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, environmental and social basis to generate food and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This will deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>

This increased global demand has impacted on supplies and put upward pressure on prices. </p>  <p>  Also, the increased price of gas, which is a key input into Nitrogen fertiliser production, has had a significant impact in recent months and continues to contribute to further upward trend in fertiliser prices. </p>  <p>  As gas accounts for a high percentage of operating costs for the production of N fertiliser, some European Nitrogen producers had scaled back production and halted operations in some cases. However, many of these production facilities have now come back on stream in light of the likely increased economic returns of the present market situation.</p>  <p>  EU anti-dumping measures on imports of fertilisers from certain Third Countries have added to the price of fertiliser imports, however, the EU Commission is currently examining the effects of removing these tariffs. </p>  <p>  The significant increase of fertiliser is having an impact at farm level and it is something I am acutely aware of.

The year-on-year spread and impact of the disease on ash, one of our most important native broadleaves is expected to increase whether ash is found in a forest, hedgerow or roadside.  The  landscape, cultural, ecological and economic impact will be significant.</p>  <p>  The exact origin of ash dieback disease in Ireland or when it was introduced are unknown. It is likely that the disease was introduced into Ireland on infected plants for use in either forest, farm or roadside planting.</p>  <p>  The experience of ash dieback disease provides clear evidence of the increasing threat to our plant health status through a combination of trade and climate change.</p>  <p>  The Department has taken a number of significant steps in response to this experience, including the publication of its Plant Health and Biosecurity Strategy, the establishment of a new area of expertise in the Department in Pest Risk Analysis and in financial support to growers impacted to allow them to remove infected ash and replace it with other suitable species. I understand that a small percentage of the ash population thought to be 1%-2% may be disease tolerant.</p>  <p>  The Department has, and continues to, support a number of research initiatives in order to identify tolerant ash trees for use in ash breeding programmes for the future.</p>  <p>  Since the first finding of ash dieback disease in Ireland, the Department has provided support totalling over &euro;7 million to owners of ash plantations impacted by ash dieback disease through the ash dieback reconstitution scheme (introduced in 2013) and more recently the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS &ndash; Ash dieback) introduced in July 2020.  We have committed under the Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 to refocus on the delivery of most approvals under the  Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme.</p>  <p>  Applications for that scheme are received regularly and decisions are issued as the assessment of the applications are complete.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department is currently developing a New Forestry  Programme for 2023-2027 which is examining all aspects of the afforestation programme and support schemes.</p>  <p>  The Department is also currently examining the uptake of the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme(Ash Dieback) in 2022 and the challenges faced by the owners of ash plantations in availing of the scheme in the context of the current year planned expenditure.</p></reply>

The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. I am acutely aware of the challenges pig farmers are facing at present.</p>  <p>  In March, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. Farmers were able to receive a payment of up to &euro;20,000 per farmer. Over 80% of applications have since been processed for payment. The remaining applications are currently being processed.</p>  <p>  On 13th April, I announced the Government's approval for exceptional aid supports of &euro;15.8 million for the pig and horticulture sector, which will be funded from Ireland's envelope of EU exceptional adjustment aid under Commission delegated regulation 2022/467. The approval was for &euro;13 million for the pig sector and &euro;2.8 million for the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  Member States are required to notify the Commission of the measures to be taken before 30th June, and to pay the supports by 30th September 2022. We are working hard developing the scheme  in order to deliver a rapid as possible payment to farm families.</p>  <p>  In addition to the two support measures I have just detailed, I have had ongoing discussions with the main banks to discuss the current challenges in the pigmeat sector and the importance of their ongoing support through the current downturn in the business cycle.  The key message to farmers experiencing cashflow difficulties is to engage with the banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Separately, I met with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to discuss the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID- 19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which are co-financed by my Department. These finance schemes can be used for working capital finance and include features which address the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  The financial schemes detailed above are part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets, with dedicated media advertising campaigns under way nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the options available to them. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18 metres length overall targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was introduced in March 2019 to give effect to the changes.</p>  <p>  A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy Directive. On 6th October 2020, the High Court judgment held that the Policy Directive was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. As the Deputy is aware, I appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal and a full hearing took place on 22nd June 2021. Judgment on the case is reserved.</p>  <p>  I also sought an extension on the stay on the order of the High Court, which was granted by the Court of Appeal on 19th March 2021, reinstating the Policy Directive, and which was extended by the Court of Appeal following the full hearing on 22nd June. On 23rd September 2021, the Court of Appeal refused the Minister&rsquo;s application to continue the stay further. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring 'that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and recreational fishers and that pair trawling will be prohibited inside the six-mile limit.' I wish to assure the Deputy that I am fully supportive of this objective.</p>  <p>  I am awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeal to inform next steps. As the matter is sub judice, I cannot comment further until the matter can be resolved before the Courts.</p></reply>

In that context it is important to recognise that Ireland is part of the EU single market and participates in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is the key mechanism for ensuring food security throughout Europe.</p>  <p>  Specifically in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained. The European Commission announced in March, via the communication, "Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems", a range of actions to enhance global food security and support farmers and consumers across the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. </p>  <p>  The Commission communication sets out actions in three areas. First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world. Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens. Third, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come. </p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in fertiliser use on farms to date this year in response to Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser campaign. I tasked Teagasc with developing this roadmap to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser, which was launched earlier this year. It is a credible roadmap that will be good for the environment, as well as addressing some of the concerns around fertiliser prices.</p>  <p>  In March, I announced a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector worth over &euro;12 million with the aim of supporting the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multispecies swards. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser, while also reducing our dependency on imports.</p>  <p>  The tillage incentive scheme will incentivise farmers to grow additional crops such as barley, oats and wheat this year. The scheme is targeted at increasing the overall tillage area and making a real impact on increasing our supply.</p>  <p>  The multispecies sward scheme, including support for red clover, is aimed at reducing nitrogen fertiliser use while maintaining forage yields. Multispecies swards have been proven to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser while maintaining forage output.</p>  <p>  These targeted measures will help Irish farmers diversify at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder (silage and/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a Fodder crisis during the coming winter. My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, on the future of Ireland's agri-food sector generally, you will be aware that the new Food Vision 2030 strategy was launched last August. Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector and is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions. Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems, which would deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, environmental and social basis to generate food and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This will deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment.</p>  <p>  I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>

This detailed the most recent estimates of Family Farm Incomes (FFI), showing that:</p>  <p>  - Dairy farms had the highest average FFI per hectare of &euro;1,223 in 2020. </p>  <p>  - Tillage had the next highest margin per hectare at &euro;525</p>  <p>  - Drystock farms recorded an average FFI per hectare of &euro;295 for Cattle Rearing farms, &euro;408 for Cattle Other farms, &euro;403 for sheep farms and &euro;449 for Mixed Livestock farms. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that these margins are calculated using mean average farm sizes. The FFI within the given systems, and its distribution, varies considerably within each farm system type, as detailed in the NFS.</p>  <p>  These estimates use data for the year 2020. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the economic context has changed significantly since then. Teagasc issued an updated Situation and Outlook for Irish Agriculture in April, following the illegal Russian Invasion of Ukraine. This highlighted the impact of the war for agricultural input costs, output prices and margins, including variation in anticipated effects across each of the main farming systems. </p>  <p>  Even before Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine, agricultural prospects for 2022 were dominated by concerns relating, to cost pressures that began to build up over the second half of 2021. However, the war in Ukraine has led to a sharper and more widespread increase in farm input prices, particularly for feed, fertiliser and fuel, than had been anticipated. </p>  <p>  The situation and outlook remain uncertain, and I am closely monitoring events in terms of their implications for Irish Family Farm Incomes. I am committed to supporting family farm enterprises and have introduced a number of measures over the past three months to assist the agriculture and fishing sector.  These targeted measures will help Irish farmers and fishers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine.</p></reply>

We will continue to maintain a strong strategic focus on optimizing the contribution of the sector to our economy.</p><p>The agri-food sector has benefited from an approach to strategic planning through the development of ten-year stakeholder-led strategies, revised every five years. Since their inception, these strategies have ensured that the sector has a coherent, stakeholder-led vision and strategy to underpin the sector&rsquo;s continued development. </p><p>The new strategy, Food Vision 2030, was published in August last year. One of the standout aspects of Food Vision is that it has adopted a food systems approach, taking a holistic view of agri-food by ensuring an interconnectedness between food, health &amp;amp; nutrition and between food and the environment. Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in sustainable food systems. This means that it will be profitable throughout (economic sustainability), have a positive or neutral impact on the natural environment (environmental sustainability), and have broad based benefits for society (social sustainability). </p><p>Food Vision sets out over 200 actions under 22 goals which are grouped around four high-level Missions for the sector to work towards: <ol type="1"><li>A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector.</li><li>Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being.</li><li>Food that is Safe, Nutritious and Appealing, Trusted and Valued at Home and Abroad.</li><li>An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, Driven by Technology &amp; Talent.</li></ol>Food Vision outlines a roadmap to deliver on the ambition of a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030. It takes a systematic approach to addressing the challenge of ensuring that Ireland can continue to produce high quality food in a manner that protects the environment and mitigates climate change. The targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are challenging but I know that the sector is committed to the challenge. Delivering real results will require collaboration, cooperation, and a sense of shared responsibility between citizens, industry and the State to deliver our environmental ambitions.</p><p>The success of any strategy is in its monitoring and implementation framework, allowing any negative impacts to be identified and for actions to be progressed in a responsible way.  </p><p>Food Vision includes a detailed monitoring and implementation framework that has four key elements. The first is working in partnership with all stakeholders in the chain from farm to fork. The second is monitoring of key indicators and targets for the four missions and the publication of a detailed implementation plan. The third is monitoring implementation and the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee, chaired by myself. The fourth is environmental monitoring, review and reporting. This includes many of the recommendations from the Strategic Environmental Assessment and the Appropriate Assessment, as well as the work of a Food Vision Environmental Working Group. </p><p>Implementation of the Strategy is well underway, with many of its actions already commenced. The Food Vision Environmental Group and the Food Vision Dairy Group are progressing priority actions.</p></reply>

EIPs are a really important and successful model of farming communities working together for the betterment of farming and the environment. </p>  <p>  The BRIDE project on biodiversity is one of these EIPs and is an excellent example of an innovative agri-environment project based in a river catchment.  </p>  <p>  The aim of this EIP is to design and implement a results-based approach to conserve, enhance, and restore habitats in lowland intensive farmland.    </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s proposed new agri-environment climate measure (AECM) under the next CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) will be building on the learnings and experience of these EIPs including those of the BRIDE. Subject to approval by the EU Commission of the CSP, the new AECM will have two streams &ndash; General and Co-operation (CP).  </p>  <p>  The CP stream will be managed by new Co-operation Project Teams and represents a scaling-up of the EIP model and the learnings gained.  </p>  <p>  The new AECM has been developed taking into account the excellent collaborative work done by these pilot projects, including the BRIDE EIP, in developing and testing innovative solutions to challenges in the agri-environment sector.  One of the aims of these pilot projects was to offer an opportunity for a broad range of people &ndash; farmers, scientists, advisors &ndash; to work together to overcome problems relating to the interaction between farming and the environment in their local area. The outcome of their work in such areas as results-based management of land will now be extended beyond a pilot project to the whole of the country.</p>  <p>  The BRIDE EIP is due to finish at the end of 2022 and I look forward to receiving its final report. However we will be continuing to support the work of this project through the new AECM throughout the whole State. I would encourage farmers participating in this and other EIPs to apply to join the AECM Scheme &ndash; either the General or Co-operation stream, as appropriate to their location, when the Scheme opens for applications later this year.</p></reply>

The Results-Based Environment Agri Pilot Programme (REAP) will run to the end of 2022. While parcels brought into REAP may not be converted to forestry during the term of the REAP contract, it is not a whole-of-farm project. Afforestation opportunities continue to exist for REAP participants on parcels that have not been selected for the project.</p>  <p>  My Department fully recognises the need for afforestation to be complementary to the CAP Agri-Environmental Schemes.  Newly-planted forestry will continue to qualify for the new Basic Income Support Payment, subject to the underlying rules for eligibility for the afforestation Single Payment Scheme (SPS).  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the CAP Strategic Plan, various tree planting actions have been included in the Pillar II Agri-Environment Climate Measure (AECM). Furthermore, the planting of trees or participation on agroforestry or native woodland establishment schemes will qualify the applicant for higher status in ranking and selection thereby giving the applicant a greater chance of being awarded an AECM contract. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, this Government is committed to a new national Forestry Programme for the period 2023-2027, which will be the main implementation vehicle of the new Forest Strategy. This new Forestry Programme will focus on the importance of climate smart forestry and new afforestation will be encouraged in pursuit of climate, water, biodiversity and commercial objectives</p>  <p>  An amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 has passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. This amendment was necessary to remove the licensing requirement for the planting of native woodland in areas not greater than one hectare. It is my objective to increase and encourage interest in small scale planting and I am confident that this change to the Act will remove a barrier to such planting.</p>  <p>  The exemption for the creation of up to one hectare of native woodland would be available through a scheme which my Department now intends to design and implement.  It is hoped that such a scheme will contribute to the stated policy goal of incentivising small-scale tree planting and of re-engaging farmers with afforestation.</p></reply>

However, it must be noted that the MACC is not a static analysis and will be subject to revisions as both the scientific knowledge and socioeconomic conditions evolve. </p>  <p>  On the measures specifically highlighted by the Deputy, the MACC, as published in 2019, refers to the afforestation of 7,000 ha per year; estimated to sequester 2.1 MtCO2e. It also refers to the rewetting of 40,000 ha of organic grassland soils; estimated to sequester 0.44 MtCO2e over the period.

My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that the price applied in the PSC must be updated to reflect this enhanced ambition, with that work, by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, expected to take place in the coming months. </p>  <p>  An exercise to assess the value of GHG savings over the twenty year timeframe calculated at this carbon price has not been undertaken to date. It is something that is worth consideration when the methodologies are revised.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that I am committed to supporting initiatives to facilitate the sector in reaching its climate targets, such as the work ongoing in the Food Vision Dairy Group, and will continue to engage so that we can together achieve the ambition of being a world leader in sustainable food systems. </p></reply>

This means issuing on average around  20  afforestation licences per week is the target.  Up to 20th May, we have issued 299 afforestation licences, which I acknowledge is  below the projected average.  It is, however, inevitable, in the context of the annual target figures, there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week. In the week ending 20th May, we issued 18 afforestation licences and I am confident that we will reach our annual target. To this end we have recruited additional ecology resources and these 36 Full Time equivalents will begin to positively impact output.</p>  <p>  In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on the Departmental website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week. </p></reply>

I look forward to the upcoming proposal from the European Commission for an EU regulatory framework for the certification of carbon removals in this regard. </p>  <p>  To gain a deeper understanding of relevant issues, I have recently convened a Carbon Farming Working Group, chaired by officials from my department and initially drawing on expertise from across semi-state and governmental Departments to explore opportunities for the development of practices which encourage the removal of carbon in line with developments at EU level. </p>  <p>  In development of a carbon farming framework  the establishment of baseline data, auditing, the development of voluntary carbon codes, leveraging of private financing through public/private partnerships, and the putting in place of good governance structures will be required.</p>  <p>  Like many other EU countries, Ireland is beginning to develop experience and knowledge in this area. I have recently provided funding through for initiatives such as the establishment of the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory, the Pilot Soil Sampling Programme and the Farm Environmental Scheme along with a number of European Innovation Partnership (EIP) research projects, to provide the required data for the development of future policy options in this area. In addition, The Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) run by my department is an early example of an initiative which makes a payment for ecosystem services, including carbon capture.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe that Carbon farming is an area that will become a crucial part of the future of farming in this country. I know this will be a real opportunity for farmers to derive a new income stream for their farm and I will drive this very exciting opportunity forward.  </p></reply>

At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of fertiliser, animal feed and fuel.</p>  <p>  While primary responsibility for the taxation of fuel is with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agri-food sector and the economy generally.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) that are used as motor or heating fuels. Gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of MOT is marked green and is usually referred to as MGO, green diesel or agricultural diesel. </p>  <p>  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. The current rate of MOT on MGO is &euro;111.14 per 1000 litres.  This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 litres.</p>  <p>  In March this year, the Minister for Finance reduced the rate on MGO by 2 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 10 March. The Minister for Finance has also provided for an additional 3 cent (VAT inclusive) reduction in MOT for MGO with effect from 1 May until Budget night in October. This brings the total reduction to 5 cent, reducing the non-carbon component, or excise, to nil. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p>  <p>  I would also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. It is an additional tax measure for farmers introduced in Budget 2012 which compensates increases in the carbon tax from the 2012 base rate of &euro;15 per tonne of CO2 emission. </p>  <p>  This measure means that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). </p>  <p>  My colleagues across Government and I continue monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. I am acutely aware of the challenges pig farmers are facing at present.</p>  <p>  In March, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. Farmers were able to receive a payment of up to &euro;20,000 per farmer. Over 80% of applications have since been processed for payment. The remaining applications are currently being processed.</p>  <p>  On 13th April, I announced the Government's approval for exceptional aid supports of &euro;15.8 million for the pig and horticulture sector, which will be funded from Ireland's envelope of EU exceptional adjustment aid under Commission delegated regulation 2022/467. The approval was for &euro;13 million for the pig sector and &euro;2.8 million for the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  Member States are required to notify the Commission of the measures to be taken before 30th June, and to pay the supports by 30th September 2022. My officials are developing the scheme at present in order to deliver a rapid as possible payment to farm families.</p>  <p>  In addition to the two support measures I have just detailed, I have had ongoing discussions with the main banks to discuss the current challenges in the pigmeat sector and the importance of their ongoing support through the current downturn in the business cycle.  The key message to farmers experiencing cashflow difficulties is to engage with the banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Separately, I met with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to discuss the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID- 19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which are co-financed by my Department. These finance schemes can be used for working capital finance and include features which address the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  The financial schemes detailed above are part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets, with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the options available to them. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p></reply>

However, both our Departments work closely to ensure it is consistent with Government priorities for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  Agricultural property, such as farmland, benefits from tax relief under Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). The purpose of this relief is to facilitate succession and the intergenerational transfer of viable farm enterprises. The Report on the Tax Treatment of Solar Panels on Farmland, published in September 2017, examined the treatment of solar panels on farmland. It outlined recommendations including a number of possible options for the consideration of the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  Measures contained in Budget 2018 and Finance Act 2017 gave effect to the Minister of Finance&rsquo;s chosen option with CAT agricultural relief and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief changed to allow the leasing of agricultural land for solar infrastructure to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity, subject to the panels covering no more than 50% of the holding.</p>  <p>  The Report noted that while solar developments on farms will inevitably reduce agricultural production the 50% condition &ldquo;will at least discourage passive farming which is possible in an unfettered approach and where there is no requirement to have agricultural activity&rdquo;. It further noted that changing the law could potentially &ldquo;fuel further speculation in the solar energy market as there may be pressure to engage with the farmers with larger holdings with the most viable solar project locations&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Finance and stakeholders to ensure that tax strategy aligns with Government strategy and the needs of the agri-food sector and wider society.</p></reply>

In this regard Teagasc are organising three farm walks which will take place in June that focus specifically on the Beef sector.  These events outline best practice and allow both organic and conventional farmers to see first hand the practicalities of organic beef production.  The events are publicised on both Teagasc and my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the beef sector by aligning it closely with the market opportunities. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, is also undertaking a trade mission to Germany in July 2022 to coincide with Biofach, the largest organic trade fair in Europe.  This will enable organic client companies to build new business and generate new leads and ensure that all efforts are undertaken to expand the export market for Irish Organic produce.  </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;21 million was allocated to the Organic Farming Scheme in 2022, an increase of &euro;5 million from the previous year.  I have introduced changes to the scheme by reducing the required stocking rate and also by increasing the area paid at the higher rate from 60 hectares to 70 hectares, measures which I believe will encourage new entrants to organic farming.  </p>  <p>  For the years 2023 &ndash; 2027, I have proposed an allocation of &euro;256m under the new CAP to continue the development and growth of the organic sector. </p>  <p>  We have also provided  funding to the Agricultural Consultants Association to increase Advisory support in the sector and Teagasc are also in the process of recruiting further personnel to their Organic Farming Advisory Service. This will ensure farmers have access to professional advice to aid in the important decision making process. </p>  <p>  The Organic Strategy forum has met twice in 2022 and the theme of the most recent meeting on 19 May 2022 was &ldquo;Driving participation in Organic Farming&rdquo;.   Our aim is to increase the overall participation in Organic farming and ensure that all sectors are supported equally. </p></reply>

The advice includes applying sufficient fertiliser on grassland and crops, on the basis of a fodder budget for winter 2022 so as ensure that sufficient fodder is conserved. In addition, Teagasc commenced a nationwide advertisement campaign giving advice to farmers along with extensive engagement with farmer clients. </p><p>On the 22nd March 2022, I also announced a Targeted Intervention Package framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility. The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.  </p><p>The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow protein crops in 2022. Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops is a key mechanism to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed materials. </p><p>The package also includes a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure, to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yields.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that on 3<sup>rd</sup>May 2022, I brought a Memorandum for Information to Government on a proposed Fodder Support Scheme, with the objective of supporting farm families to conserve silage and hay this year to ensure that nationally we have adequate stocks of fodder over next winter. Any such scheme would have to be targeted towards those farmers who are at greatest risk of not having sufficient fodder for winter 2022. </p><p>In that context, based on recent Teagasc survey data, this is more of a challenge in relation to the beef  and sheep sectors than it is for the dairy sector. In addition, in light of current milk prices, the economic viability of dairy farming in general, is stronger than beef or sheep farming.</p><p>Such a scheme will require approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department is continuing to engage with that Department on the funding aspects of the scheme. I expect to announce further details on the proposed scheme shortly.  </p><p>The financial supports previously announced, and those currently under discussion, will assist farmers in providing sufficient fodder for winter 2022.  I remain committed to standing by our farm families during this time of crisis.</p></reply>

The result is a rating for the field on a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) with the overall score achieved determining the rate of payment issued to the group or individual farmer. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department has invested significantly in a range of research and demonstration activities in recent years including funding for initiatives such as the establishment of the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory (NASCO), the Pilot Soil Sampling Programme and the Farm Environmental Scheme along with the RePeat mapping study of organic soils and investment in European Innovation Partnership (EIP) research projects such as Farm PEAT &amp;amp; FarmCarbon, which are investigating how to encourage farmers to take actions to reduce emissions from carbon rich soils.   </p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU aid and over &euro;27 million Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall as a result of disturbance to the market. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme, under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU, was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021  compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019. </p>  <p>  Reviewing or amending this requirement at this stage is not an option as the scheme ended at the end of December 2021 when the deferred reduction period ended. The money was paid in advance to the participants who committed themselves to the explicit condition that they would make the 5% reduction as set out in the BEAM Terms and Conditions.  </p>  <p>  Any change would be a  breach  of the EU regulation under which the &euro;50 million was granted to Ireland.  It would  also be grossly unfair to the almost 22,000 participants who met their commitments under the scheme. In addition, it would be unfair on the approximately 21,000 beef finishers who were eligible for a payment under the scheme, but chose not to participate in the scheme, having reviewed the commitments required, which included the 5% reduction. Their average payment would have been over &euro;1,300 each.</p>  <p>  Therefore, there can be no changes to the scheme as it is now closed. </p></reply>

Authorised officers have the power to intervene before welfare situations become even more serious instead of waiting for problems to occur. </p>  <p>  They often offer guidance, advice and direction during inspections. The Act also includes additional enforcement procedures such as Animal Health and Welfare Notices. These notices may be issued both as an instruction on the steps which must be taken to alleviate any animal welfare issues and to deal with potential disease risks and situations in which animal welfare is compromised and provide the opportunity to rectify welfare concerns before they deteriorate further and can avoid the need to resort to prosecution.</p>  <p>  In addition to continued and vigorous enforcement of the law, the Department is committed to a policy of education and awareness-building in order to prevent animal welfare issues arising. Significant animal welfare related measures have been advanced recently within the scope of our national Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025, Working Together for Animal Welfare.</p></reply>

These are challenging targets. </p>  <p>  The achievement of this target will take a whole-of-government, whole-of-sector approach, but I remain confident in the sector's ability to achieve its climate targets. </p>  <p>  Specific greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures included in National Climate Action Plan 2021 for the agriculture sector, to be implemented to achieve the target emissions reduction by 2030, include:</p>  <p>  - An overall reduction in chemical nitrogen fertiliser use to 325,000 tonnes by 2030. The Plan places significant emphasis on measures that will maintain grass productivity with reduced levels of chemical fertiliser use. These measures include an increased use of lime on farms, a greater uptake of low emission slurry spreading technology, and the use of clover and multispecies swards within our grass based system, which are less dependant on chemical nitrogen inputs. On nitrogen the plan also sets out a significant shift towards the use of nitrogen fertilisers containing inhibitors (Protected Urea).</p>  <p>  - Improved animal breeding by providing targets for milk recording on dairy farms and weight recording on suckler beef farms.</p>  <p>  - Improved animal feeding by focusing on utilising feed additives during the housing period and reducing the crude protein content of livestock feeding stuffs.  </p>  <p>  - Reducing the average finishing age of cattle across the decade through improving production efficiencies on our farms.</p>  <p>  - Improved sustainability of our food system will also be achieved through significant increases in the area organically farmed in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Plan also commits agriculture to providing feedstocks toward the production by 2030 of 1.6 TWh per annum of indigenous sustainably-produced biomethane for injection into the gas grid by 2030. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Plan sets out further measures that will be necessary for agriculture to meet its targets, these include agroforestry, afforestation, developing a carbon farming model and exploring methane-reducing feed additives for pasture-based solutions. </p>  <p>  By implementing the measures contained within the Climate Action Plan, I am confident that we can transition the sector to a more long term sustainable platform, with co-benefits for water, air quality and biodiversity, while at all times, maintaining productivity in the sector. I have repeatedly indicated that research and innovation will be needed over the decade in order to bring the sector into compliance with its carbon budget ceiling, a position which is very much consistent with all sectors of the economy. </p></reply>

The payments issued from TAMS since 2014 up  to the present date address specifically Article  17(1)(a) of this Regulation.  </p>  <p>  To encourage on-farm renewable technology uptake and usage, grant aid is provided through TAMS to assist farmers in maximising their contribution to the production of renewable energy through the installation of Solar PV technology along with battery storage on Irish farms. The solar PV systems grant-aided under TAMS include Solar PV Panels and Solar PV Rechargeable Batteries and Solar Panels for water heating under the Pig and Poultry Capital Investment Scheme. The grant aid under TAMS is available at the standard rate of 40%, with a higher grant rate of 60% available to qualified young farmers.</p>  <p>  Article 81 of 1305/2013 sets out the regulatory requirements and indicates that unless Regulation 1305/2013 sets out a different position the State aid requirements apply. The State aid requirements are under Commission Regulation (EU) No 702/2014 and Article 14 (4) states the following: </p>  <p>  The investment may be linked to the production at farm-level of energy from renewable sources, provided that such production does not exceed the average annual consumption of fuels or energy of the given farm. Where the investment is made for the production of thermal energy and electricity from renewable sources on agricultural holdings, the production facilities shall serve only the beneficiary's own energy needs and their production capacity shall be no more than the equivalent to the combined average annual energy consumption of thermal energy and electricity on the agricultural holding, including the farm household. </p>  <p>  The current State aid Guidelines in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas have applied since 1st July 2014 and will expire on 31 December 2022. The European Commission proposed changes to the Guidelines in order to align the current rules with the new CAP and other current EU strategic priorities. On 11th January 2022 the Commission launched a public consultation on the draft revised draft Guidelines, which closed on 13th March 2022. In addition to the public consultation, the proposed draft revised  draft Guidelines were discussed at meetings between the Commission and Member States, which took place on 10th March 2022. Adoption of the revised rules is planned for the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  It is also proposed that support for renewable energy investments will continue under the new Capital Investment Scheme as part of the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) submitted to the EU Commission for approval last December. The position for Capital Investments under the CSP will remain for renewables to be consumed on the holding only. </p>  <p>  Allowing farmers to generate more renewable energy for their own use and potentially for sale to the grid is a priority of mine. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Minister Eamon Ryan's Department on this given the suite of new measures which that Department has introduced for renewable production this year. I will continue to engage in the revision of the State Aid Regulations as part of this and I will examine all ways to support farmers in this area. </p></reply>

In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of energy poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases.   The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Recognising the unprecedented rise in energy prices facing people the Government has also put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.</p>  <p>  - the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to their accounts.</p>  <p>  - the new National Retrofit Schemes include specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, has also announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:</p>  <p>  - A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  - A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.</p>  <p>  - A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.</p>  <p>  - The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.</p>  <p>  - A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p>  <p>  - An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  - The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, the electricity and gas markets, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to inform policy for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy development in this area. </p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is high international gas prices where we are a price taker. Gas prices are now unprecedently high and these gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.

The Bill provides for a mandatory segregation and incentivised charging regime for commercial waste, similar to what exists for the household market, to ensure waste minimisation and proper segregation in the sector. </p>  <p>  EPA statistics indicate that 70% of the material placed in commercial general waste bin should be in recycling or organic bins.  </p>  <p>  At present, it is possible for commercial premises to dispose of their waste through a single, unsegregated bin.  This will no longer be possible under the changes being introduced by the bill, forcing premises to manage their waste in a properly segregated manner. Addressing this will help us to attain our EU targets for recycling and landfill.</p>  <p>  The Bill is currently before the Oireachtas and it is intended that it will be enacted before the Summer recess. </p>  <p>  My officials will introduce the required secondary legislation to give effect to these measures as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted and will then work with the NWCPO to ensure that all waste collection permits are amended to reflect these new obligations.</p></reply>

I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. </p><p>NBI has advised that as of the end of April 2022 there are currently 5,790 premises passed and available for connection in County Cork.  Further details are available on specific areas within County cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie  .  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas in all 26 counties, including the status of the Deployment Areas located in South-West Cork. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie  .</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 13 May 2022, 581 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork, 23 BCPs are installed to date. Further details can be found at </p><p>In County Cork, 45 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access.

Quarterly or half-yearly renewals impose an additional cost to process and administer. The rate applicable to the half-yearly option is 55.5% of the annual rate, and, for the quarterly option, 28.25% of the annual rate. These ratios have remained generally consistent since the 1960's. The loss of income that would arise from equalising rates for these options would have a negative impact on motor tax revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or in the taxation system generally. The potential loss to the Exchequer has been estimated at just over &euro;37m, based on the volume of transactions in 2021. Given the sum involved, any proposed change is a matter for consideration in the context of Budget preparations.</p></reply>

The Framework provides for a consistent facilitation of remote working across the Civil Service, appropriate to local business needs, while maintaining the Civil Service&rsquo;s position as an employer of choice. This document was published following a thorough and productive engagement with employee representative bodies at a national level. It includes a template on which individual Government Departments can build their own local policies. The current status of progress on tailored, individual policies is for individual Departments to comment on, although in general, the Civil Service as a whole has kept pace on the development of their policies. Within my own Department, a draft local policy has undergone engagement with local staff representatives and is expected to be submitted to the local Management Board for further review at their next meeting. We expect the local policy to launch by the end of June 2022. This is broadly in keeping with the expected timeframe with other Departments. </p>  <p>  I welcomed the publication of the Blended Working Policy Framework at its launch in March which marked the beginning of a new model of working in the Civil Service. The flexibility which blended working affords to both employees and their employers will be essential to the continued delivery of high quality services to Government, the public, and to business.</p>  <p>  The publication and implementation of local policies is also welcomed, as Departments are preparing to introduce more sustainable arrangements for blended working and in a more balanced manner, allowing for face-to-face interaction and collaboration with colleagues, as well as the benefits of a remote working arrangement.</p></reply>

This listing requires member states to manage the species&rsquo; sustainably. The Habitats Directive also requires Ireland to make a detailed report every six years on the conservation status of all listed species, including the Irish hare.</p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2019 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish Hare. The report can be downloaded at www.npws.ie/publications/article-17-reports/article-17-reports-2019  </p>  <p>  The 2019 report notes that the Hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche; it is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The report does highlight some concerns about the loss of habitat quality due to agricultural intensification and afforestation, but overall the species is considered to be in favourable conservation status.</p>  <p>  In addition, the most recent Red Data List for Mammals in Ireland (2019) confirmed that the species is not threatened; it assessed the Irish hare as &ldquo;Least concern&rdquo;</p>  <p> www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/Red%20List%20No.%2012%20Mammals.pdf  </p>  <p>  The most recent national hare survey took place from November 2018 to February 2019. It was commissioned by the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service and involved the extensive deployment of trail cameras providing the data equivalent to 106,026 survey hours.</p>  <p>  The national population was estimated at 223,000 (111,000&ndash;449,000) individual Hares during 2018/19.</p>  <p>  The mean density of Irish Hare was estimated at 3.19 Hares/km2 (95% confidence intervals: 1.59&ndash;6.43) with highest and very comparable densities in the northwest (3.50 Hares/km2 ) and southwest (3.46 Hares/km2 ) regions and lowest density in the east (2.66 Hares/km2 ). The average estimate was 4.5% lower than the 3.33 Hares/km2 estimated during 2006 and 58% lower than the 7.44 Hares/km2 estimated during 2007. Nevertheless, such was the width of the 95% confidence intervals that the 2018/19 density estimate cannot be said to be significantly lower than the previous survey.

The making or amending of differential rent schemes and the calculation of the rent payable is an executive function and is subject to broad principles set out by my Department, including that rent levels should be based on income and reflect tenants&rsquo; ability to pay.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that while local authorities can carry out periodic rent reviews to ensure that the correct rent is applied to an individual tenancy, the tenancy agreements in place between a local authority and its tenants stipulate that it is the tenants&rsquo; responsibility to inform the local authority of any changes in circumstances, including any changes to income, so that the rent payable can be reassessed. Early notification of any income changes can help prevent the accrual of arrears.</p></reply>

In March, 2021 my Department introduced a revised social housing application form, in consultation with the local authority sector, to include an identifier for persons requiring 'wheelchair liveable' accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department is collaborating with the LGMA and the Housing Agency on a project examining, inter alia, how the data captured in the Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) aligns with changes made to the social housing application form, including in respect of a need for  'wheelchair liveable' accommodation. This work will be completed before the 2022 SSHA exercise commences.</p>  <p>  Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Needs Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The HNDA framework also aims to ensure support of independent living for people requiring more specialised types of housing or support needs, including accessible and wheelchair housing.</p>  <p>I launched a new joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027 on 14 January 2022, together with my colleagues  Mr Peter Burke, Minister of State for Local Government and Panning and Ms. Anne Rabbitte, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability (available at gov.ie - National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022 &ndash; 2027 (www.gov.ie)   ) The new Strategy sets out the vision for the cooperation and collaboration of Government Departments, state agencies and others in delivering housing and the related supports for disabled people over the next five years. This new Strategy will operate within the framework of Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland which is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units, is available to everyone in Irish society, including those with disabilities. Preparation of an Implementation Plan for the Strategy is underway with a target for completion by the second quarter of 2022.</p>  <p>A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will prepare Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of their anticipated delivery of social housing over the period 2022-2026 including housing for disabled people.  The  Plans are informed by the targets for social housing delivery contained in Housing for All, and individual targets issued to each local authority in September 2021 for the same period.  They set out details of local authority delivery in addition to other delivery partners, including Approved Housing Bodies. This is the first such multi-annual delivery planning undertaken by the sector and will be an iterative process throughout the 5 years. The plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2 2022.  </p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>If a property is found to be non-compliant with the Regulations, it is a matter for the Local Authority to determine what action is necessary and appropriate, including the issuing of an Improvement Letter, the serving of Improvement Notice and Prohibition Notices, or further legal recourse. </p><p>Under sections 18A and 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a housing authority may serve an Improvement Notice or Prohibition Notice, respectively, where a property is found to be non-compliant. Under Section 34 of that Act, any person who by act or omission contravenes the Regulations, fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, will be guilty of an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.  If the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting is continued after conviction, the person will be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting continues and for each such offence will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;400 per day.  </p><p>To aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations, increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities since 2018 to enable them to build inspection capacity, with payments based on the number of inspections undertaken. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019. However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, pandemic restrictions have greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The number of inspections undertaken in 2020 fell to 25,703 and 20,240 in 2021.</p><p>Housing for All sets a target for the inspection of rental properties, which is 25% of all private residential tenancies. My officials have written to all 31 local authority Chief Executives seeking detailed implementation plans, outlining their plans for 2022 with a clear focus on for example, how they intend to achieve their targets and the approach they plan to take to ensure proper and effective enforcement. If a property has been found to be non-compliant with the regulations, it is a matter for the local authority to determine what action is necessary and appropriate, including the issuing of an improvement letter, the serving of improvement or prohibition notices, or further legal recourse. My Department will work closely throughout the year with the sector to support the achievement of these targets, and ensure effective enforcement. </p><p>The number of private rental inspections undertaken, improvement letters issued and improvement and prohibition notices served in the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and Quarter 1 of 2022 is set out in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total <br /><br />  Rental Inspections Carried Out</th>       <th>Total <br /><br />  Improvement Letters <br /><br />  and Notices</th>       <th>Total <br /><br /> Improvement <br /><br />  Letters <br /><br />  Issued</th>       <th>Total Improvement   Notices <br /><br />  Served</th>       <th>Total <br /><br />  Prohibition <br /><br />  Notices <br /><br />  Served</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>28,464</td>       <td>6,644</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>99</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>17,701</td>       <td>1,911</td>       <td>106</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>25,703</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>15,033</td>       <td>1,578</td>       <td>57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>20,240</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>13,354</td>       <td>813</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 &ndash; Q1</td>       <td>10,632</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>6,575</td>       <td>381</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The electoral register and the process that underpins it has served this country well but we all recognise that it can be improved and modernised to bring about a more straightforward and streamlined process of registration that makes it easier for people to register to vote and update their details. The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits to a series of reforms including the modernisation of the electoral registration process. The Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, includes provisions to modernise the electoral registration process.  The provisions include additional tools for local authorities to update and maintain the register.  These tools, which include the use of PPSNs in the process to facilitate identity data cross checks, combined with a simplified process for individuals to check and update their own information will improve the quality of data on the register and the overall integrity of the process.  An annual report by the proposed Electoral Commission on the status and functioning of the register is also provided for, including any recommendations the Commission considers necessary to maintain or enhance the integrity of the process.</p></reply>

The project is devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.</p>  <p>  At primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for a school&rsquo;s accommodation requirements where an additional teaching post has been sanctioned by Teacher Allocation Section, or a new SEN class has been sanctioned by the National Council for Special Education, and all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for classroom purposes.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade has been on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics and for special education needs provision. However, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at a national level, primary enrolments are projected to decrease significantly over the coming decade, from a peak in 2018.  While there will be local and regional variations, and the impact of Ukrainian arrivals will mitigate this reduction somewhat, there will be strategic opportunities to consider the overall accommodation needs of schools. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the very significant school building programme that is currently underway.  Overall, there are in excess of 1,300 school building projects at various stages of design, planning, and construction. Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work to ensure that capital investment in our schools is targeted in the most efficient and effective way to support schools in meeting the education needs of their students and communities. </p></reply>

The reforms I announced on 29 March include initiatives to spread the assessment load for students and do so in a way that enhances student wellbeing.</p><p>As I set out in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 291 of 4 May 2022, the NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders across a number of phases, including teachers and teacher representative organisations, including teacher unions and subject teacher associations. </p><p>As individual subject specifications are developed there will be further engagement with stakeholders including subject teacher associations. It should also be noted that teachers are represented on the Council of the NCCA and also on the various working and development structures employed by the NCCA. Furthermore, a network school approach will be used in the development of the first tranche of new and revised subject specifications which will also specifically involve teachers. </p></reply>

The engagement has involved reviewing learnings to date and developing agreed arrangements to explore reconfiguration opportunities in these areas as part of a pilot arrangement, as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Arklow</th>       <th>Athlone</th>       <th>Cork*</th>       <th>Dublin*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dundalk</td>       <td>Galway*</td>       <td>Limerick*</td>       <td>Youghal</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*parts of these cities</p><p>To facilitate the pilot, the Department has made available a number of independent facilitators across the pilot areas to work with the school patron and relevant school authorities at a local level:</p><p>- to progress the reconfiguration pilot initiative;</p><p>- to assist in identifying potential school(s) in this regard; and</p><p>- to engage with stakeholders including school authorities, school staff and the school community</p><p>with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is sufficient demand for this in the pilot areas.</p><p>As part of this process, in each area the facilitator appointed by the Department, along with the relevant patron/patron representative will review data on the schools in the area and will engage directly with the relevant school authorities to progress the initiative at a local level. The process will be shaped by the stage (if any) of consideration of reconfiguration in the area concerned and whether any schools have already been identified or have opted-in at this point.</p><p>While the facilitators have commenced their work and are working with the patron representatives in each area as outlined above, the process is at an early stage.  </p><p>The learnings from the process in the pilot areas should provide a pathway forward on the process for providing multi-denominational options for parents in other towns and areas of the country going forward.</p></reply>

In this context I have already reviewed and analysed the disregards in relation to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.</p>  <p>  In this year&rsquo;s Budget, I made significant changes to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test which will take effect in June:</p>  <p>  - The capital/savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment is being increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance. </p>  <p>  - For carers who work, I have increased the weekly income disregard from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner. </p>  <p>  These are the first changes that have been made to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test in 14 years.  </p>  <p>  A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition, the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all family carers providing full time care and assistance regardless of means.  As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Grant from its then current rate of &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850, effective from June 2021.  The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is &euro;262.4 million.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.</p><p>- Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. The rate will vary depending on family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. The maximum available income assessed  subsidy dependent on the aforementioned conditions is &euro;5.10 per hour or a maximum weekly subsidy of &euro;229.50.</p><p>Budget 2022 announced a number of changes to the NCS which will be rolled out this year. The first change removes the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. This came into effect on 2 May 2022. The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children. Full year estimates of these changes have been factored into the costs below but the impact of these changes will not be fully known until Q4 2022.</p><p>The estimated costs based on the scenarios presented are derived from current levels of usage and expenditure adjusted for the Budget 22 changes. These individual estimates are based on no behavioural change and should be interpreted with caution. It should be noted that changes to subsidies may result in changes to patterns and levels of usage by families. These changes are likely to be more pronounced at higher rates of increase.</p><p>Based on the above, the following are the estimated costs and estimated children affected , assuming that the minimum targeted subsidy is increased so as never to be below the universal subsidy:</p><p>- 50 cent - &euro;60 million &ndash; 37,200 children</p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;102 million &ndash; 43,500 children</p><p>- &euro;1.50 - &euro;164 million &ndash; 50,600 children</p><p>- &euro;2 - &euro;212 million (equates to &euro;100 per week at 40 hours per week*)&ndash; 58,300 children</p><p>- &euro;2.50 - &euro;261 million &ndash; 66,700 children</p><p>- &euro;3 - &euro;314 million &ndash; 76,200 children</p><p>- &euro;3.50 - &euro;402 million &ndash; 101,700 children</p><p>- &euro;4 - &euro;466 million &ndash; 116,500 children</p><p>- &euro;4.50 - &euro;526 million &ndash; 119,300 children  </p><p>- &euro;5 - &euro;586 million &ndash; 119,900 children</p><p>*It is assumed that the &euro;20 per week referenced by the Deputy is for an individual using 40 hours universal at .50 per hour.

One of the strands was the appointment of Childminding Advisory Officers, some of whom were employed by the HSE and some by City and County Childcare Committees. Their roles included offering information, support and training to childminders; maintaining the voluntary notification system; and administering other supports for childminders. The Childminding Advisory Officer posts were largely discontinued in 2012-2013 in the context of widespread budget cuts at that time.  </p>  <p>  In 2019 the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth put in place a National Childminding Coordinator, who is located within the Department, along with 6 Childminding Development Officers, who are located within City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) around the country and who have a regional remit. As part of the implementation of Phase 1 of the National Action Plan for Childminding, Budget 2022 enabled the recruitment of an additional 6 Childminding Development Officer posts within the CCCs as well as a national CCC Childminding Lead whose work includes overseeing and coordinating the team of 12 Childminding Development Officers. As the Childminding Development Officers work on a regional basis in collaboration with the CCCs in each region, the team of Childminding Development Officers provides full national coverage.   </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Action Plan for Childminding, the role of the Childminding Development Officers is to prepare the childminding sector for the move towards wider regulation and  support, while also in the immediate term supporting childminders who are subject to the current regulations but are not yet registered with Tusla to meet Tusla registration requirements, thus enabling more childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme and other State supports. </p>  <p>  The full-year cost of the 12 Childminding Development Officer posts that are now in place is &euro;843,000 per annum, which includes costs for salaries, PRSI, travel and subsistence and overheads. </p></reply>

There was also extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation on the issue of addressing disadvantage. The Expert Group was also briefed on the Department of Education&rsquo;s DEIS model.</p>  <p>  As recommended by the Expert Group, once core funding is embedded and changes to existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. </p>  <p>  Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. </p>  <p>  At this early stage of development, it is not possible to meaningfully quantify the cost of such a model for ELC and SAC. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that this will not be a replication or extension of the Department of Education&rsquo;s DEIS model given that the DEIS model is designed as educational disadvantage response in context of primary and post-primary education; although it will be informed by the DEIS approach.</p></reply>

However, the Government decision to commence Direct Provision dates back to 1999. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had responsibility at that time for the international protection process in Ireland and in 2001 set up an internal agency called the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) to administer the Direct Provision system.</p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision of accommodation and related services came about as a result of an increasing number of international protection applicants arriving into the State in 1999. Prior to this, asylum seekers were treated as homeless under the structures then in place. These proved unsuited to the situation facing Ireland in 1999 and subsequent years, when the number of applicants for international protection arriving in Ireland increased significantly. A total of 7,724 applications were received in 1999 and a further 10,938 in the following year. Of these, most presented themselves in Dublin. The homeless service of the then Eastern Health Board could not cope and there was a serious prospect of widespread homelessness among applicants.</p>  <p>  In response, the then Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue T.D., chaired a cross-departmental group to examine the issue. From this, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services (DASS), under the aegis of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was established in November 1999 to co-ordinate the scheme of dispersal and Direct Provision for asylum seekers. DASS was subsequently replaced by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) on 2 April, 2001.  It had as a core principle that applicants would be located in centres across Ireland rather than concentrated in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system did not relate only to the Department of Justice.  It was set up as a whole of Government approach to provide services to arriving International Protection applicants. The Government made a decision that protection applicants could access services, such as health and education, through the existing mainstream services.</p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of any academic research that was carried out at the time of commencement.  Rather, a number of working groups were established to make recommendations on the improvement of the system in subsequent years, notably the 2015 McMahon Working Group and report, and most recently the report of the Catherine Day Advisory Group, which informed the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to ending the current system of Direct Provision and to replace it with a new International Protection policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach. Last year, I published &lsquo;A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service&rsquo;, which sets out how a replacement to the Direct Provision system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.</p></reply>

There are two types of supports available under the Scheme:</p><p>- The Universal Subsidy is available to all families with children under 3 years. It is also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme. </p><p>- The Income Assessed Subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. It is means tested and will be calculated based on individual circumstances. Those on the lowest incomes will receive the highest subsidies. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that as part of Budget 2022, I announced a number of changes to the NCS, which will be of significant benefit to many parents.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-26a.814.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052600078#WRO03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 311 together.</p><p>An Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Childcare in Ireland, undertaken by Crowe in on behalf of my Department, was published in November 2020.  The project was designed to provide a robust evidence base for the further development of high quality Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) in Ireland. </p><p>This Review found that approximately 40% of the total income to the sector comes from parental fees. The remainder came from State funding. This percentage was found to vary significantly across services. Many services rely entirely on State funding while others services rely exclusively on parental fees. In a sustainable service, it is expected that the income to services (from both parental fees and State funding) exceeds the costs of delivering services.</p><p>The income and costs data captured as part of the Review have underpinned the substantial Covid-19 supports secured including the exemption for employers in the ELC and SAC sector to the rule in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) of having to demonstrate the reduction in turnover that was required of other employers.</p><p>Data for this Review was collected prior to the Covid-19 pandemic so the analysis of the breakdown of services' income between State funding and parental fees does not take account of the special financial supports that were made available to the sector from March 2020. </p><p>However, data available through the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey shows that fees have remained largely static since the onset of Covid-19.  At the same time, numbers of children attending services have reduced.  This may rebound as parental working patterns change.  </p><p>My Department is committed to the importance of collecting high quality income and cost data. In 2021, a new supplementary income and costs survey was circulated to all providers alongside the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey, administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department. In 2022, the income and cost survey has been incorporated in to the Sector Profile and I am pleased that 83% of services have already completed this. This up to date sectoral data will provide a strong basis to inform future policy development and investment decisions.</p><p>With regard to State spending in 2020 and 2021, it is important to note that these were distorted years, due to Covid-19 effects.  Expenditure data in relation to the sector from my Department is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Original / Revised Allocation</td>       <td>&euro;590.9* </td>       <td>&euro;637,9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Expenditure </td>       <td>&euro;       507.9m</td>       <td>&euro;         593.5m**</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Notes </td>       <td>*2020 was a revised figure</td>       <td>** It is important to note that 2021 Expenditure figures are provisional and yet   to be finalised</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As we are only partially through 2022, I cannot provide State spending, but can advise that the allocation in Budget 2022 was &euro;716.7 million.  </p><p>This expenditure data does not include, for example, expenditure on the EWSS, which has been available to ELC and SAC employers in the sector between August 2020 and April 2022. The EWSS at enhanced rates (from October 2020-January 2022) equated to &euro;34 million per month for the ELC and SAC sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers.  Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) equated to &euro;22 million per month , covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers, and a flat rate of &euro;100 from March-April  2022, amounting to &euro;11 million per month, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.This expenditure data also excludes the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) that was operated by Revenue in 2020.</p><p>Given the significant distortion that occurred in the sector throughout 2020 and 2021, in terms of both income from fees with reduced attendance of children, and public income, with various exceptional funding arrangements in place, it is not possible to make robust estimates about the split in services&rsquo; income from public and private sources during this time.  </p><p>Core Funding, with a total full year cost equivalent to &euro;221 million, will be of particular interest with regard to the relationship between State investment and parental fees. Core Funding is the new funding stream to start a partnership between the State and providers to support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families. </p><p>Core Funding will introduce a fee freeze for the September 2022-August 2023 programme year. This will stabilise the fee levels and ensure the affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE subsidies are felt by parents, particularly the new extension of the universal NCS payment to all children up to 15. </p><p>Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. I am also aware that this issue is a sector-wide one and does not solely relate to those working in the sector who hold a level 5 award in early learning and care.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early years educators and school age childcare practitioners, my Department does not set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. The cost estimates below would arise for early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) service providers.</p>  <p>  On the basis of 2021 data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile, it can be estimated that the annual cost of raising the wages of all early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners to at least &euro;13 per hour would be approximately &euro;26.2 million. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of other employer costs is estimated to be approximately &euro;5 million, bringing the total cost to &euro;31.1 million.</p>  <p>  In relation to the estimates above, the following should be noted:</p>  <p>  - The cost estimate only relates to staff who recorded an hourly wage in their response to the 2020/21 Annual Early Years Sector Profile. It does not include any costs that might arise to adjust wages for those who instead report an annual salary or draw profits as owner-managers.</p>  <p>  - The cost estimate only relates to staff and managers who work directly with children. It does not include wages for managers who do not work directly with children or wages of ancillary staff.</p>  <p>  - The cost estimate is not limited to those staff and managers whose highest level of qualification is Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications. It includes the cost of raising the wages of staff with higher qualifications who earn less than &euro;13 per hour.</p>  <p>  - The cost estimate is the additional cost of bringing staff from their current wage up to at least &euro;13 per hour. </p>  <p>  - The cost estimate does not attempt to look at the potential cost implications for the wages of staff currently earning more than &euro;13 per hour.</p>  <p>  - The methodology used in estimating the above costs is based on analysis of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile data and differs from the allocation mechanism for Core Funding, which is based on a service's capacity and not on a service&rsquo;s individual staff wage rates. </p></reply>

The brief for the Review included:</p>  <p>  - analysing the current costs of providing ELC and the factors that impact on these costs;</p>  <p>  - the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing ELC that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and</p>  <p>  - providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the ELC sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.</p>  <p>  The project has provided a robust evidence base for the development of policy and implementation of initiatives to support the delivery of high quality ELC in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The final report, Independent Review of the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare Services in Ireland, was published in 2020. The draft final report, cost modelling tool and guidance were subject to peer review. </p>  <p>  As part of the Review, the broad components of the full cost of delivering ELC was identified. This suggested a pattern consistent with those found in other jurisdictions, including England, New Zealand and Scotland, whereby a dominance of staff costs in the make-up of the overall cost figures. Specifically, on average, staffing costs were found to account for approximately 70% of the total cost of delivering ELC across all services. Whilst the average proportion of total cost represented by staffing costs varies marginally, it is at a minimum, more than two-thirds of the total cost of delivering ELC, regardless of different provider types. </p>  <p>  These figures relate to providers' total costs, regardless of the extent to which those costs are subsidised by public funding.  Separately, the same review found that, on average 60% of the income to the sector is from public funding although this varies substantially across the sector. </p>  <p>  Data on provider income and cost was also collected in 2021 and 2022 by Pobal to enable similar analysis.  Analysis of data collected in 2021 shows broad consistency with 2018 data in relation to the proportion of costs driven by staff costs. </p>  <p>  Income and cost data, now collected through the Sector Profile, is more important than ever to underpin important policy and funding decisions. A new round of data collection has recently been completed.  This is opportune given the uniqueness of this point in time for the sector with the end of pandemic measures and imminent introduction of the major new funding stream, Core Funding.  I am delighted that 83% of services have already completed the Sector Profile this year, which will provide a strong basis to inform future policy development and assess the impact of Core Funding. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to announced Core Funding, a new supply-side funding stream available to ELC providers from September 2022.  Core Funding amounts to &euro;221 million in full year costs (&euro;173 million of which is new investment).  The &euro;221 million Core Funding budget is distributed to services in a fair and proportionate manner, based primarily on the features that determine services&rsquo; operating costs, key of which is staff costs.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, Core Funding and this significant increase in investment to the sector is the vehicle through which the Government will deliver improved pay and conditions for staff through supporting the drawing up of Employment Regulation Order for different roles of the sector by the Joint Labour Committee and through introduction new mechanisms to control parental fees.  </p></reply>

An award letter was sent on that day 28th April 2020 advising she had been awarded Postgraduate Tuition Fees to a maximum of &euro;6,270 and the special adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The application was reviewed as part of a Post-Award Review on 15th October 2020 and a further award letter confirming she had been awarded Postgraduate Tuition Fees to a maximum of &euro;6,270 and the special adjacent rate of maintenance grant was sent on 19th October 2020. </p>  <p>  An internal review request was received regarding this application on 19th October 2020 regarding the adjacency rate awarded.</p>  <p>  The assessment team in SUSI investigated this placement and based on information from the college&rsquo;s website the placement is for two days a in SUSI week on placement and the rest of the week is on campus. Therefore, as the placement is not for a period of at least one semester off-campus the adjacency rate cannot change as more time is spent on campus than off campus. The applicant was advised of this by telephone on 26 October 2021. The Internal Review Team issued the following determination. &ldquo;As the placement/course is split throughout the week as stated on the college website, the placement is not full time and therefore will not affect adjacency.&rdquo; The student further contacted SUSI on 30th August 2021 to query why she had not been awarded the non-adjacent rate of maintenance. Her application was reviewed and a letter to advise her that there had been no change to the original decision to award her the adjacent rate of grant was sent to her on 2nd September 2021. SUSI received a Notice of Appeal regarding adjacency for the 2020/2021 academic year on 17th December 2021 and a letter was sent to the applicant on 22nd December 2021 advising that the appeal could not be accepted as it was received outside the maximum 60-day timeframe.</p>  <p>  The applicant contacted the Support Desk in SUSI to enquire when the original decision was made and how the 60 days were calculated. The student was advised date of the decision to award her the adjacent rate of grant was 19 October 2020 and the 60 days started then. This would mean the 60-day window to appeal closed on 18 December 2020. As the appeal was received 12 months after this date it could not be considered by the Appeals Officer. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). My officials have also been informed that the student in question submitted an appeal to the Student Grant Appeals Board in January 2022 however, this could not be heard as an appeal by the Board as the student never submitted an appeal to the SUSI Appeals Officer as per the process outlined above. I would encourage the Deputy to make contact directly with SUSI if she has any additional questions.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE in Covid-19 exposed frontline settings; </p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>Section 39 employees in the particular organisations listed above are eligible for the payment. I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. </p><p>In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

Extending the programme to those up to the age 69 was a Programme for Government commitment which I am pleased to note has been met and is now being implemented. The Programme for Government also commits to extending the age range for BowelScreen, which currently invites people aged 60 to 69, to those aged 55 to 74, and the HSE is planning to begin this expansion.</p><p>Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, such as further widening the age eligibility range, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. </p><p>The NSAC held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; in 2021, which gave the public an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or changes to existing ones.  I am pleased to inform that the Committee have already considered some of the proposals that it received at its meeting in February 2022, including those relating to the existing national cancer screening programmes and made a number of decisions.</p><p>Following submissions received from several sources, including from BreastCheck, the Committee has decided to ask HIQA to look at the evidence to further extend the age ranges for breast screening.</p><p>The Committee has also decided to ask HIQA to look at further extending the age range for bowel screening, beyond that already committed to.</p><p>I look forward to updating you further as the work progresses, while acknowledging that these processes can take time to undertake a thorough evaluation of the evidence and the potential benefits and costs. However, these recent NSAC decisions are an important step in progressing our policy on cancer screening with a view to further improving the outcomes for our population.</p><p>It is important to remind that screening is for healthy people without symptoms, and I would advise anyone to take up their invitation for screening when they receive it.  If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p></reply>

Services are provided by private dentists who hold a contract with the HSE. Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, I gave approval on the 13<sup>th</sup>of April, for the implementation of new measures to provide for both expanded dental health care for medical card holders and increased fees for dental contractors in the hope that more dentists will see more medical card patients.</p><p>The changes to the Scheme came into effect from the beginning of May 2022.</p><p>These changes to the Scheme are interim measures designed to secure services for medical card holders pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy.

It also surveys people&rsquo;s attitudes and perceptions relating to tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use and records the impact of drug use on communities. The 2019&ndash;2020 NDAS, published by the Health research Board in July 2021, collected information from 5,762 people aged 15 years and older across Ireland and can be found at the following  link: www.drugsandalcohol.ie/34287/</p>  <p>  The findings of the survey show that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014/15 survey, while an increase was seen in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. Cannabis is still the most prevalent illegal drug used in Ireland, but has also shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded. The HRB is current analysing the survey data by CHO and the results will be published in the coming months.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I announced a &euro;2 million community services enhancement fund to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services. The aim of the fund is to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community, which is a strategic priority for the national drugs strategy 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  I have allocated between &euro;200,000 and &euro;240,000 per annum to the nine community healthcare organisations (CHOs). The funding will be allocated on a three-year cycle, with ongoing monitoring and evaluation, to ensure that services are effective in addressing the needs of people who use drugs and alcohol. Twenty-five percent of the funding allocations is ring-fenced to increase access to and the provision of drug and alcohol services for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  Profiling the drug and alcohol needs of the population across the CHOs, including data from the NDAS, will enable the development of new services and the measurement of their impact over time. Already, we are seeing new drug and alcohol needs emerge, whether in the night-time economy, among young people, in disadvantaged communities, or polydrug use. </p>  <p>  I believe that drug and alcohol services should be provided based on population needs, as this is both equitable and evidence-based. I also want services to be delivered in the community so that health care is closer to people&rsquo;s homes, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme. By integrating drug and alcohol services as part of community care, the health needs of people who use drugs can be better met and the stigma of drug and alcohol use can be reduced. These are practical steps to strengthen the health-led response to drug and alcohol use.</p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;850,000 for an initiative to reduce the health-related harms from cocaine and crack cocaine. This initiative will target disadvantaged communities that are worst affected by cocaine and crack cocaine and contribute to a whole of government response to the social determinants and consequences of drug use in these communities.</p>  <p>  Drug use seriously impacts all parts of society, and I am committed to the implementation of the health led approach and to supporting people on their journey to recovery.</p></reply>

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Currently there are 2,549 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme.</p>  <p>  Where a GP GMS vacancy is set to arise in a practice, the HSE is notified in advance and becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. As of the 1st of May 2022, there are 35 GMS vacancies across the country, just over 1 percent of the total number of GMS panels; there are no GP GMS vacancies in Co. Kildare. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reform and service development will see the Government increase annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. These changes and others make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. Responsibility for training has transferred last year from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners and an intake of 258 trainees is planned for this year, with further increases expected for future years.</p>  <p>  The measures undertaken will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

It takes a life course approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age. The Strategy has been extended to the end of 2022, in order to account for the various impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on previous timelines. </p><p>Current priority deliverables under the Strategy are HIV prevention, including the continued expansion of a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme, which commenced in late 2019, and the HIV Fast Track Cities programme, involving Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge; expanding sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.</p><p>A review of the Strategy began in 2021, having been postponed as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) team, those working in STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community.</p><p>The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. An external review of the Strategy has been approved and is currently being commissioned through standard procurement processes. It is envisaged that the procurement process will conclude by July, with the Review to take 3-4 months once commenced. When complete, the Report will be published on the Healthy Ireland website. Results will, in turn, inform future policy direction and the Women's Health Taskforce will continue to provide input as the policy is implemented. </p><p>Following the completion of the Review, and taking into account its recommendations, drafting of a renewed National Sexual Health Strategy will commence. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).   They use a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to protracted commercial engagements.</p>  <p>  When there is a proposed decision by the HSE not to support reimbursement of a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline.  This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to the HSE to reconsider their decision. The HSE must then consider those representations and make a formal decision.</p>  <p>  The current process for assessing applications works very well where new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, are priced in a cost-effective manner.  </p>  <p>  The principal factors in determining the speed of reimbursement are the price at which a manufacturer applies for the reimbursement of a product, the availability of Exchequer funding, and the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s rigorous assessment process as to its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Unviable initial pricing presented by Industry often results in substantive time engaged in commercial negotiations to achieve reduced pricing.</p>  <p>  The budget allocation of &euro;50m funding for new medicines in Budget 2021 provided for the reimbursement of 52 new medicines/new indications of existing medicines. A further &euro;30 was allocated in Budget 2022. To date in 2022 the HSE has approved at least 24 new medicines/new indications of existing medicines.</p></reply>

Individuals who are vulnerable to COVID-19 are further advised to be aware of the risk associated with activities they may choose to engage in and to take measures to optimally protect themselves. Vulnerable individuals are advised to consider wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, such as social gatherings or other activities and events.</p>  <p>  It is important to provide clear guidance and communication to the public on the evolving disease profile and a cultural shift towards embedding individual and collective personal behaviours to mitigate against COVID-19.

In February of this year, I launched the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, following extensive consultation between my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. With this Plan, &euro;350 million has been allocated to the HSE and NTPF to provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and times and bring forward much needed longer-term reform. </p>  <p>  It is projected that 1.5 million people will be added to waiting lists this year. The Plan details how we intend to ensure that an even higher number, 1.7 million, are treated and removed from waiting lists. Therefore, if this Plan is fully delivered, it will reduce waiting lists by 18 percent this year which will bring the number of people waiting to 588,000, the lowest number in five years. </p>  <p>  The Plan will also progress work towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the National Service Plan (of 18 months for OPD; 12 months for IPDC; and 12 months for GI scopes).</p>  <p>  Additionally, there is a particular focus on 15 high-volume inpatient day case procedures, so that every person waiting for over 6 months who is clinically ready will receive an offer of treatment. These procedures include cataracts, hip and knee replacements, and angiograms. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Plan is well underway, with progress being monitored by a Task Force co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The NTPF have advised my Department that to date this year they have approved orthopaedic outpatient and in-patient initiatives which will facilitate appointments for 11,287 patients on waiting lists. Details of these initiatives are provided in the attached document.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the total number of patients currently seeking orthopaedic interventionism has been provided to my Department by the NTPF and is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>Orthopaedics, In-patient Daycase (IPDC) Waiting List, as at 28/04/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time band (months)</th>       <th>0-6 Mths</th>       <th>6-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-18 Mths</th>       <th>18+ Mths</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr-22</td>       <td>6,890</td>       <td>1,974</td>       <td>884</td>       <td>1,744</td>       <td>11,492</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Orthopaedics, Outpatient (OPD) Waiting List, as at 28/04/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time band (months)</th>       <th>0-6Months</th>       <th>6-12Months</th>       <th>12-18Months</th>       <th>18+Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr-22</td>       <td>29,899</td>       <td>19,197</td>       <td>10,050</td>       <td>12,613</td>       <td>71,759</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Orthopaedics, Outpatient (OPD) Waiting List, as at 28/04/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time band (months)</th>       <th>0-6Months</th>       <th>6-12Months</th>       <th>12-18Months</th>       <th>18+Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr-22</td>       <td>29,899</td>       <td>19,197</td>       <td>10,050</td>       <td>12,613</td>       <td>71,759</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>NTPF Insourcing Approved OPD Orthopaedic Proposals to date 24/05/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Hospital</th>       <th>Volume</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St James's Hospital</td>       <td>920</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital</td>       <td>343</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St Vincent's University Hospital</td>       <td>2,160</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>1,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Waterford</td>       <td>1,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Croom Hospital</td>       <td>2,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>8,423</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>NTPF Insourcing Approved IPDC Orthopaedic Proposals to date 24/05/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Hospital</th>       <th>Volume</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny University Hospital</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Croom Hospital</td>       <td>1,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Beaumont Hospital</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Galway</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh</td>       <td>219</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilcreene Hospital</td>       <td>1,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St Vincent's University Hospital</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>2,864</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This is the second three-year strategy that aims to realise the vision of a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay. The Strategy focusses on two Reform Programmes, with eleven projects, for 2021 &mdash; 2023: <i>Improving Safe, Timely Access to Care; and Promoting Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing and Addressing Health Inequalities. </i>A mid-year progress report was published in September 2021 and an end-of-year Progress Report was published in February this year.</p><p>Implementation continued despite the challenges of the major cyber-attack on our health services and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Substantial key achievements last year and this year to date include approval of the Government&rsquo;s National Elective Ambulatory Strategy and progressing plans for new elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin; publication of the Business Case for Regional Health Areas to support the alignment of community and hospital services based on defined population need; and mainstreaming innovation through the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund.</p><p>New governance structures have been put in place, including the new Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Board, co-chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department of Health and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, to ensure that implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is fully embedded and owned across the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>Work is being finalized on a detailed 2022 Action Plan in order continue to deliver on our Sl&aacute;intecare commitments this year and this will be published in the near future. Key areas of focus this year will include addressing waiting lists, further developments in shifting care to the Community, further investment in innovation, enhanced capacity and access to care, implementing digital and eHealth solutions in line with Government&rsquo;s recently published national digital framework &ldquo;Harnessing Digital&rdquo;, introducing the Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant Contract, progressing the National Elective Ambulatory Strategy through the provision of new elective capacity in Cork, Dublin and Galway, and the realignment of acute and community services via Regional Health Areas.</p></reply>

The most recent survey, coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was conducted in 2020. The surveys are undertaken to help civil service employers to understand and build on the strengths and talents of the people who work in the civil service and to identify any challenges to inform any required actions to address those challenges.</p><p>The 2020 results for the Department of Health are consistent, in general terms, with the results for the wider civil service.For the Department of Health the 2020 results indicate a positive, upward trend in most themes compared to previous surveys and reflect the impact of departmental initiatives that have taken place since 2015.  Survey measures such as involvement and innovation climate, leadership and performance standards are factors which have been shown to influence the retention of staff.  These measures have seen improvements since the first survey was undertaken in 2015 and the Department is continuing to focus on these areas for further development through various initiatives. </p><p>Current projects and initiatives include a Culture Project, the development and introduction of a Blended Working Policy, health and wellbeing supports, learning and development opportunities, promotional opportunities and increasing engagement with staff through various networks, the encouragement of social activities and most recently, the establishment of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion working group.</p><p>The Department manages its workforce planning via its governance structures and the availability and retention of staff is a matter of ongoing focus for the Department's senior management.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out of hours co-operatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services facilitate the provision of GP services outside of normal surgery hours and help to spread the burden of this provision. Only a small number of areas are not covered by GP out of hours co-operatives, instead out of hours services are provided by local GPs.</p>  <p>  The HSE is in regular contact with out of hours service providers. In particular, over the past two years there has been greater engagement to ensure that the services can continue to provide the supports needed by local communities. In recognition of the key role GP out of hours service providers play in the delivery of our health service and the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, a financial and service stability arrangement for GP Out of Hours cooperatives was introduced with effect from 14th March 2020. </p>  <p>  GP out of hours cooperatives are private organisations. The HSE provides significant funding to support out of hours co-operative services through service level agreements; the HSE has responsibility for determining the allocation of funding from its budget. As the provision of out of hour GP services is a service, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in relation to regional GP out of hours service levels, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for this area I have prioritised home support services so that additional funding secured in Budget 2021, to provide an extra 5 million hours, has been maintained under Budget 2022. In 2021 some 20.4 million hours were provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%. </p>  <p>  It takes some time between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours, and certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability.  Preliminary activity data shows that at the end of March 2022 over 5.1 million home support hours were delivered nationally to 55,080 people. Also, as of this date, there were 286 people assessed and waiting for funding for new or additional home support, while 5,458 people were assessed and approved for Home Support but are awaiting a carer to be assigned.  As of 17 May, the HSE reported 90 patients nationally who are waiting to be discharged with home support.   </p>  <p>  The demand for home support and its importance as an alternative to long stay care has grown considerably over the past number of years.  Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment. This has been affected due to the strategic workforce challenges in the home support sector.  The HSE is endeavouring to prioritise service for clients with the highest care needs, to ensure that the service can commence for those who require it most urgently.  The HSE continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for Health Care Support Assistants and to recruit as many suitable candidates as possible.  Due to the nature of the role, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level.   </p>  <p>  I am very aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector, and I have held multiple meetings with relevant key stakeholders in recent months on these matters.  I have established a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.  The Group provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector nationwide. Later this year the Group will provide me with a set of recommendations based on its key findings, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations.</p></reply>

One of the central priorities for me as Minister for Health is that waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures are improved, and that children receive the care that they need and deserve in a timely and appropriate fashion. In particular, a special area of focus for me and my Department is that of paediatric orthopaedics.</p>  <p>  In January I asked the HSE to develop a dedicated plan to tackle scoliosis waiting lists this year. In February I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss the finalisation of the proposals to increase orthopaedic activity at CHI. The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs. Plans are currently being finalised by CHI in this regard.</p></reply>

This designation is for medicines developed for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases that are life-threatening or very serious. The European Commission decides whether to grant an orphan designation for the medicine based on the COMP's opinion. The application process for this designation takes a maximum of 90 days from validation.</p>  <p>  In the EU, medicines for rare diseases must be authorised by the European Commission under the &lsquo;centralised procedure&rsquo;. It is therefore not open to Irish authorities to grant a marketing authorisation for orphan medicines outside of this framework. Evaluating a marketing-authorisation application under the centralised procedure can take up to 210 days, not counting clock stops when applicants have to provide additional information. It is possible for an orphan medicine sponsor to submit an application through an accelerated assessment procedure. This procedure reduces the timeframe for the EMA to review the marketing-authorisation application to 150 days, not including any clock stops. It will then be up to the sponsor company to respond promptly to requests for additional information or data to support its application to avoid extended clock stops.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act. </p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need.</p>  <p>  The pipeline of new medicines coming to market remains strong and this government wants to secure fast access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients, including those for the treatment of rare diseases. The principal factors determining the speed of reimbursement are the price at which a manufacturer applies for the reimbursement of a product, the availability of Exchequer funding, and the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s rigorous assessment process as to its clinical and cost-effectiveness.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and 19 of the 52 new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals.</p>  <p>  The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan new medicines this year.</p>  <p>  The HSE does not maintain a register of which medicines are designated orphan drugs, as the orphan status for a drug is subject to change at European level. However, the HSE anticipates that a number of medicines with orphan status are likely to be approved throughout 2022.</p></reply>

This centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  The roll out of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care began in 2020, and at present, 9 of these clinics are operational. This includes the new clinics at the Rotunda, Cork, Galway, Letterkenny, Waterford, and Nenagh which are all operational, as well as the expansion of pre-existing ambulatory gynaecology clinics at the Coombe, National Maternity Hospital (NMH), and Mayo. Work is continuing in relation to recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of the remaining ambulatory gynaecology clinics that were funded in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Building on progress to-date, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics at the last six hospital sites. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally. </p>  <p>  With particular reference to endometriosis, as part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there had previously been no ready access in Ireland. Building on that work, funding has been provided under Budget 2022, which will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital. </p>  <p>  In addition, in April 2022, I announced funding through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund for six additional interdisciplinary teams to support holistic treatment of endometriosis within each of the hospital networks.</p>  <p>  With regard to menopause, the first of the dedicated specialist menopause clinics opened in the NMH last year. Budget 2022 funding will facilitate the establishment of three additional such clinics, to be located in Cork, Galway and Limerick, as part of the maternity networks in the South-South West, University of Limerick, and Saolta Hospital Groups. </p>  <p>  In addition, in April 2022, I announced funding through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund for two further specialist menopause clinics to fully support the eastern seaboard and ensure that there is one such clinic in each maternity network. This will support equity of access for women across Ireland and bring the total number of clinics nationally to six.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. </p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.</p>  <p>  Based on information provided by companies involved in the recent HRT shortages, we now appear to have entered a stabilisation period in supply. During this stabilisation, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. Following a meeting with key stakeholders involved in the supply of HRT products to the Irish market it was agreed to establish a multistakeholder group to closely monitor the supply of HRT until the issue is fully resolved. </p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In 2018 and 2019, HIQA undertook a monitoring programme of all 19 maternity units/hospitals, against the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services. Assessment of services undertaken during the monitoring programme focused on four specific themes within the national standards:</p>  <p>  -  leadership, governance and management;</p>  <p>  -  workforce;</p>  <p>  -  effective care and support; and</p>  <p>  -  safe care and support.</p>  <p>  In 2020, HIQA published an individual report into services at each unit/hospital, along with an overview report into maternity services nationally. That report is largely positive and the finding of high levels of compliance against most of the Standards assessed during the monitoring programme, is particularly welcome. Importantly however, the report identifies a number of areas where work is required to meet the standards. The HSE has done significant work to address the findings of the report to date, including revising its Implementation Plan for the National Maternity Strategy, in the roll out of the Strategy&rsquo;s model of care and in improved governance of maternity services. </p>  <p>  In addition, funding for the development of maternity services has increased significantly, with a total of almost &euro;16 million allocated specifically for the implementation of the Strategy under Budgets 2021 and 2022. This funding is further improving access to specialist services, including obstetric, endocrinology, perinatal pathology, neonatology, and perineal services, as well as further developing community-based midwifery services. It is also supporting the recruitment of additional WTEs into maternity services across the country, including Consultants, Midwifery/Nursing posts, Allied Health workers, Healthcare Assistants and Administrative staff. In line with HIQA's recommendations, this investment is delivering increased choice to women, as well as improving outcomes and experiences for women and babies accessing maternity services.</p></reply>

This work is being undertaken with the support of the Directorate-General for Structure Reform Support (DG Reform of the EU Commission) under the auspices of their Technical Support Instrument (TSI) to provide the technical expertise to deliver on this ambitious project. The project will take 20 months to complete.</p>  <p>  AARC Ltd are partnering with Indecon Consultants to deliver the project. Work on the project is progressing and the Department is working with the project team from Indecon Consultants, AARC Consulting and the European Commission to deliver this important work.  The Objective of this project is the development of scenario-based projections of health and social care workforce supply and demand which informs a strategy, action plan and set of recommendations for ongoing strategic health and social care workforce planning.  The project will provide the necessary tools, processes, and technical capacity to produce rolling health and social care workforce planning action plans and implement targeted policy measures for health and social care workforce reform. </p>  <p>  Medical workforce planning and supply and demand analysis is conducted by the National Doctors Training and Planning (NDTP) Office in HSE. The work of this office addresses future projections for the appropriate staffing of the medical workforce in Ireland. The NDTP Office have published a number of reports to inform long term needs of the medical workforce, this includes the report &lsquo;Demand for Medical Consultants and Specialists to 2028 and the Training Pipeline to Meet Demand - National Doctors Training and Planning (NDTP)&rsquo;. This work informs the actions required to meet the need for adequately trained doctors in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Department of Health officials engage on an ongoing basis with colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that we train enough graduates with the skills necessary to support the delivery of health and social care services and to develop a strategic approach to workforce planning for the health sector. </p>  <p>  Ongoing discussions between both Departments are in relation to increasing domestic supply of health and Social Care graduates in the short term, through the immediate provision of additional places, and the longer-term planning being undertaken around future skills needs in context of future demand for health and social care services. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-26a.1113.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022052600083#WRT00400"><p>The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  My Department has no role in regard to prosecutions.</p>  <p>  Wildfire activity for 2022 is significantly reduced in comparison to recent years and current burned area is estimated at just over 2500ha. In recent years average burned area is approximately 3800ha. The recent reduction is considered to be a result of reduced levels of agricultural burning observed during this season, coupled with meteorological factors influencing fire risk. The majority of land affected during 2022 to date is not farmland or used for agricultural purposes.</p>  <p>  Wildfire is an easily preventable threat to our beautiful hills and bogs and the habitats and livelihoods they sustain. Everyone must play their part in protecting our landscapes and supporting our emergency services and ensuring they are not needlessly diverted by illegal fires.</p>  <p>  There is a inherent natural risk of fire in our uplands and on bogs at this time of year, due to the condition of vegetation in these area. Upland grasses, heather and gorse are highly flammable in spring when the weather is dry.  </p>  <p>  In the right conditions, any ignition, for any reason, can give rise to wildfires. Both landowners and the wider public, whether they are at work or enjoying the countryside, should be mindful of the significant risks of fire at this time of year and be aware of the damage to land and habitats caused by illegal burning and other accidental and unintentional ignitions.  </p>  <p>  My Department conducts a number of activities annually to monitor and reduce wildfire incidence and outcomes.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued reminders to all landowners in relation to illegal burning of agricultural lands, and any land found to have been burned illegally can be deemed ineligible across a number of area-based schemes.  My Department also monitors fire activity and risk throughout the main risk period between March and September, using a variety of means at our disposal, including satellite detection and ground inspections.</p>  <p>  My Department has also undertaken a number of awareness measures aimed at reducing the level of illegal ignitions, particularly on farmland, and in ensuring that affected sectors are fully prepared for fire outbreaks where these occur. This includes the provision of Fire Danger Rating Notices to relevant sectors and Departments to ensure that the correct level of preparedness is maintained throughout the fire season. My Department also encourages the safe use of fire by land managers during the open burning season, and provides guidance for doing so.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that wildfire ignitions occur from a variety of sources, not just agriculture, and many recent fires have occurred on lands with no associated agricultural activity, including lands used for turf cutting, and public lands with open access used by the public for recreation. Fires associated with illegal dumping on bogland are a particular problem. In 2020, some of the largest and most problematic fires occurred as a result of recreational land user activities.</p>  <p>  The farming community has a central role to play in the control of fire in our landscapes through the management of land, and the reduction and maintenance of fire prone vegetation (such purple moor grass, heather, and gorse/whin) as potential fuels in high fire risk areas. </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department supports a number of locally-led schemes under the EIP-AGRI measure that in turn support the implementation of fire management activities on the ground including vegetation management activities. Projects of this type are now in place in many of the main fire risk locations in Ireland, including the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, McGillicuddy Reeks, Inishowen Peninsula, Connemara, and within the Hen Harrier Project.</p>  <p>  The Hen Harrier project is a results-based project, supported by my Department, covering key habitats across a number of different counties. The project  has recently developed and implemented a number of specific fire management measures including upland grazing management and support, the development of ponds in high risk areas that can provide water for aerial fire fighting operations, and the safe use of fire as a land management tool by landowners. The project also liaises directly with relevant local fire services in areas where it operates. </p>  <p>  All of the upland projects involve fire management education and awareness building activities directly with landowners through project agricultural advisors and direct inputs from local fire and rescue services and experts from my Department and Teagasc.</p>  <p>  My Department activated its Fire Danger Rating System back in March of this year for the fire season ahead and to date four such Fire Danger Notices notices have been issued, ahead of risk weather phases.   </p>  <p>  I advise Forest owners and managers to check and update their fire plans and other relevant contingencies such as insurance, firebreaks, access and water points, and private helicopter contracts etc., so as to be prepared well in advance of high fire risk phases. Rural dwellers should also assess wildfire risks to their homes and properties and prepare accordingly. Guidance for this is available from the Office of Emergency Planning &ldquo;Be Summer Ready&rdquo; awareness campaign www.gov.ie/summerready.</p>  <p>  There has been a very significant increase in the use of outdoor amenities and recreation sites by the public since the onset of COVID-19. This is a very welcome development, however forest visitors are reminded not to light fires or use barbeques, to behave responsibly, observe relevant local bye-laws, observe correct physical distancing practice and to park considerately so as not to impede access of emergency vehicles to incidents.</p>  <p>  There is a very firm link in recent years between serious wildfire ignitions and illegal dumping and burning of domestic waste in many areas, and malicious burning at forest amenity sites and turf bogs open to the public. </p>  <p>  My Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda Siochana, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112/999 service. We all have our part to play in protecting our countryside from uncontrolled fires.</p>  <p>  Fire warnings can be accessed at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/642e6-forestry/ and www.teagasc.ie/crops/forestry/forest-fire-risk/.</p></reply>

Information regarding the Enforcement Authority can be found on the Authority's website at www.utp.gov.ie.  Suppliers can submit complaints in confidence online through the same website.</p>  <p>  The Enforcement Authority has taken a proactive approach to enforcement that includes an ongoing  awareness raising campaign, meetings with stakeholders throughout the supply chain, as well as targeted engagement with the largest buyers of agri-food products in the State to ensure compliance with the Directive.  I was delighted to attend and speak at the recent Breakfast Seminar organised by the Enforcement Authority to mark the first anniversary of the signing of the UTP Regulations. </p>  <p>  You might be aware that the Enforcement Authority carried out significant engagement with supplier businesses and primary producers as part of market research surveys to establish baseline awareness and knowledge of the protections available to suppliers under the UTP Regulations and to hear about any UTP-related issues that suppliers encounter in business dealings with their buyers.  </p>  <p>  While the survey found that only 14% of primary producers surveyed were aware that, as a supplier of agri-food product, they have legal protection against the 16 specific unfair trading practices, one in two of primary producers and business-to-business suppliers surveyed claim to have heard of the UTP Regulations and half of primary producers surveyed claim that they understand that the UTP Regulations protect against unfair trading practices. </p>  <p>  The survey findings highlight the need to reinforce the message that protection is available for farmers along with other small business suppliers.  The findings also provide a strong evidence base for the Enforcement Authority to more optimally target its resources in the areas of most concern from a supplier perspective.  </p>  <p>  In regard to future arrangements for the enforcement of UTPs, following Government approval of a General Scheme of the Agricultural and Food Supply Chain Bill 2022 on 22nd March last, I am hopeful that the legal drafting will be finalised in the next few weeks and that the Bill can be presented for consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the very near future. As the Deputy may be aware, this Bill will establish the Office for Fairness and Transparency in the Agri-Food Supply chain as a new independent, statutory body and will take over enforcement of the UTP Directive. </p></reply>

The sector must reduce emissions by between 22-30%, to bring emissions from a baseline of 23MT CO2 eq into a range of 16 and 18MT CO2 eq by 2030.  A more precise emissions reduction target within this range is likely to emerge over the short term as a sectoral emissions ceiling is set for the sector. </p>  <p>  My position has been consistent on this matter, agriculture will indeed need to step up its climate ambitions, like all sectors, in order to ensure that the economy wide reduction of a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 is achieved.  </p>  <p>  However, agriculture is not unique in this regard as a climate change is a challenge for everyone in society. The sector must find ways to reduce emissions while not compromising our ability to produce feed and food. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action plan sets out the sort of measures the sector will need to take in order to transition to a more long term sustainable platform with co-benefits for water, air quality and biodiversity, while at all times, maintaining productivity in the sector. </p>  <p>  I recently established a Food Vision 2030 dairy group, and they are about to submit their initial report, which will identify ways to stabilize and reduce emissions from the dairy sector. A similar group for beef and sheep will soon be established. </p>  <p>  The advisory network in Ireland will play a key role in driving change at farm level. I am confident that by taking appropriate action on every farm in the country, we can maintain our grass based livestock production system, and continue to export our world class food products all over the globe. </p></reply>

The sector must reduce emissions by between 22-30%, to bring emissions from a baseline of 23MT CO2 eq into a range of 16 and 18MT CO2 eq by 2030.  A more precise emissions reduction target within this range is likely to emerge over the short term as a sectoral emissions ceiling is set for the sector. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets out a range of measures the sector will need to adopt. These  measures which will deliver a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions abatement of approximately 3.7-4.2MT were published in the Climate Action Plan. Clearly this still leaves a gap to target, which will need to bridged by new technologies underpinned by research and innovation.  </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage internationally on research and innovation. We maintain our role as co-chair of the livestock sub-group of the Global Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. I recently committed Ireland to joining the global climate initiative, Agricultural Innovation Mission (AIM) for climate. This initiative requires global partners to increase research investment in climate smart agriculture. My Department and Teagasc also work very closely with New Zealand in the areas of methane and nitrous oxide. New Zealand shares similar challenges to us in terms of reducing GHG emissions from their pasture based livestock agri sector. </p>  <p>  I have been consistent in my message that agriculture must contribute to the national efforts to reduce GHG emissions, while at the same time maintaining food production from our pasture based livestock production system. Research and innovation will play a key role in achieving this objective over the course of the decade. </p></reply>

The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. I am acutely aware of the challenges pig farmers are facing at present. I also acknowledge the role of Minister of State Martin Heydon in his role as chair of the Pig Roundtable. </p>  <p>  In March, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. Farmers were able to receive a payment of up to &euro;20,000 per farmer. Over 80% of applications have since been processed for payment. The remaining applications are currently being processed.</p>  <p>  On 13th April, I announced the Government's approval for exceptional aid supports of &euro;15.8 million for the pig and horticulture sector, which will be funded from Ireland's envelope of EU exceptional adjustment aid under Commission delegated regulation 2022/467. The approval was for &euro;13 million for the pig sector and &euro;2.8 million for the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  Countries are required to notify the Commission of the measures to be taken before 30th June, and to pay the supports by 30th September 2022. My officials are developing the scheme at present in order to deliver a rapid as possible payment to farm families.</p>  <p>  The financial schemes detailed above are part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets, with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the options available to them. </p>  <p>  This is period of considerable challenge for the agri-food sector as a whole.

At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of fertiliser, animal feed and fuel.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response. </p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response and to develop contingency plans &amp;amp; advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. </p>  <p>  I have announced a number of measures over the past three months to assist the agriculture sector and am currently considering what additional measures will be necessary.</p>  <p>  Fuel has seen a very significant price rises in recent months. While primary responsibility for the taxation of fuel is with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agri-food sector. Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in the Energy Tax Directive and the Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of Mineral Oil Tax is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or agricultural diesel. </p>  <p>  Mineral Oil Tax is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;. In March this year the Minister for Finance reduced the excise rate on agricultural diesel by 2 cents per litre and then again by an additional 3 cent from 1st May. This total reduction of 5 cent reduces the non-carbon component, or excise, to nil. </p>  <p>  The current rate of Mineral Oil Tax on agricultural diesel is &euro;111.14 per 1000 litres. This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 litres.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p>  <p>  I also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. As well as an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel, a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline), is allowed.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our agri-food sector through this period of significant upheaval.  </p></reply>

Strong market returns across the core categories of butter, cheese, and powders, coupled with diversification efforts into new markets have led to a sustained increase in value.</p>  <p>  Last year, we exported over 1.6 million tonnes of dairy products to approximately 147 different countries. Ireland is currently the 10th largest dairy exporter in the world, shipping over 85% of our dairy products to the EU and beyond.</p>  <p>  The outlook for Irish dairy remains positive as buyers seek to secure product amid weaker European and Oceania milk output, a factor which has assisted in sustaining high dairy prices. </p>  <p>  I am, however, acutely aware of the potential pressures being faced by many sectors across the agriculture industry due to the increase in input costs, exacerbated by the impact of the illegal war in Ukraine.  My Department will continue to monitor the markets and any impacts on the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to the other key challenge faced, the dairy sector accounts for approximately 40% of total greenhouse gas emissions within agriculture sector, so it is clear that emissions from the sector will need to be stabilised and then reduced in order to bring the agriculture sector into its target reduction range of a 22%-30% reduction.</p>  <p>  The Food Vision Dairy Group, which I established, is tasked with advancing the actions for the dairy sector identified in Food Vision 2030, the ten-year stakeholder-led strategy for the Irish agri-food sector; and I expect to receive an interim report from the Group this week.</p>  <p>  I am confident that working together we can stabilise and then reduce emissions from the dairy sector, positioning Ireland as a world leader in sustainable food systems, meeting our climate targets, and ensuring that the market delivers a reward for our quality, sustainably produced food, particularly for our farmers, and their families who are the bedrock of the sector. </p></reply>

There were encouraging signs in 2021, as bTB levels were lower than in 2020, with fewer reactors and a lower herd incidence. Herd incidence at end of 2021 was 4.34% compared to 4.38% at end of 2020. </p><p>The reasons for increase in disease over the last number of years are multifactorial and often relate to a combination of national and local factors. </p><p>The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has played a role in this, since dairy herds, larger herds, fragmented farms, and herds which introduce more cattle are all more at risk of TB breakdown. Wildlife can also be a factor.</p><p>The causes of TB outbreaks are multi-factorial, varying from county to county, and even within counties, requiring a range of actions to address the problem. </p><p>My Department's policy Divisions are supported by the 16 Regional Veterinary Offices throughout the country, each of which prioritises bTB management. Within each county, the bTB programme focuses on testing compliance and frequency, isolation of reactors, control and vaccination of wildlife, contiguous programmes, forward and backward tracing of risk animals, gamma interferon testing and cleansing and disinfection. </p><p>Each TB outbreak is investigated by a Department Veterinary Inspector (VI) to seek to determine the source of infection. In every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, a VI visits the farm to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and to enable the farmer to take the measures needed to help reduce the risk of recurrence.</p><p>In an area that show a significant increase in bTB levels, the Regional Veterinary Office (RVO) implements a High Impact bTB Control Plan and works with farmers and other stakeholders to reduce levels of bTB in those areas.  These control plans involve increased levels of testing and other control measures being implemented in the area. Intensified co-operation and collaboration with local farmers and other stakeholders in these areas helps to reduce the level of disease as seen recently for example in the Cavan, Monaghan and Clare areas (see the herd incidence table below). </p><p>In January 2021, I launched a new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030. One of the strategy's key strategic actions is the further development of High Impact bTB Control plans in consultation with the Implementation Working Group of the TB Stakeholder Forum.</p><p>Ireland's bovine TB Eradication Programme operates in line with best national and international scientific research and advice. A large body of peer-reviewed research has been conducted into the spread of bTB in Ireland and the risks underlying its transmission. This research has found that the principle causes of bTB spread include:</p><p>-  the movement of cattle with undetected infection;</p><p>-  residual infection in cattle previously exposed to bTB, but not identified at that point as being infected;</p><p>-  spread across farm boundaries;</p><p>-  indirect spread through biosecurity breaches, and </p><p>-  spread from infected badgers to cattle.  </p><p>This research has recently been reviewed in its entirety for the Bovine TB Stakeholder Forum by its Scientific Working Group which comprises a panel of internationally recognised experts in bTB research. The results of that review are available on www.bovinetb.ie.</p><p><b>Herd Incidence Table for Cavan, Monaghan and Clare (</b>High Impact bTB Control Plans)  <b>. </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Herd Incidence 22nd May 2022</th>       <th>Herd Incidence 23rd May 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>4.59%</td>       <td>5.58%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>2.93%</td>       <td>3.84%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>5.62%</td>       <td>6.81%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Overall</td>       <td>4.33%</td>       <td>4.31%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This new stakeholder group will be established in the coming months. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is funding research on deer ecology in Ireland.

Following a record year for Family Farm Income in 2021, Teagasc has forecast that a decline in 2022 is now highly likely, as output price increases will fail to offset the rise in production costs. Significantly higher production costs will be a feature across all sectors in 2022, with higher fertiliser, feed and fuel prices leading to an increase in agriculture input costs. </p><p>The current market outlook for output prices is uncertain, with significant upward pressure apparent, but this is unlikely to cover the additional input costs for many farmers.  </p><p>Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p><p>I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p><p>There are sufficient supplies of fertiliser and animal feed at present although price remains a concern. The Government have introduced a temporary reduction in excise duty on fuels, assistance on the price of electricity &amp;amp; gas, and a targeted and temporary grant scheme for hauliers, all of which will be of some assistance to farmers and the agri-food sector.</p><p>I have announced a number of measures worth &euro;35 million over the past three months to assist the agriculture sector including:</p><p>-  &euro;20 million in two packages for the pig sector, </p><p>-  &euro;12 million for the tillage sector </p><p>-  &euro;3 million for the horticulture sector</p><p>These targeted measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine. </p><p>Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder (silage and/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a Fodder crisis during the coming winter. My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme.</p><p>Following discussions at EU level, the European Commission announced in March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. </p><p>I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval. </p></reply>

This programme provides small grants to community groups to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. The 2021 CEP is now closed and it is hoped to run another CEP later in 2022, however, details of this programme are not yet confirmed.  I would advise the local groups to check www.gov.ie/drcd on a regular basis for updates and to also make contact with their Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) for further details on the programme.</p>  <p>  In November 2021, the &euro;9m Community Activities Fund was launched and allowed groups apply for funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment within their community. This scheme is part of the CEP and is also administered by the LCDCs. The Community Activities Fund is now closed to applicants. Details of successful projects from each LCDC will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/drcd.</p>  <p>  The LEADER Programme is also a source of funding for rural areas and the purchase of community defibrillators may be eligible for LEADER funding.  Groups should contact their Local Action Group to determine eligibility.</p></reply>
