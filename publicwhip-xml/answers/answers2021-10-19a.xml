The Programme for Government also provides for establishment of Citizens' Assemblies to consider biodiversity; matters relating to drugs use and the future of education.   </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the appropriate methodology for future Citizens' Assemblies, but any decisions in this regard will be guided by the experience of the Gender Equality Assembly which completed earlier this year.  An independent researcher was appointed by the Assembly to monitor and record, amongst other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Assembly.  This report, published in July 2021, will assist in decisions on future Assemblies use of virtual meetings. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from relevant Departments on the approach to be taken with regard to these Assemblies.   It is envisaged that they will be established after the Dublin Mayor Citizen's Assembly has completed its work, but the specific timing of each Assembly has yet to be confirmed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-19a.41.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101900064#WRC02800"><p>Lung cancer screening is receiving increasing attention and the international evidence in this area continues to build. However, there are currently no nationally organised lung cancer screening programmes worldwide. </p>  <p>  Our policy priority continues to be a focus on primary prevention. Because we know that 9 out of 10 lung cancers are caused by tobacco consumption, we continue to do what we can to drive down our smoking rates. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing legislation to require the licensing of every retailer of tobacco products,  and to ban the sale of cigarettes from self-service vending machines and at locations intended for children and events organised for children. This legislation will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny on 3rd November. I look forward to that debate and continuing to keep Ireland at the forefront of global tobacco control.</p>  <p>  In addition, and in accordance with our national tobacco control policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, we have year on year increased the price of cigarettes. Last week, we added 50cent to the price of a packet of cigarettes, with a pro-rata increase on all other tobacco products.</p>  <p>  With regard to any future decisions about lung cancer screening,  these will be made on the advice of the National Screening Advisory Committee. This Committee is an independent expert group which considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria.</p>  <p>  All population cancer screening programmes are associated with both benefits and harms, and lung cancer screening is no different.  So it's important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards.</p>  <p>  Consideration of targeted lung cancer screening is referenced in the European Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Beating Cancer Plan&rsquo; which was published earlier this year, and a number of international trials have provided evidence that low-dose CT screening can reduce lung cancer mortality.</p>  <p>  Developments here in Ireland will be informed by the evidence and advice emerging from the wider international work in this area.</p>  <p>  I will also briefly mention that the National Screening Advisory Committee will shortly be launching its first 'annual call' for proposals on new screening programmes. This will give an opportunity, for the first time, for members of the public, health professionals and the HSE  to submit suggestions about new screening programmes, as well as changes to existing programmes, to the Committee for their expert assessment. This will help ensure screening in Ireland continues to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.   </p></reply>

This safeguard  will protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and  businesses across Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Amendment has also extended the 3-year cap on financial assessment of the value of a principal residence to the proceeds from selling that home while in Fair Deal.

The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements varies between disciplines.

The clinical hours component of undergraduate training for nurses and midwives is almost 50% of the course. Student nurses and midwives must undertake placements across a wide variety of care areas to fulfil course requirements and often these placements are away from the base hospital setting. In these instances, travel to, and alternative and additional accommodation to normal place of residence is sometimes required for a number of weeks. This is supported by an allowance towards the cost of additional accommodation. This is a vouched system of support in place since 2004 and only applicable for some clinical placements.   </p></reply>

While not required by the Act, diagnostic assessments will continue to be provided, as appropriate, and these will be captured in the child&rsquo;s Service Statement as part of the Assessment of Need process. </p>  <p>  These improvements, particularly the new Preliminary Team Assessment, will facilitate children with disabilities to access assessment much quicker. This is borne out by the latest data I have from the HSE which indicates that over 90% of children who have had a Preliminary Team Assessment are referred for intervention. All of these improvements are intended to alleviate the current situation where children in some parts of the country may have to wait a number of years before they can access an assessment. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, we are providing additional funding for the recruitment of therapists and admin support to these  Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams.

While the number of overdue Assessment of Need stood at 6,558 in June 2020, through a combination of different measures, by the end of September 2021 approximately 6,040 children have had their assessment completed, thus reducing the backlog to 520 cases. An overall reduction of 92% to date.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 6 CHOs, including CHO2, which had 100 overdue Assessments of Need at the end of June 2020 have now cleared their backlog. The breakdown of the 100 overdue Assessments per county in CHO2 at that time was 58 in Galway, 39 in Mayo and 3 in Roscommon.</p>  <p>  The number of overdue Assessments at the end of last month, September, in CHO2 was reduced to 10, with 5 overdue Assessments in both Galway and Mayo respectively and none in Roscommon. I am informed by the HSE that Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams in Galway and Roscommon have commenced services and due to a gap in network manager posts Mayo is expected to reconfigure in December. A recruitment process is underway.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, we are providing additional funding for the recruitment of therapists and admin support to our Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams. This multi-million-euro investment will hopefully reduce the length of time children are waiting to access these vital services</p>  <p>  My focus over the next 12 months is to increase access to timely early intervention services.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.    </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack. </p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients. </p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  With regard to the particular query raised in relation to the average waiting time for surgery for scoliosis patients I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Attendance figures have now reached 2019 levels at some sites. In 2019, there were over 1.34 million attendances at EDs nationally, and of these, 350,000 required admission to hospital.</p>  <p>  The health sector is expecting to face significant challenges this winter in providing emergency care while also dealing with Covid-19 in addition to the normal challenges of the Winter period.</p>  <p>  In response to these challenges, the Government , through the 20/21 Winter Plan and budget &rsquo;21, invested &euro;1.2bn to fund significant initiatives across the health service in the acute, community care and primary care sectors. These initiatives aim to reduce demand on emergency care by, for example, providing additional bed capacity,  alternative care pathways outside the acute sector and additional home support. The Government has maintained this level of investment in budget 2022 and provided a  further &euro;22m to enhance specific additional winter initiatives in 2022. </p>  <p>  The HSE is to submit a plan to me which will ensure that the health service is prepared for the challenges of Winter 21/22 and will  reflect the substantial level of investment being committed to by Government. The plan will implement new ways of working, open additional capacity and continue to enhance infection prevention and control measures in healthcare facilities, thereby providing for the appropriate, safe and timely care for patients by ensuring insofar as possible that effective levels of capacity and resources are in place to meet the expected growth in activity levels.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>On the 7th   October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.    </p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p></reply>

Through waiting list initiatives, the HSE also  procures orthodontic care through private service providers. Since 2016 approximately 2,000 patients have received treatment through this process.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that they do provide treatment for patients who are awaiting procedures under the category of 'Dental/Maxilla-Facial Surgery'. The NTPF further advise that children can avail of treatment through the NTPF, including for dental procedures. The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme, operational since 1 January 2021 on an administrative basis, enables persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for private healthcare, including orthodontic care, in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland. It should be noted that the scheme operates on parameters similar to the EU Cross Border Directive. Patients are advised to contact the HSE Cross Border Directive office directly for further information on individual applications and types of treatment available under the NI Planned Healthcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU Cross Border Directive Scheme in all other remaining EU/EEA countries. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, persons seeking to utilise these schemes should review and adhere to the public health guidance and restrictions in place at any point in time. </p></reply>

In line with commitments made in the Programme for Government, Budget 2022 commits a substantial financial investment of &euro;31m to support women&rsquo;s health projects. This includes investment in the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy, investment in gynaecology services and a doubling of the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund from &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million.</p><p><b>National Maternity Strategy </b></p><p>Funding of &euro;8.66m has been allocated for the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy for 2022. Implementation of the Strategy is required to ensure standard, consistent models for the delivery of a national maternity service that reflects best available evidence and ensures that all pregnant women have appropriate and informed choice, as well as access to the right level of safe care and support 24 hours a day. The funding and the associated WTEs will ensure the continued roll out of the Strategy&rsquo;s model of care and its 3 care pathways &ndash; Supported, Assisted and Specialised. </p><p>Funding allocated for 2022 will permit the recruitment of an additional 99.5 WTEs into maternity services across the country. The posts will cover a variety of disciplines, including, obstetrics, neonatology, endocrinology, anaesthetics, dietetics, midwifery, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  </p><p>These posts are required to ensure the Strategy&rsquo;s vision of a new model of integrated, team-based care that provides increased choice to women while ensuring that every woman can access the right level of care, from the right professional, at the right time and in the right place, based on her needs. Continuing the phased implementation of the Strategy is vital to ensure that these objectives are met.  </p><p>Funding allocated to the Strategy in 2022 will ensure: </p><p>- All maternity services will have a minimum of six permanent consultant posts thereby eliminating the need for the continued reliance on temporary and locum post holders and enabling sustainable built-in cover and on-call rotas; </p><p>- Increased availability of medical specialists in the area of endocrinology, ensuring that all maternity services have at least one dedicated CMS in the area of diabetes care; </p><p>- Expanded provision of out of hours consultant anaesthetist availability for maternity services; </p><p>- AMP posts developed specifically in the management of high risk women; </p><p>- Development of dedicated midwifery senior resources within maternity services dedicated to the area of foetal monitoring surveillance; </p><p>- Development of two dedicated postnatal hubs targeted at supporting women for up to 14 days post birth and addressing many of the gaps and deficiencies identified by women in the area of postnatal care including education, breastfeeding supports, physiotherapy, emotional and physical supports; </p><p>- Increased on-site presence of senior midwifery decision makers across a range of areas including community services, delivery suites, antenatal and postnatal wards;</p><p>- Support provided to national lead roles in NWIHP in the area of breastfeeding and antenatal education and obstetric emergencies with a view to strengthening training and education supports;  </p><p>- Increased access to key allied health professional services and supports including dietetics and medical social work; and improved care provided to neonates in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Model of Care for Neonatal services.</p><p>The additional funding in Budget 2022 will ensure continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy into 2022 and beyond, building on the significant investment in 2021.  </p></reply>

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.</p>  <p>  I am committed to progress in the area of women's health, and menopause as a priority within that. In September, I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p>  <p>  The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. Budget 2022 has supported  further developments in menopause care by increasing the number of specialist menopause clinics from 1 clinic to 4 clinics nationally.   </p>  <p>Work is underway to open the specialist menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital, with administrative and clinical posts currently in the process of being filled. The clinic is expected to be operational in November.   </p></reply>

In addition, it is likely that the settings in which services are being offered &ndash; in general practice and in maternity hospitals &ndash; have contributed to protecting patient privacy. However, we are aware of reports of some protests which have caused distress to those accessing and providing services.  </p>  <p>My Department is in regular contact with the HSE and has liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on safe access to services. The Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda stations raising awareness about the issue.

These initiatives aim to reduce demand on emergency care by, for example, providing additional bed capacity, alternative care pathways outside the acute sector and additional home support packages. The Government has maintained this level of investment in budget 2022 and has also allocated a further &euro;22m, to enhance specific additional winter initiatives in 2022.</p>  <p>  The HSE is to submit a plan to me which will ensure that the health service is prepared for the challenges of this winter, and which will reflect the substantial level of investment being committed to by Government. The plan will implement new ways of working, open additional capacity and continue to enhance infection prevention and control measures in healthcare facilities, thereby providing for the appropriate, safe and timely care for patients by ensuring, insofar as possible, that effective levels of capacity and resources are in place to meet the expected growth in activity levels.</p>  <p>  When the Winter Plan for is finalised it will be an operational matter for the HSE to determine any specific measures and associated additional resources that may relate to Naas General Hospital. </p></reply>

Further improvements in breast cancer survival rates are to be expected over the lifetime of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. Additional funding of &euro;12m has also been allocated in 2021 for the restoration of cancer services in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support.</p>  <p>  The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment.  An important message to everyone now is that, if you have any concerns about cancer, please go to your GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p>  <p>  I have now secured a further &euro;20m in Budget 2022 to progress the delivery of the National Cancer Strategy and this will have a significant impact on access to cancer diagnostics, treatment and support to patients across their cancer journey. </p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.    </p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p></reply>

The Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 and the Winter Plan 2020/21 to fund 1,146 additional acute beds (excluding critical care), on a permanent basis by the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  As of the end of September 2021, the HSE has reported that 790 of these beds had opened.  A further 148 beds are due to open between now and year-end 2021, and an additional 184 acute beds are scheduled to come on stream in 2022.  The HSE has advised that 30 beds contained in the initial plan will not open due to a variety of issues ranging from lack of physical space to lack of clinical capacity and staffing challenges.  These additional beds represent a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,590 acute beds would be required by 2031 under a reform scenario, to support the projected increase in demand for services in the years ahead.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.   </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.</p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients.</p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p></reply>

I am also acutely aware that any proposed changes to health services can be a source of great anxiety and worry for communities affected, and I am determined that any changes to the service at Navan must be done in consultation with the local community. I have therefore instructed the HSE to pause in the planning of these changes in order to engage in consultation with elected representatives on behalf of local people.</p>  <p>  The context for these changes is the Smaller Hospitals Framework, as referenced by the Deputy, which was approved by Government and published in 2013. The Framework included a list of nine designated Model 2 Hospitals, including Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan. Navan will be the last of these hospitals to transition to Model 2. The HSE has advised that changes to the services at Navan, in line with the Government Decision, are necessary to support safe service delivery on a sustained basis and to address clinical concerns.</p>  <p>  The HSE's planning envisages the development of a 24 /7 Acute Medical Assessment Unit, along with a 12/7 Local Injuries Unit, and an extended role for the hospital in areas such as day and ambulatory surgery. I am advised that this would see the significant majority of current footfall continue, with the hospital in the future providing more care rather than less, but at the right level of complexity in clinical terms, and supported by the necessary investment.  </p></reply>

The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.   </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.</p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients.</p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  In relation to the information requested by the Deputy regarding plans to outsource children for scoliosis surgery and the number of children waiting in County Cork, as the issues raised by the Deputy relate to operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In 2022, we will see the establishment of a further 6 ambulatory gynaecology &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; clinics, increasing the total to 20 clinics nationally, at a cost of &euro;3.31 million; extended endometriosis services in Tallaght and Cork at a cost of &euro;1.39 million; and further developments will be made in menopause care by establishing three new specialist menopause clinics, based in Galway, Cork and Limerick, at a cost of &euro;0.58 million.</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;0.25 million will be allocated to Sexual Assault Treatment Units.</p>  <p>  - Budget 2022 also commits &euro;0.7 million as a first-time investment in tackling period poverty.</p>  <p>  The remainder of the women&rsquo;s health allocation will invest in existing and new initiatives, including &euro;1.34 million towards the commencement of a structured and resourced service in the Dublin and Cork regions for perinatal genetics services and &euro;0.54m towards the establishment of an obstetric event support team expert team to support services and sites that report pre-defined severe maternity incidents. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;16m in other measures to support women's health is embedded within other new measures for 2022 within the Health Vote in areas such as cancer, mental health and social inclusion budgets, bringing the overall investment in women's health to &euro;47m in additional funding provided for 2022.</p>  <p>  This additional investment demonstrates our continued commitment to women&rsquo;s health.</p></reply>

Due to the impact of Covid-19 and the pauses in screening in 2020 and again earlier this year, BreastCheck appointments have been delayed. It will take approximately 3 years to get through this current screening round when it normally takes about 2 years; however this is still within international norms.</p>  <p>  October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and BreastCheck is running a campaign which encourages women to be breast aware, know the symptoms of breast cancer and the risk factors for developing breast cancer. The campaign also explains about the impact of Covid-19 on services and provides advice for women about managing their screening appointments.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan on Covid-19 identified the continued provision of cancer care as a priority. Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), with a particular focus on urgent and time-sensitive cases.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m was allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. Additional funding of &euro;12m has also been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support.</p>  <p>  The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment.</p>  <p>  - From January&ndash;September this year, GP e-referrals for breast cancer are at 130% of 2019 (pre-Covid) activity; and   </p>  <p>  - Attendances at urgent Symptomatic Breast Disease clinics from January&ndash;August 2021 (16,211) are at 115% of 2019 levels (14,127).  </p>  <p>  An important message to everyone now is that, if you have any concerns about cancer, please go to your GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p>  <p>  I have now secured a further &euro;20m in Budget 2022 to progress the delivery of the National Cancer Strategy and this will have a significant impact on access to cancer diagnostics, treatment and support to patients across their cancer journey.</p></reply>

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across over fifty different information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included Radio, newspaper and social elements.</p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>Campaigns have achieved impressive audience reach across all media platforms. The #AntiViral Campaign had over 5.7 million impressions by mid-December 2020 &ndash; we had communicated with over 300,000 young people approximately 5 times across the platforms building awareness of the Campaign.

This system safeguards the reliability and accuracy of the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance.  The AVCP system 2+ requires that an independent Notified Body, designated under the CPR, carries out auditing of the manufacturer&rsquo;s factory production control (FPC) to ensure the integrity of the particular production control process.

At all times responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the CPR rests with the manufacturer.</p>  <p>   NSAI&rsquo;s remit does not extend to monitoring products on the market (i.e. Market Surveillance), which is the responsibility of Market Surveillance authorities.

The report is built on three pillars which are bolstered by underpinning conditions. These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment</p><p>2. Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework</p><p>Under the pillars and underpinning conditions there are 15 actions to progress remote working now and inform decision-making into the future. My Department is focussed on the implementation of the Strategy. All of the Strategy&rsquo;s actions have delivery dates in 2021. An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) has been monitoring the delivery of the actions. Three meetings of the IDG have taken place to date through which it has been demonstrated that good progress is underway.

Growing pressures and the increasingly obvious physical realities of climate change are requiring more ambitious commitments to climate action. While these trends and shifts, amongst others, present challenges and heightened risks for Ireland they are not unique to Ireland.  Officials in my Department, supported by the wider diplomatic network, continuously monitor international responses to the pandemic and industrial policy developments. </p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) published in June 2021, sets out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term economic plan to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  As well as committing to a package of immediate supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth. </p>  <p>  The Plan adopts a two-pronged recovery approach to rebuilding sustainable enterprises; supporting the domestic SME sector, which is critical to broad-based jobs-led economic growth, whilst leveraging the enormous strength of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile; increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness; accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities; and through a focus on expanding sectors, such as green and digital, life sciences, the creative industries and audiovisual sector, and the health and care economy.  Reflecting the importance of the green and digital transition, Ireland&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan and related strategies commit to driving a step change in the adoption of digital, AI and other new technologies by Irish businesses, as a critical driver of enterprise productivity and competitive advantage and to supporting enterprise on its decarbonisation pathway.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the &lsquo;France 2030&rsquo; Investment Plan announced by President Macron on 12 October 2021, includes commitments to invest in greening energy and industry, transport, healthcare, cultural innovation, space and maritime exploration. It also includes a focus on securing access to strategic raw materials, electronics and robotics, and to training and higher education to support new industrial sectors.</p>  <p>  The ERP includes a commitment to develop a National Clustering Policy and Framework to fully realise the economic potential from clustering. Clusters are a major part of the European industrial landscape and EU Industrial Policy places an emphasis on clustering to build resilience in SMEs. The Commission is also pursuing a range of identifying measures to reinforce the EU position in global value chains.  </p>  <p>  In launching the &lsquo;France 2030&rsquo; Investment Plan, President Macron also stressed the importance of developing a French and European strategy for semi-conductors including building innovation capability. The Irish Government decided on 9th June 2021 that Ireland will actively engage with these instruments which include Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) and Industrial Alliances. Ireland held calls for Expressions of Interest for involvement in Health and Microelectronics IPCEI and is currently examining proposals received.  </p>  <p>  The ERP is complemented by enterprise agency strategies. IDA Ireland published a new 4-year Strategy in early 2021.  Enterprise Ireland is currently engaged in the development of its new multi-year strategy, 2022-2024.</p></reply>

The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.   The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to get to every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. </p>  <p>  Each DA creates a &lsquo;fibre ring&rsquo; which is essential to ensure reliability, robustness and resilience. Critical to the success of the network, NBI&rsquo;s fibre rings are built with back-ups, ensuring that in the event of one fibre cable being disrupted, the whole network continues to perform.  Each fibre ring that NBI deploys is designed in a way that is non-discriminatory, meaning that as the rollout progresses, it may pass relatively urban areas at the same time as passing some of the most remote premises within the intervention area.

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, including the matters raised by the Deputy, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister.</p><p>In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base.</p><p>  Suppliers reflect their costs in the form of standing charges and unit charges. The standing charge is a fixed daily cost on a bill reflecting a combination of the fixed charges associated with providing and maintaining the supply of electricity, the collection of meter readings and a share of the supplier costs in servicing customer accounts. A low usage charge may also apply where a customer uses two units or less of electricity on average per day in a billing period.</p><p>  The position of successive Governments, for almost twenty years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices. Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers and this can mitigate for consumers the impact of price rises. Switching supplier could save a customer consuming the average amount of electricity up to &euro;285.46 on an annual electricity bill (comparison made on 18 October 2021 using a CRU accredited price comparison website).</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on energy regulatory matters, such as the matter raised in this question, to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

A new National Retrofit Plan to be published shortly will detail the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting these targets and will address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and affordability; supply chain, skills and standards; and structures and governance.</p>  <p>It is estimated that 700,000 homes are currently using networked gas or LPG for their home heating needs.   Improving the energy efficiency and decarbonising our homes is a critical climate priority and a major focus of the funding provided in the National Development Plan review.  &euro;5 billion in carbon tax receipts will be invested by my Department to support the achievement of our national targets which are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 commits &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and a further &euro;10 million from the Exchequer for the Solar PV scheme. This investment will support over 22,000 home energy upgrades, including over 6,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2. It will deliver warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills. It will also reduce emissions from the residential sector and improve air quality.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) residential and community energy efficiency schemes will be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s retrofit plan. These schemes provide free energy upgrades for households in, or at risk of, energy poverty as well as partial grants for those that can contribute to the cost. Full details on the application processes for the range of schemes operated by the SEAI are available at www.seai.ie.</p>  <p>  A new National Home Retrofit Scheme will be launched at the end of this year. The Scheme will support homeowners to achieve deeper (B2) retrofits with heat pumps and will facilitate continuous, year-round working and the multi-year planning which has long been identified as a crucial requirement by the supply chain and homeowners. Information on this scheme will be published at its launch.   </p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. The loan guarantee, which is co-funded by the EU, will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint. </p></reply>

The move to upgraded digital meters will bring many benefits for energy customers by enhancing competition, making bills more accurate, providing customers with better information on their energy consumption and empowering them with new tools to make more informed choices about their energy needs. </p><p>Accurate energy usage information across the day will enable consumers to be more efficient in their use of electricity and save money, for example by using appliances off peak. This will, in turn, reduce the need for less efficient and more costly generation at peak times. </p><p>The National Smart Metering Programme is being coordinated by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities with ESB Networks responsible for rolling out smart-ready electricity meters. This rollout commenced in September 2019 and is due to conclude by end 2024 when some 2.25 million electricity meters will have been replaced in our homes and businesses nationwide. </p><p>By end-quarter 3 2021, 493,877 meters have been installed, in spite of the challenges caused by Covid-19 restrictions during 2020-2021. The estimated number of smart meters that will be installed in 2021 will be approximately 400,000 with plans to install some 500,000 each year thereafter until the Programme's completion. </p></reply>

I understand that the CRU consultation will last four weeks, with a decision expected to be published in November and a compensation regime expected to follow shortly afterwards. </p><p>I also understand that ESB Networks will also begin a trial in the coming months of an updated and simplified grid connection process for micro-generators in the 12-50kW range.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department is developing a final scheme design for the MSS that incorporates the feedback from the public consultation and subsequent additional analysis. A proposal will be submitted to Government later this year.</p></reply>

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100. There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme.  Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. The SEAI has advised that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p><p>The average wait times have increased significantly due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place during much of 2020 as well as between January and mid-April this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. Wait times have also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead time for materials. However, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. </p><p>Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget is available to support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Warmer Home Scheme homes completed in the past five years is set out in the Table below  <b>:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Warmer Homes Scheme</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Homes completed</td>       <td>6,554</td>       <td>5,255</td>       <td>3,142</td>       <td>1,524</td>       <td>1,270</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*2021 figures to end September<s></s>2021</p><p>It is important to note that the depth and associated cost of the retrofits available under the scheme has increased significantly over the last number of years.</p></reply>

This Scheme is designed to encourage the development of retrofit One-Stop-Shops, to support home retrofit on a larger scale, and support the growth of the retrofitting industry. It facilitates home upgrades for private households, registered Housing Associations and Local Authorities who wish to participate in delivering home energy efficiency upgrades.</p>  <p>  Following receipt and review of applications by the SEAI, 47 contracts were agreed with 24 participating One-Stop-Shops. Between them, upgrades were approved for over 1,500 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 or cost optimal energy standard as per Part L of the Building Regulations. The upgrades comprised a mix of privately owned homes and homes owned by Approved Housing Bodies. </p>  <p>  The grant offerings to households range from approximately 35% for privately owned homes up to approximately 50% for Approved Housing Bodies. Based on the total grant offering across all 47 contracts, the average grant offering per house in 2021 was just over &euro;15,000. Approximately 500 homes have been completed as of end September.</p></reply>

This was subsequently included as a commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  ESB has been participating in a number of working groups established under the Just Transition programme which looked at the future of the Midlands area following the closure of the ESB Midlands stations and the ending of the harvesting of peat by Bord na M&oacute;na.  </p>  <p>  One of the working groups, which included representatives of my Department, relevant Local Authorities, and the Just Transition Commissioner, looked specifically at how the existing infrastructure on the station sites might form a part of a future renewable energy hub. To that end, ESB commissioned an internal engineering report to examine how the power plants might be re-used in the future. Options reviewed included the possibility of using other types of fuel. The report was subsequently reviewed by Fichtner, an external international consultancy firm with acknowledged expertise in these areas. These reports have not identified any viable alternative use for the existing power plants.</p>  <p>  ESB has informed the Department, however,  that it plans to lodge planning applications shortly to develop additional energy services at these sites. These will include synchronous condensers and energy storage capabilities at both locations.</p></reply>

My Department defines energy poverty as an inability to heat or power a home to an adequate degree. Analysis carried out in 2016 for the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty i.e. would need to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made since the launch of the Strategy.  The ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and again in 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions supports this, indicating that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019. Details in relation to 2021 are not yet available.</p>  <p>  Government policy for a number of years has focused on supplementing lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. </p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for residential and community retrofit next year. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Social Housing Retrofit Programme in 2022. Overall, this represents an allocation of &euro;194 million to retrofitting homes of those most at risk of energy poverty next year - an increase of &euro;20 million on this year&rsquo;s allocation.</p>  <p>  While the budget for SEAI energy poverty schemes next year has not increased, it should be noted that COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and April had a significant impact on activity and actual expenditure this year. Every effort is being made to maximise activity now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also provided for a &euro;5 increase to the Fuel Allowance to &euro;33 per week, or &euro;924 per year, as well as an extension of the eligibility criteria for the payment, by the Minister for Social Protection.  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy.  Measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit their homes will also be a key consideration for the new National Retrofit Plan which will be published later this year.</p></reply>

As part of that deliberative process, my Department along with other Government Departments and State Agencies have been actively engaged in consultation with that Department on the design of the proposed set of interventions.  The CSP in its current form is a draft proposal and the interventions outlined should be treated as such. The CSP requires a further public consultation, a Strategic Environmental Assessment, and an Appropriate Assessment before it is considered by Government before the end of this year. Therefore, the details of the strategy as currently outlined do not represent a final policy decision. </p>  <p>  It is vital that the CSP strikes a balance between financially supporting the agri-food sector and individual farmers, while also addressing the serious needs of our environment and in particular our climate, water, air and biodiversity.</p>  <p>I would also note that the upcoming Climate Action Plan 2021 will set out the measures we need to reach our 2030 targets across every sector, including agriculture. These measures will include more renewable energy, decreased transport emissions, changes in how we heat our homes but also changes to how we grow our food and look after our land. With the correct policy choices, we can reward farmers for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, producing clean energy, and improving water and air quality, while remaining profitable and competitive.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has undertaken an initial investigation into the matter and I understand that Innishannon Main Street, Co. Cork is connected to the local exchange and therefore premises on this road should be able to access speeds of up to 90Mbps. </p>  <p>  Given that this premises is located outside of the Intervention Area, I have asked my officials to pass the details on to the Department of Rural and Community Development to ascertain whether their funding programmes for remote working and improved connectivity might be relevant. The Department of Rural and Community Development will be asked to respond directly in relation to the matters raised.</p></reply>

The scheme was launched in July 2018. The table below outlines the scheme statistics for each year. Figures for 2021 are as at 30 September 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of homes</th>       <th>Value of support (&euro;)</th>       <th>MW installed</th>       <th>Co2 saved (tonnes)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>125,350</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1,820</td>       <td>4,266,405</td>       <td>6.1</td>       <td>1,609</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2,916</td>       <td>7,353,320</td>       <td>10.8</td>       <td>2,838</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (ytd)</td>       <td>2,328</td>       <td>5,333,218</td>       <td>9.1</td>       <td>2,390</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>26.2 MW installed under the scheme to date equates to an annual output of 20,960 MWhs, which equates to supporting 64.6% of the annual demand for these homes.</p><p>&euro;10 million is allocated for the scheme in 2022, an increase on the &euro;8 million allocation for 2021. The number of grants which could be achieved in 2022 with this level of funding, as well as the average value of grants and the impact of the scheme in terms of MW installed and emissions avoided, is dependent on factors such as installation size, the rate of battery installations etc., which vary between applications.</p><p>Grant supports for domestic solar PV in 2022 will align with the upcoming Clean Export Guarantee tariff and other supports to be offered under the planned Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS). My Department is developing a final scheme design for the MSS, and it is expected that a proposal on the supports to be offered will be submitted to Government later this year.</p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. This project has been selected for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan. The specific features of the scheme as well as its costing are still under development. However, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan estimated the cost at &euro;60 million, inclusive of &euro;40 million from the European funding but excluding operational costs.  </p>  <p>  The part-Exchequer and part-EU funded loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint.  </p>  <p>The loan guarantee is expected to  increase the volume of retrofit activity within the State and improve the resilience of the supply chain within the retrofit sector. The scheme will also signal to the banking sector new viable business opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

That application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports, and that work is ongoing in relation to this project.   </p>  <p>  I understand that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  This should be completed during Q1 next year and, subject to the Government decision mentioned above, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission. </p>  <p>  Secondly we have the statutory review of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 stipulates that the Strategy must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised Strategy. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has stated that, as part of its review, it is considering whether additional metro routes, above and beyond MetroLink, should be included in any revised Strategy.  </p>  <p>  The NTA plan to publish the draft Strategy for public consultation shortly and there will be a six- week consultation process with the full draft Strategy document and a number of background reports available on the NTA&rsquo;s website. Following the conclusion of the consultation process, the NTA will review and assess all of the submissions and once finalized, the Strategy will be submitted to for Ministerial approval in accordance with the legislative requirements. </p>  <p>  Inclusion in any revised Strategy is the first step in what is a very detailed and often lengthy process to enable projects move from the strategic support, enabled by inclusion in a Transport Strategy, to being a project with a Preliminary Business Case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a separate, commercially-run business, "Expressway", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to ensure the continuation of PSO services throughout 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the impact of the pandemic on the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in June 2020 the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial supports for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  Among the commercially-operated routes that have qualified for support under the temporary scheme are most, but not all, of Bus &Eacute;ireann's "Expressway" services.   Notwithstanding these supports, though, the Covid situation has still had a profound impact on the company's financial situation, that the Board of the company is obliged to address. Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020. The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30/01/2021), the 20/X20 Dublin/Galway service (which ceased operations on 28/07/2021) and the X8 Dublin/Cork service (which ceased operations on 04/09/2021).</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

The forthcoming Climate Action Plan 2021 will set a pathway towards this end.</p>  <p>  To reduce transport emissions in line with these targets, all vehicle categories must contribute. As road freight makes up over 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s land transport emissions there can be no doubt that efforts must be made to decarbonise this sector while of course it is acknowledged that there are technological delays associated with the roll out of widespread alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles. </p>  <p>  To promote the decarbonisation of the  heavy-duty sector, my Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme on 15 March 2021.The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively fuelled power-trains. To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the enterprise applying for the grant.</p>  <p>  &euro;2m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, my Department allocated an additional &euro;1m in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility. Funds for 2021 have now been fully allocated however the scheme will continue in 2022 with further funding available. Details on how to apply for funding in January 2022 will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  The European Commission proposed a revised Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) as part of last July&rsquo;s Fit for 55 legislative package. The AFIR seeks to ensure the availability and usability of a dense, widespread infrastructure network throughout the EU to facilitate a quicker transition to cleaner vehicles.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the AFIR will mandate the rollout of alternative fuel infrastructure dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles across the EU, with a strong focus on the TEN-T networks. Deployment of electric vehicle recharging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure will be prioritised in the proposed regulation.</p>  <p>  Recognising the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the Irish haulage sector, my Department has also commissioned a number of studies to identify concrete actions that haulage operators and companies can take to reduce carbon and other emissions. Involving industry, academia and public bodies, these studies examine how best to maximize the emission reduction potential of the existing HDV fleet, and to identify the most viable decarbonisation and emissions reduction options going forward, and also, in some cases, involve consultation with operators. </p>  <p>  These studies include a multi-stakeholder road freight decarbonisation study that my Department co-funded with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). The study drew together Government, transport agencies, industry and academic representatives. The objective of the Phase 1 study was to better understand the policy and logistics contexts within which the Irish freight industry operates, and to identify the most efficient and effective decarbonising measures for the sector in the medium to long term. The study sought to identify and co-design effective and affordable interventions that will have a meaningful impact in real-world road haulage conditions. A Phase 1 report was published at the end of 2020 and consideration of a potential Phase 2 of the project is on-going.</p>  <p>  A transition away from conventional fuels to cleaner alternatives is a necessary step change if Ireland is to begin to decarbonise the transport sector.  In transport, natural gas can offer a cleaner alternative to oil and renewable biogas can offer a lower carbon emitting alternative. </p>  <p>  Gas Networks Ireland has received funding from the European Commission, under the CEF Transport Fund, to install 14 public Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refuelling stations and a renewable gas injection point under the &ldquo;Causeway Project&rdquo;. The provision of refuelling infrastructure will support greater uptake of natural gas vehicles while the installation of a biogas injection facility is essential to enable indigenous renewable gas to become part of Ireland&rsquo;s future transport fuel mix.</p>  <p>  To date, CNG refuellers have been installed in Dublin Port, Cashel, Limerick, and Clonshaugh in Dublin as part of the project.  The construction of several other refuellers is underway or planned. In addition, there are also three privately owned stations in operation.</p>  <p>  GNI also received approval for funding through the CEF for &ldquo;Green Connect&rdquo; to roll-out a second phase of CNG infrastructure on completion of Causeway.</p>  <p>  The excise rate for natural gas and biogas as a transport fuel is set at the current EU minimum rate. This rate puts CNG in a competitive price position with diesel. In addition, Budget 2019 saw the introduction of an accelerated capital allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment. This enables businesses to write down the cost of such vehicles or equipment up-front in the year of purchase rather than spread over 8 years. In Budget 2021, this scheme was expanded to include hydrogen vehicles and equipment.</p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme supports biogas by allowing fuel suppliers to claim biofuel certificates for biogas which suppliers can use to meet their biofuel obligations.  The biofuel obligation requires that fuel suppliers place a certain biofuels (which can include biogas) in road transport in proportion to amount of petrol and diesel they place.  It is my intention to extend the scheme to also provide similar support for renewable hydrogen.</p></reply>

The Directive requires all online service providers to capture additional transaction information pertaining to the cardholder and to send this to the cardholder&rsquo;s bank. The cardholder&rsquo;s banks use this data to verify the cardholder, with the intention of making the transaction process as seamless as possible, and removing or reducing any extra layer of friction at the payment stage. The aim of the Directive is to reduce online fraud and increase cardholder confidence in using online services.</p>  <p>  My Departments Online motor tax service, at www.motortax.ie, is fully compliant with the Directive's requirements. All necessary technical changes have been made to the website to facilitate the requirements, and my officials worked directly with the banking institutions to ensure any initial teething troubles were addressed. </p>  <p>  It is important to note however the requirement ensures that electronic payments are performed with multi-factor authentication  to increase the security of electronic payments. Such multi-factor authentication can require a cardholder having to download their bank&rsquo;s app on their mobile phone or tablet, or amend settings on the device to enable notifications to be received, and this may require the cardholder having to engage directly with their bank to address any issues they may have in this regard. My officials also provide assistance for such issues. </p>  <p>  The Online Motor Tax service itself has continued to grow since the introduction of the Directive, with 3.36m online motor tax discs issued for the period January to September 2021 inclusive, an increase of 66,000 discs (2%) for the same period last year. Almost 90% of all motor tax transactions are now processed online.</p>  <p>  While motor tax payment arrangements at the motor tax offices is a matter for the local authorities, I understand that in general such services are offered through physical appearance at the office, or via postal applications; as opposed to a telephone service.</p></reply>

Of the five projects, DART+ West and DART+ Fleet are the most advanced and Government approval will allow DART+ West enter the statutory planning system and also allow a contract to be signed in relation to DART + Fleet with the first of that fleet expected to arrive within 4 years from contract signing. </p>  <p>  The initial DART+ Fleet order includes provision for battery-electric fleet which will be used on the Northern Line in advance of the electrification of the network under the DART+ Coastal North project. Design consultants have been appointed to the project and next year will see the start of the non-statutory public consultation process in relation to the project, as has been happening this year with DART+ West and DART+ South West. </p>  <p>  As can be seen, the Northern Line will see significant capacity and service improvements in the short, medium and longer term and I look forward to working with him as we roll-out these improvements in the coming years.</p></reply>

The RSA has also begun engaging with recognised states to examine the possibility of extending current agreements for car licence exchange to include higher categories.</p>  <p>  Reaching a driving licence exchange agreement with another country is a comprehensive process, carried out between the statutory licensing authorities in each state. To ensure the safety of road users, such agreements are reached only when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes and are satisfied that they are comparable.

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p><p>As regards funding for road maintenance projects in Laois and Offaly, within the budget available to the Department, funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. </p><p>Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment under the revised National Development Plan continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.  Allocations for 2022 will be notified to local authorities early next year. </p><p>There has been and continues to be ongoing discussion between the Department and Offaly County Council in relation to roads which are built over peat. Separate to the normal grants for road maintenance / rehabilitation works, Offaly County Council requested funding for an investigation scheme in 2019 to determine the extent and depth of peat underlying certain key regional routes in the county. This information is essential in order to determine the most cost effective way of overcoming the ongoing problems with these roads. The Department agreed to an investigation scheme and as it progressed the Department made payments to the Council of &euro;165,000 in 2019, &euro;26,967 in 2020 and has provided an allocation of &euro;40,000 in 2021. </p><p>These grants have allowed a significant number of site investigation works to be carried out (more than 300 boreholes, nearly 100 dynamic probes and more than 50 window samples). The Council is currently preparing drawings detailing the extent of the peat underlying the key regional roads and will report to the Department on the findings in 2021. </p><p>The report will outline the results of the investigation scheme along with feasible solutions and cost estimates based on the Council&rsquo;s experience of such works on national roads. Upon receipt of the report the Department will discuss with the Council the choices and costs in terms of rehabilitation works on roads over peat and how targeted interventions can best be accommodated in terms of the funding available to the Council under the Department&rsquo;s investment programmes.</p><p>As regards the funding available to Laois and Offaly County Councils for road widening works, any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).  Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.</p><p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the maintenance and improvement of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<b></b>This is also subject to the Public Spending Code Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals. In this context, TII is best placed to advise on the current status of national roads in Laois and Offaly.</p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The national car and van fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including</p><p>EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions. </p><p>The Government has already committed significant funding to support low emitting vehicles through the National Development Plan, which currently includes an allocation of almost &euro;500 million for the period 2021-2025 and additional support from the Climate Action Fund.  The following table outlines the EV programme allocations from 2011 to 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>EV Budget Allocation </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>&euro;5,350,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>&euro;1,830,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>&euro;1,150,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>&euro;1,450,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;3,050,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;3,550,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;5,150,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;9,800,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;30,100,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;36,600,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;36,500,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The eSPSV grant scheme was introduced in 2018 to support the uptake of electric vehicles in the taxi, hackney and limosuine sector.

The project involves installing taxi dedicated electric vehicle chargers at major transport hubs nationwide. 1.5m in funding was allocated in 2020 which saw chargers installed in Dublin (Heuston), Cork and Limerick (Colbert) train stations as well as Dublin and Cork airports. Additional funding of &euro;3m  was allocated in 2021. </p><p>An alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle grant scheme was launched earlier this year to encourage operators in making the move towards more environmentally friendly models. &euro;3m has been committed to this scheme with further funding to become available in 2022. </p><p>The Electric Vehicle Toll Incentive Scheme was launched in 2018 to encourage private car commuters who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an EV. Under the Scheme, BEVs and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles. The Scheme received &euro;1m in funding in 2018, &euro;1.5m in 2019 and 2020, and &euro;2m in 2020. It will continue to be funded in 2022. </p><p>In addition, &euro;100m has been allocated in 2022 to ensure the continued transition to electric vehicles.  This is an almost doubling of the provision made available in 2021 and underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making electric vehicles accessible to all. This funding will continue to incentivise the switch to electric vehicles as well as enabling the expansion of a fast and rapid electric vehicle charging network to stay ahead of demand. </p><p>Preparations are underway to establish an appropriately staffed and resourced Office of Low Emission Vehicles.  Dedicated funding will be allocated to the OLEV as a part of the funds allocated to supporting a switch to electric vehicles in 2022. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the post 2008 recession. As a result there is a backlog of road repair works in all local authority jurisdictions across the country. </p>  <p>  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment under the revised National Development Plan continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  Within the budget available to my Department, grant funding is allocated on the basis of grant programmes and not on the basis of the category of road. The allocation of funding across specific roads or across categories is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the funding available to it from local and central sources as well as its particular priorities.</p>  <p>  The main Regional and Local Road Grant programmes are focussed on specific policy objectives i.e. surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage, road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of roads and a Discretionary Grant Scheme which allows for a specified range of activities including winter maintenance.  These 3 grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated taking into account the length of the road network and traffic factors in a particular local authority area.  Apart from a requirement that 15% of the road strengthening grant is spent on regional roads, the allocation of funding to different categories of road is entirely a matter for decision by each local authority.  </p>  <p>  My Department does operate a Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) facilitate local community participation (on a voluntary basis) in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which might not be high on the list of a local authority's annual roadwork programme. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of ring-fenced funding for a CIS programme in 2018 it was decided to provide funding over a two year period 2018/2019 so as to give local authorities more flexibility in delivering this programme. Following an application process &euro;31 million approximately is being allocated over the 2 year 2020-2021 period. Applications have now been received from local authorities for funding for the 2022-2023 period.</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s role in this area is confined to that of a tax administration i.e. the collection of the relevant taxes and duties and the issue of the relevant excise licences on foot of:</p>  <p>  - payment of the relevant excise licence fee,</p>  <p>  - confirmation of tax clearance status by the applicant for a licence,</p>  <p>  - confirmation that the applicant for a licence has a Certificate of Personal Fitness as provided for in section 5 of the Betting Act 1931.</p>  <p>  A Certificate of Personal Fitness is a certificate indicating that an individual, or the relevant officers of a body corporate, is a fit and proper person to hold a Remote Bookmaker&rsquo;s Licence.  For applicants that reside in the State, the Certificate of Personal Fitness is issued by the superintendent of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na located where the applicant ordinarily resides.  For applicants that reside outside of the state, the Certificate of Personal Fitness is issued by the Minister for Justice and queries in that regard should be addressed to my colleague.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice may revoke a Certificate of Personal Fitness for stated reasons which are outlined in sections 5(C) and 6 of the Betting Act 1931. The Minister may also apply to the District Court for the revocation of a Remote Bookmakers Licence. In such instances Revenue will be informed of the revocation and will remove the relevant entry from the register.  It is also open to a Court under section 17 of the Betting Act 1931 to direct that an operator be removed from the Register of Remote Bookmakers in cases of conviction for an offence under that Act.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is asking about a specific entity which, it is understood, has had its licence from the UK Gambling Commission suspended and is currently in administration in relation to its trading activities in that jurisdiction. I am advised by Revenue that the entity referenced by the Deputy was issued a licence in 2018 but is currently not licensed to provide remote gambling services in the State.  </p>  <p>  It will be for the administrators to resolve issues relating to the collapsed firm, including the potential for return of funds to affected consumers.</p>  <p>  Finally, on a broader note, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Department of Justice is currently leading work on legislative proposals to comprehensively reform the regulation of gambling activities in Ireland and to provide for an independent Gambling Regulator.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation). </p>  <p>  Assessments and appeals recommenced from January 2021 following the approval of the Finance Act 2020. The first appeal hearing was in March 2021. </p>  <p>  In the context of the national effort to suppress and manage the impact of COVID-19, the ability to hold assessments has been impacted by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place and the role of the HSE Medical Officers in the roll-out of the COVID vaccination programme and in responding to outbreaks in residential care facilities across the country. The HSE has confirmed that the community medical doctors and their teams are predominately deployed to the COVID vaccination rollout in residential care facilities and other health care settings. HSE data published in April 2021 (latest data available) noted that 401 PMC assessments were conducted between January and March 2021.  </p>  <p>  Hearings of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal are held on average twice a month at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire, which has the appropriate facilities to cater for people with mobility impairing disabilities of the kind provided for under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme.</p>  <p>  Appeal hearings have run at reduced capacity for public health reasons. This is due to the need for social distancing between appellants and the board and also due to the capacity available in a busy outpatients department in a public hospital where public health measures are necessary for all.  Information supplied by the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal show that outstanding appeals from 2020 will be cleared by the 11th of November. There are 281 appellants waiting for appeal from January 2021 until the end of September 2021. This is not available on a county by county basis.</p></reply>

Rather, it is a post-retirement investment product into which an individual may opt to transfer their pension fund on retirement as an alternative to annuity purchase.  An ARF holder may withdraw all funds from an ARF, if s/he has retirement income from outside the ARF in excess of &euro;12,700 per annum.  Withdrawals from an ARF are subject to income tax deduction at source under the PAYE system, which is administered by the ARF provider.</p>  <p>  Further information on ARFs can be found in Chapter 23 of the Revenue Pensions Manual, which is available at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/pensions/chapter-23.pdf.</p></reply>

In the case of cancer, this includes whether the applicant has ever been diagnosed with cancer, the type, when it went into remission, and whether medical treatment is still ongoing. These factors are individually assessed by insurers in order to understand the level of risk involved on a case-by-case basis.  Insurance Ireland also advised that any rating that may be applied due to a past cancer diagnosis is usually time-bound, and generally speaking, would no longer apply after ten years, subject to there being no relapse or further medical complications.  However, it did state that for certain types of cancer, this may be shorter.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials have been examining discussions on this subject at EU level. I note that Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan, a strategy published by the European Commission in February, includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), via a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;.  The Department will closely monitor any outputs from this work as it continues to consider relevant issues in this area, and to engage with Insurance Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to mortgage protection insurance and home ownership, the Deputy may wish to note that under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, lenders can provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain life insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. In this regard my officials have consulted the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) which has indicated that it estimates that, on an annual basis, 2% of mortgage approvals to consumers have been granted a waiver, and only 0.05% of mortgage applications approved by its members did not proceed to draw-down due to a lack of mortgage protection insurance. Importantly, consumers who feel they have been treated unfairly by any financial service provider, including an insurer, can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that amounts of levy collected, for the years 2011 to 2015, are published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/receipts/receipts-stamp-duty.aspx.</p><p>For the convenience of the Deputy, the amounts of the levy collected are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th colspan="5">Stamp Duty Receipts</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>2015 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pension Levy </td>       <td>&euro;463.23m </td>       <td>&euro;482.88m </td>       <td>&euro;535.31m </td>       <td>&euro;742.88m </td>       <td>&euro;169.31m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The pension fund levy was introduced in 2011 in the wake of the financial crash and at a time when the economy was in serious difficulties. Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. </p><p>For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. </p><p>The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. </p><p>The performance of private pension funds is primarily a commercial matter and contingent on market circumstances and external factors. The pension fund levy was introduced to support the recovery of the wider economy and was time bound in duration.  </p><p>I have no plans to repay the levies paid on private pension funds. I do not consider it financially viable or appropriate that the savings achieved over the period of the financial emergency would be annulled, in whole or in part, by making retrospective payments.</p><p>The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to support the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers who may have ultimately borne the impact of the levy will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets, including the substantial income tax package announced as part of last week Budget. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  While NCT policy is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, from an insurance perspective, I understand that it is a minimum requirement of roadworthiness and insurers will generally require a car to have a valid NCT in order to be covered.  However, it is not the only rating factor considered in the provision of motor insurance, therefore having a valid NCT does not automatically mean that an insurer will offer cover. Insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. This may include the age of the vehicle, as well as other factors such as the driver&rsquo;s age; relevant driving experience; the type of vehicle; and so on. Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market. </p>  <p>  Insurance companies will also price and offer cover in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a vehicle and the availability of cover, different insurers will use different age thresholds. However, I understand that in recent years a number of providers have changed their acceptance criteria and increased their vehicle age threshold levels.</p>  <p>  With respect to refusals to quote for an older vehicle, it may interest the Deputy to know that under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide motor insurance to an individual if he or she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  The relevant e-mail address for the DCA is: declined@insuranceireland.eu. </p>  <p>  According to figures from Insurance Ireland, the numbers applying to the DCA have been reducing in recent years, having peaked in 2016. I believe this downward trend demonstrates that insurance reform is having a positive impact on both the availability and the cost of motor insurance. In this regard, the latest Central Statistics Office data shows that motor insurance prices are now 36.6% lower than their peak in July 2016. </p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this positive downward trend continues through the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. In particular, it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which have on average halved award levels for many injuries, should in time lead to lower premiums for customers, including motorists. In his ongoing engagement, Minister of State Fleming has emphasised the need for insurers to reflect the savings from this key reform both by reducing premiums and increasing their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas.  We will continue to hold industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines and other key actions to customers, as the insurance reform agenda progresses. </p></reply>

The VRT rate is calculated on the basis of CO2 emissions, so that cars with higher CO2 emissions attracted a higher tax liability. VRT does not apply to second-hand vehicles unless they are imported from abroad and then registered for the first time in the state.</p>  <p>  VRT has been reformed over the past two budgets to instill within the system a strong environmental rationale in line with Government policy to radically reduce emissions from road transport. The rate gap between low emission vehicles and the rest incentivises motorists in the market for a new car to make &lsquo;greener choices&rsquo;. Budget 2022 increased VRT rates progressively so that high emission vehicles are disincentised most.   </p>  <p>  Registrations have shown consistent strong trends towards vehicles in the lower emissions bands, with significant growth in electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid registrations. Accordingly, registrations of the highest emission vehicles are decreasing. This reinforces the policy intention to incentivise low emission vehicles and discourage highly pollutant cars.</p></reply>

If dividend or rebate payments are proposed in respect of the financial year-end 30 September 2021, as outlined above, prior engagement by those credit unions with the Central Bank is expected. Finally, under the 1997 Act, member approval of a resolution on the payment of a proposed dividend is required at the credit union&rsquo;s AGM.  </p></reply>

Three of these levies &ndash; Deposit Guarantee Scheme, Resolution and Stabilisation &ndash; are used to build up funds that are available to protect member&rsquo;s savings. The fourth levy is an Industry Funding Levy set by the Central Bank to offset the cost of regulation. </p><p><b>Industry Funding Levy</b></p><p>Since 2004, the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of its total assets as at 30 September of the previous year. The balance of regulatory costs has been funded by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (as amended).</p><p>The cost of regulating the sector has increased over recent years with the emergence of the necessity to increase the intensity of supervision of this sector. In 2018, the credit union sector contributed &euro;1.7 million (circa 9% of the total costs incurred in regulating the sector).</p><p>During 2019, I approved the Central Bank request to recover 50% of regulatory costs on a phased basis, starting with a 20% recovery rate for the 2019 levy (levied in 2020), moving to 35% in 2020 (levied in 2021) and to 50% in 2021 (levied in 2022). I have also recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: 1) the levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and 2) a public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p><p>Given that all other financial services sectors are at, or moving towards, 100% recovery, the move towards 50% in respect of credit unions, with further increases at that time being subject to consultation and Ministerial approval, is measured and takes account of the role that credit unions play in Irish society. Exemptions from levies result in a burden on the tax-payer through state subvention.</p><p><b>Resolution &amp;amp; Stabilisation Levies </b></p><p>Following a review of the Resolution Levy in 2019 I announced a reduction in the levy rate which resulted in a reduction of &euro;4 million per annum from &euro;9 million in 2019 to &euro;5 million from 2020, a 44% reduction. The Resolution Levy has been kept at &euro;5 million since this time. </p><p>Following review in 2020 it was decided to reduce the Stabilisation Levy for 2021 from &euro;3 million in 2020 to &euro;300,000, a reduction of 90%. The Stabilisation Levy for 2022 has similarly been kept at approximately &euro;300,000. </p><p>In combination Resolution and Stabilisation levies have fallen 56% from &euro;12 million in 2019 to &euro;5.3 million in 2021 and 2022.</p><p><b>Developments and growth in the credit union sector</b></p><p>In terms of supporting and enabling the sector to be more responsive to their communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to fulfil a role in relation to their communities.</p><p>Review of Lending and Investment Regulations</p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks. Following introduction of the new lending regulations on 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further lending capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at June 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;372 million, an increase of 18% year-on-year.  </p><p>The revised investment regulations took effect on 1 March 2018. Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).I am pleased to share with the Deputy that two credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank and will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these funds, which will subsequently lend to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). This will provide an additional funding channel for AHBs who have a large role to play in the recently announced Housing for All Action Plan.</p><p>SME Lending </p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.  </p><p>SME lending has grown 5.6% year on year to end June 2021.</p><p>Access to Finance for Retrofit </p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in recent years. My officials have been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.  Several credit union retrofit initiatives have been launched.  </p><p>Current Accounts</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that credit unions can seek approval from the Central Bank to offer additional services such as current accounts and debit cards. Over 60 credit unions have been approved to provide the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS).  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-19a.855.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101900076#WRP05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374, 375 and 376 together.</p>  <p>Solid fuel (coal and peat) is liable to excise duty in this jurisdiction in the form of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT). SFCT is a national excise and applies at different rates to four categories of solid fuel including coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat. The SFCT rate on coal, currently &euro;88.23 per tonne, applies to all types of smokeless and &ldquo;smoky&rdquo; coal.  Liability to SFCT arises when solid fuel is first supplied in the State. As solid fuels are not covered by the EU control and movement regime there are no barriers or controls on solid fuels moving between Member States and Northern Ireland. The movement of solid fuel across the border into the State from Northern Ireland does not generate a liability to SFCT nor does the physical presence of solid fuel in the State. It is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that SFCT becomes liable.</p>  <p>  If a solid fuel supplier based in the State  sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they will be accountable for SFCT when they make first supplies in the State and must register with Revenue to account for and pay SFCT.  If a supplier based outside the State brings solid fuel into the State for supply direct to consumers they must register with Revenue for SFCT.  I am advised by Revenue that the majority of registered suppliers are importers/wholesalers and producers and approximately 5% of those registered for SFCT are based in Northern Ireland.  It is important to note that where a private individual travels to Northern Ireland to purchase solid fuel for their personal use, no SFCT is payable provided the private individual accompanies the fuel back into the State.</p>  <p>  With regard to VAT, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland transactions involving the movement of goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland in either direction continue to be treated as intra-Community transactions and subject to EU VAT rules. These rules apply to business to business (B2B) supplies of goods only to / from Northern Ireland to taxable persons in Ireland and other EU Member States. The goods, including fuel products, are supplied at the zero rate of VAT and the taxable person in receipt of those goods self-accounts for VAT on a reverse-charge basis and, if applicable, takes a simultaneous VAT deduction in their next VAT return. The onward distribution and sale of a fuel product to a consumer in the State is subject to the normal VAT rules and the Irish supplier is liable to account for VAT, currently the reduced rate of 13.5%, on the supply. The consideration for a supply of goods or services is defined in EU VAT law and consists of everything which the supplier is entitled to receive in return for goods or services supplied including taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself. Therefore, VAT is chargeable on the solid fuel carbon tax element of fuel products.</p>  <p>  Where a business in Northern Ireland sells goods and arranges the transport of those goods to a consumer in Ireland, such sales of fuel products are referred to as intra-Community distance sales. Intra-Community distance sales of fuel products from Northern Ireland to a consumer in a Member State are subject to VAT in the Member State of destination of the supply, which would be Ireland if the consumer is based in this State. In such cases, the supplier of those goods is required to register, subject to a threshold, in the State and account for VAT on those supplies.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked about deliveries of coal to homes throughout the country in which Low Smoke Zones exist so I am taking it that he is referring to deliveries of &ldquo;smoky&rdquo; coal. Certain solid fuels, primarily coal, are regulated under the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels Regulations) 2012 (SI No. 326 of 2012), as amended.  These Regulations come under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and their enforcement is a statutory function of Local Authorities. They are not matters in which Revenue has a role. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, recently announced the development of a regional approach to air quality enforcement and new, enhanced regulations to support the introduction of new standards for solid fuels from January 2022. In response to a Parliamentary Question last week Minister Ryan outlined that Local Authorities will be responsible for enforcing the new regulations and will have significant powers available to them to enable them to do so effectively. He also advised that discussions with the Local Authority sector have commenced with the intention of establishing dedicated resources to support consistent enforcement of the new regulations across the country. The same enforcement procedures will apply to all solid fuels regardless of how they have been placed on the market in Ireland, including through online sales or other forms of advertising. </p></reply>

The TWSS closed at the end of August 2020 when it was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) with effect from 1 September 2020. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that since June of last year, a programme of compliance checks on employers who participated in the TWSS scheme has been undertaken, to ensure that such employers were properly eligible to receive monies and that the supports were properly paid out to qualifying employees. Revenue further advise that an investigation is initiated where following an examination of a taxpayer&rsquo;s affairs, Revenue believes that serious tax or duty evasion may have occurred or a Revenue offence may have been committed and have confirmed that no such interventions have been initiated on foot of a TWSS compliance check.   </p>  <p>  Revenue have confirmed that to date, compliance checks have been completed in respect of 64,740 employers, representing more than 99.6% of total employers in the scheme, with the remainder of such checks in progress.  The compliance checks initiated have shown very high levels of compliance with the TWSS requirements by employers, with approximately 2% of total employers in the scheme having had to repay the TWSS subsidy as they failed to meet the requirements of the scheme but did not fraudulently participate in the TWSS.  Settlements in relation to those employers found to be ineligible totalled &euro;28.6m. </p>  <p>  Revenue is undertaking a multi-faceted approach to compliance checks to safeguard the integrity of the EWSS since the scheme commenced on 1 September 2020.   This includes undertaking real time checking of PAYE compliance of employers availing of the scheme, and cross-referencing claim data against other Revenue data sources to identify anomalies or trends requiring attention.   The real time review procedures are supported by a real time engagement with employers, to facilitate timely resolution of issues, to ensure employers claim the correct EWSS entitlement or cease claiming where they no longer have an entitlement.   </p>  <p>  Revenue is also carrying out a risk-focused follow-up program of compliance interventions in accordance with The Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions.  I am advised that in most instances, agreement is reached and EWSS overpaid is recouped.   Where issues are identified and agreement is not reached, Revenue will raise an EWSS notice of assessment and employers have the option to submit an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of assessment.   </p>  <p>  Revenue have completed compliance checks on 5,762 employers and have reclaimed EWSS of &euro;10.4m.  Compliance checks on an additional 1,603 employers are ongoing, plus investigations of 11 employers where the most egregious behaviour has been identified.

Action on high risk and egregious cases, includes liaison with the Department of Social Protection and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that EWSS will continue to operate up until 30 April 2022 and during the remaining period of operation I am advised that Revenue will continue to undertake a risk focused approach to EWSS claim processing and will continue to be very proactive in identifying and challenging EWSS fraud.  </p></reply>

An Income Tax deduction is proposed amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heating and internet services for days spent working from home for remote workers.</p><p>By way of background information, Revenue currently operates an administrative practice, set out in its e-Working guidelines, to provide relief for remote workers who incur certain expenditure in the performance of the duties of their employment from home.  A tax deduction is provided for e-Workers for vouched expenditure incurred for electricity and heating at 10% of the cost, apportioned according to the number of days worked from home in the year.  Additionally, Revenue is willing to accept that 30% of the cost of broadband, apportioned according to the number of days worked from home over the year, can also be claimed.</p><p>However, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment.  <b></b></p><p>A combination of both legislative provisions and administrative practices provide relief for remote workers who incur certain expenditure in the performance of the duties of their employment from home.  Employers are also currently permitted to make payments of up to &euro;3.20 per day to employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC.</p><p>Revenue has also advised me that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners, and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a benefit-in-kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. Furthermore, the provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Finally, I am advised that Revenue practice is that where an e-Working employee uses any part of his or her home for remote work purposes, the CGT exemption for Principal Private Residences will not be restricted and, in addition, that there is no reduction of LPT due on a residential property in relation to the owner using a room in his or her home to carry out work-related activities. Detailed information on Revenue&rsquo;s operation of remote working practices, including the policy in relation to CGT and LPT are available at .</p></reply>

The portfolio also encompasses specialised spaces such as public offices, garda stations, laboratories and cultural institutions, in addition to warehouses, heritage properties, visitor centres and sites.</p><p>In any major portfolio, there will always be a certain level of vacant properties. It is normal to have an amount of space vacant, or vacant properties, at any given time as the portfolio could not function without the flexibility that it provides. Not all vacant properties will be deemed surplus to the State&rsquo;s requirements or deemed suitable for disposal. </p><p>The OPW, like other State bodies, is obliged to follow central Government policies on the disposal of surplus properties. The arrangements involved are set out in the following Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) Circulars:<blockquote>1.  Circular 11/2015: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets <br /><br />2.  Circular 17/2016: Policy for Property Acquisition and for Disposal of Surplus Property </blockquote>As a matter of policy, no property or site is disposed of until there is absolute certainty that there is no alternative State use for that property. The OPW&rsquo;s approach to managing vacant properties is firstly, to establish if the property is required for alternative State use, including the potential for it to be re-purposed either for Government Departments or the wider public service. A number of strategic properties or sites are retained in anticipation of potential State use/development in line with service demands arising from Government policy changes to public service provision. </p><p>Secondly, if no State use is identified, the OPW considers if open market disposal is an option, depending on prevailing market conditions. </p><p>Thirdly, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer. </p><p>There are no leased/rented office buildings that are not in use. </p><p>The properties listed in the attached Appendix refer to vacant office buildings owned by the Commissioners of Public Works or Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that are currently not in use.  As a matter of course, the use or disposal of these properties are being considered in line with the OPW's policy as set out above.  <b></b> <table>    <tr>       <th>No</th>       <th>County</th>       <th>Building</th>       <th>Current status</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>Clonakilty former agricultural offices </td>       <td>Alternative State use being examined with client</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2</td>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>Old Blackrock Road </td>       <td>Alternative State use being examined</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>44 O'Connell Street</td>       <td>Retained as part of strategic plans for Metro development</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>45 O'Connell street</td>       <td>Retained as part of strategic plans for Metro development</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5</td>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Cecil Street</td>       <td>Intra State transfer to Limerick County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6</td>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>Drogheda - 62/63 West Street</td>       <td>Intra State transfer to Louth County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7</td>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>Navan (Kells Road)</td>       <td>Intra State transfer to Meath County Council </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8</td>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>Customs House </td>       <td>Alternative State use being examined</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Given that the United States was (pre-COVID) the second-largest source market for tourism to the island of Ireland, worth &euro;1.5bn in 2019, it was important that I travelled to the market as we work to restart tourism from overseas. </p>  <p>  I was on hand to launch Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Green Button&rsquo; campaign. This new campaign aims to re-start tourism and encourage Americans to book Ireland as their next holiday destination. The &euro;4.1 million campaign is targeting six key gateways and 11 priority cities, to reach and engage audiences who have the highest potential to travel to the island of Ireland. It is scheduled to run until early January 2022.  </p>  <p>  I also attended business roundtable lunches with leading travel trade, carrier and media contacts in both Chicago and New York. Attendees included representatives of United Airlines, American Airlines, Aer Lingus, and the US Tour Operators Association among others. I also attended a meeting with Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Marketing Partnership Group, who are key representatives of the US travel sector.  More than 20 other tourism operators and commentators were in attendance at these events which had a heavy emphasis on Ireland's readiness to welcome back overseas tourists. </p>  <p>  I met with the organisers of the Ryder Cup to discuss the planning for Ireland's hosting of the 2027 iteration of the event in Limerick. I also met with college football representatives regarding our plans for an annual series of college football games hosted in Dublin, starting in August 2022. </p>  <p>  During this important overseas visit I also conducted a series of interviews with Travel, Sport and Diaspora media outlets in Chicago and New York to promote Ireland as holiday destination.</p>  <p>  In the culture area of my remit, I held discussions with the organisers of the annual Milwaukee Irish Fest, with the Notre Dame Institute for Irish Studies, and with a number of Irish artists at the Irish Arts Center in New York. As is set out in Global Ireland 2025, the New York Irish Arts Center, founded in 1972, showcases Irish culture through performance, exhibition and education. With the Government&rsquo;s strong support , it is undertaking an ambitious redevelopment project to construct a new state-of-the-art Irish Arts Center which is now nearing completion. This project is emblematic of the importance of Irish communities and cultural organisations abroad partnering with the Government as it looks to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. The new Irish Arts Center will be a cultural flagship in a key global city, and will permit established and emerging Irish artists across a range of disciplines to have a permanent creative home in the US.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to receive an update on the project from the Center&rsquo;s Director.</p>  <p>  Overall, I got a great sense of a strong and ongoing connection with Ireland and that people are really looking forward to coming back to visit. There is also a sense that we have handled Covid-19 well and that we are a relatively safe place to visit, thanks in no small measure to our excellent vaccination programme. </p></reply>

Significant progress on the delivery of its objectives has been achieved to date. Further details on the current range of initiatives and projects which are being supported under the Creative Youth Plan are available from the Creative Ireland Programme website ().</p><p>One of the key community-based initiatives implemented under the Creative Youth Plan is the pilot Local Creative Youth Partnerships, which are co-funded by my Department and the Department of Education.  Based within the youth service of participating Education and Training Boards, the first three pilots were established in Limerick Clare ETB, Laois Offaly ETB and Kerry ETB in 2019.</p><p>The key aim of these partnerships is to develop and strengthen local networks and relationships; to support collaboration with and between local youth services and settings and creative practitioners thereby bringing about better use of resources.</p><p>In addition to this primary focus, the funding provided by government also enables the partnerships to support the delivery of new local creative projects and initiatives &ndash; particularly targeted projects to include and engage those children and young people that are often seldom heard and least served.</p><p>The work of these pilot partnerships are guided by the key policy aims of Creative Youth, which is to expand young people&rsquo;s access to creative initiatives and activities, focus on the inclusion of every child, and support positive and sustainable outcomes for children and young people through creative engagement.</p><p>Earlier this year, Minister Foley and I agreed to expand the initiative to include an additional three partnerships. These new partnerships &ndash; based in Cork ETB, Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETB and Galway Roscommon ETB &ndash; are now being established and will add to the opportunities available locally for young people to engage with and reap the benefits of creative activities.</p></reply>

This will empower the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts flourish again in Ireland.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022 I have allocated &euro;25m for continuing supports for the Live Entertainment Sector.  While the equivalent figure for 2021 was &euro;50m this reflects the fact that during 2021 the country was subject to significant levels of restrictions with either no live performance or very small numbers permitted for the period January to September and as a result significant levels of subvention for the commercial sector was required to protect the viability of the sector. </p><p>At present, the expectation is that such significant restrictions won't be required in 2022 and therefore lower levels of subvention may be required when the sector returns to full capacity.  Of course, the Government is aware both that it will take time for the sector to return to full capacity and that Covid restrictions could become necessary again in 2022.  To this end, as part of Budget 2022, my colleague Pascal Donohoe T.D., Minister for Finance, has created a Covid contingency fund of &euro;4bn for next year.  This fund will provide certainty and flexibility for the public finances should the situation with the virus deteriorate unexpectedly over the coming year.</p><p>The funding I am allocating for 2022 will be used to support artists, arts organisations and the live entertainment sector emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, and it will ensure that people right across the country can continue to engage with the arts in 2022 and beyond.</p></reply>

Of course, the Government is aware both that it will take time for the sector to return to full capacity and that Covid restrictions could become necessary again in 2022.  To this end, as part of Budget 2022, my colleague Pascal Donohoe T.D., Minister for Finance, has created a Covid contingency fund of &euro;4bn for next year.  This fund will provide certainty and flexibility for the public finances should the situation with the virus deteriorate unexpectedly over the coming year.</p>  <p>  I understand that the full return of live performance will not happen overnight. I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. This &euro;25m will build on the supports provided by my Department during the pandemic including the LPSS, LLPSS, MEBAS, ESCSS and CECGS schemes. I will ensure that those funds are made available early in the new year and am confident that this funding will help drive employment opportunities and activity in the sector.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the &euro;25m I allocated under the Live Performance Support Scheme and the &euro;5m I allocated under the Local Live Performance Support Scheme is currently supporting events across the entire country, with live performances and events happening in every county.</p></reply>

These recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audio-visual and live performance and events sectors. I believe the delivery of this pilot will be key to underpinning the recovery in the arts and culture sector and will provide much needed certainty to the artists and creatives who choose to avail of the pilot scheme.</p><p>I was delighted that as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m for a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens, which was particularly evident during the pandemic. The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated in terms of its impact both internationally and at home. The Government recognises that bold steps are necessary for our much treasured arts, events and cultural community to come back stronger than ever before. </p><p>I established an Oversight Group to appraise the recommendations in the <i>Life Worth Living </i>report. Although the remit of the Oversight Group included the examination of all recommendations in the report, I asked that they prioritise the consideration of the Recommendation on a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for artists and arts workers as a priority. </p><p>The Oversight Group is chaired by my Department and joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members alongside a representative of the County and City Managers Association.</p><p>The Oversight Group has met eight times to discuss the Basic Income pilot recommendation alongside the other nine recommendations. To assist in these discussions, the Oversight Group established a sub-committee to focus solely on the progression of the recommendation for the basic income pilot scheme. This sub-committee met nine times over the summer months to develop a number of options that could fulfill the requirements of a pilot scheme as set out in the <i>Life Worth Living</i>report.  </p><p>The Oversight Group, with the research carried out by this sub-committee, has provided me with a preliminary report on the different options for a three year pilot scheme which I am currently considering. </p><p>A number of organisations have given presentations to the Oversight Committee in order to inform their considerations these include:</p><p>-  the NCFA (the National Campaign for the Arts)</p><p>-  Social Justice Ireland</p><p>-  Praxis &ndash; the Artists Union</p><p>-  Stephen Kinsella Economist in University Limerick who had done research in the area of artist basic income</p><p>In addition, Equity the actors union are due to present to the group this week.</p><p>This work is in addition to the policy development undertaken by my officials on this matter, including my Department's Strategic Policy Unit.</p><p>I envision that this pilot should launch in early 2022 and I believe it will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector, after the difficult circumstances they have endured over the last year and a half.</p><p>I am happy to share the minutes of the Group's meetings with the Deputy and will publish these on my Department's website. </p></reply>

To support the industry through this difficult period I have provided funding for a suite of measures designed to sustain and support live performance and employment opportunities in the sector.</p>  <p>  As part of this suite of supports, an allocation of &euro;25m was made available for the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021).  I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This scheme builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of actors, musicians, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The grants awarded will help to support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres including theatre, music and circus performance. </p>  <p>  The Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) was developed in consultation with the sector and the eligibility criteria aims to strike an appropriate balance having regard to other available supports and the need to reach as many professional musicians and crew as possible. Under this scheme, self-employed businesses including sound crew, musicians, singers, lighting and audio equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  The grants are intended to provide a contribution towards businesses costs which arise even if the business is not operating e.g. insurance, rent etc. Therefore, details of business costs were required to determine eligibility.  </p>  <p>The initial phase of the MEBAS scheme closed for applications on 30 September and I was pleased to launch a second phase of this scheme on 4th   October.  </p>  <p>  The Events Sector Covid Support Scheme is different in both scope and scale.  It is aimed at SMEs in the events sector which are not  eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS. The eligibility for this scheme was based on demonstration of a loss of at least 75% of turnover during the time when Covid restrictions were in place relative to a businesses turnover in 2019, therefore business expenses were not relevant to the criteria of this scheme.  Phase 2 of this scheme opened for applications on 7 October.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022 I have allocated &euro;25m for continuing supports for the Live Entertainment Sector. This allocation will build on the supports provided by my Department during the pandemic.  I will ensure that those funds are made available early in the new year and am confident that this funding will help drive employment opportunities and activity in the sector.</p></reply>

This scheme will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector, and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists, after the very difficult circumstances they have endured over the last year and a half. </p><p>This is a major policy intervention and is grounded in on-going dialogue with the sector.  The upcoming stakeholder forum is a continuation of the engagement myself and my officials have had with the sector on this matter. </p><p>The facilitation of 'World Caf&eacute; Method' style events is normally carried out by experienced professional communications experts and facilitators, familiar with the methodology, to ensure that the outputs of the forum, which will be large in scale, are effective and contribute to the ongoing development of this policy. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that economic and evaluation skills are central to the manner in which policy is developed in my Department.  The team lead on the pilot scheme is an economist and member of IGEES (Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service) and my Department's Strategic Policy Unit, which is staffed with six members of IGEES, are also assisting with the policy development for the pilot scheme. My officials have been engaged in extensive policy development to bring this policy intervention to fruition in conjunction with colleagues on the Oversight Group which includes the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members alongside a representative of the County and City Managers Association.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the pilot basic income guarantee scheme was a key recommendation from the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce.  I established an Oversight Group, which includes the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, to appraise the recommendations in the <i>Life Worth Living </i>report. </p><p>I asked the Group to prioritise the basic income guarantee pilot and the Oversight Group has met 8 times. To assist in these discussions, the Oversight Group established a subcommittee to focus solely on the progression of the recommendation for the basic income pilot scheme. This sub-committee met 9 times over the summer months to develop a number of options that could fulfil the requirements as set out in the <i>Life Worth Living</i>report. </p><p>A number of organisations have given presentations to the Oversight Committee in order to inform their considerations these include:</p><p>-  the NCFA (the National Campaign for the Arts)</p><p>-  Social Justice Ireland</p><p>-  Praxis &ndash; the Artists Union</p><p>-  Dr Stephen Kinsella &ndash; Economist in University Limerick and Niamh NicGhabhann &amp;amp; Annmarie Ryan who had done research in the area of artist basic income</p><p>-  In addition, Equity the actors union are due to present to the group this week.</p><p>The Request for Tender (RFT) clearly sets out that the facilitation relates to the basic income guarantee pilot for artists.  The RFT was published on my Department's website, shared via social media as well as being sent to a number of companies that specialise in this type of facilitation. </p><p>I am satisfied that a professional facilitator will add value to the stakeholder forum and ensure that the voices of artists, arts sector representative bodies and resource organisations will be heard on this important matter.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed for projects where the grant being sought is greater than the maximum grant available under the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP). The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals including 8 swimming pool projects.. </p>  <p>  Funding under the LSSIF is provided under two Streams. Stream 1 is designed for projects at an early stage of planning  to enable applicants to advance their proposals to a stage where a Stream 2  application (assistance towards actual construction costs) can be submitted.  Projects that already have a feasibility study completed are likely to receive a higher score at assessment stage. </p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered. It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p><p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: . </p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, including Working Family Payment, is assessable. </p><p>More detail on what income is assessable and the full list of disregards is available on the Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months&rsquo; net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household&rsquo;s current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  As set out in &quot;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&quot;, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.   </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted.</p>  <p>  All households in receipt of HAP pay a differential rent based on the rent scheme set by the relevant local authority. The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is set out in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that; the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; and that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship. </p>  <p>  Local discretion and flexibility are inherent in the devolved function of administering rent schemes.  Decisions regarding the increase or decrease in the rent charged to tenants of local authorities are matters for individual local authorities in accordance with its differential rent scheme.</p>  <p>  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p></reply>

With regard to the housing figures it is important to note the following;</p><p>-  The figures represent expenditure across the various housing programmes.</p><p>-  The figures represent exchequer expenditure and LPT self-funding expenditure across the housing programmes, capital and current.</p><p>-  The figures for Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council includes payments to the local authority in its role as the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Shared Services Centre (SSC). This SSC manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but, rather, recoups all landlord costs via the HAP SSC</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  -  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>  -  established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>  -  state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?); and </p>  <p>  -  value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that there was an historic project application in relation to the fire station in Rathdowney that did not eventually progress as proposed and that, in 2017, Laois County Council put in place an extension on to Rathdowney Fire Station, consisting of separate male and female toilets, a shower cubicle and a new muster bay. While a new fire station at Rathdowney is not currently included in my Department's 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme, it is included in a list for annual review. Laois County Council has indicated that a new fire station in Stradbally is their number one priority. My Department will have regard to this, and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide for funding, in considering any proposal.</p></reply>

Under Budget 2021, &euro;35 million was allocated to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, designed to facilitate Government loans to Approved Housing Bodies, to finance up to 30% of the capital costs of new homes for Cost Rental. My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to deliver initial Cost Rental projects.</p>  <p>  A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under this first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. The first 25 of these homes, and the first Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland, were acquired by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. In addition to these 390 homes, another 50 Cost Rental apartments are currently being constructed at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, alongside 105 social housing units. Construction is due to be completed in Q4 2021, and the tenant selection process is under way.</p>  <p>  The first tenants moved in to Taylor Hill from 28 August 2021. In order to be eligible for Cost Rental households must apply to the provider making the Cost Rental homes available and meet certain eligibility criteria.  Under the provisions process as set out in the Affordable Housing Act, the designation process attached to Cost Rental is linked to the property itself rather than the tenants.  As such, while my Department retains details of all dwellings designated for Cost Rental purposes, it does not centrally retain details on the specific number of tenants (including children etc.) in each dwelling.  However, I can confirm that Taylor Hill comprises a broad mix of family sizes.  In availing of Cost Rental tenancies, applicant households must demonstrate to the provider that they fall within the national eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing for All Strategy the Government recently confirmed it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, AHB's and the LDA. In building to this scale and an average of 2,000 Cost Rental Units per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners provide rental homes that target affordable rents at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  A housing authority shall disregard income that is once-off, temporary or short-term in nature and that is outside the regular pattern of a person&rsquo;s annual income, including the Rural Social Scheme. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland, commits to maintain the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in Housing for All are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

This measure significantly reduces the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3.8% p.a. in September, subject to Government approval, I intend  to bring forward legislation in the coming weeks to introduce a cap on rent increases in RPZs.  My Department is engaging, as a matter of priority, with the Office of the Attorney General in this regard. </p></reply>

The Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 provide for a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo only, to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks and is not a national redress scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department received both a written and electronic submission from Clare County Council, dated 23 July 2021, requesting the extension of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme to County Clare. A written acknowledgement of this submission subsequently issued to the Council on 3 August 2021. This acknowledgement informed the Council that my Department would review the submission and also sought a detailed breakdown of costs associated with the report.  </p>  <p>  A breakdown of costs associated with the report was received electronically from Clare Co Council on 28 September, 2021.  A formal response to the submission from Clare County County will issue shortly from my Department. My officials spoke to colleagues in Clare County Council on 8 October 2021 in that regard.</p>  <p>  Any extension of the Scheme will be considered as part of broader considerations by Government as part of the process following receipt of the Report of the Working Group on Defective Concrete Blocks. In this regard, following discussions with Government colleagues, I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government.  </p></reply>

This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 gives effect to a package of measures in line with the commitments in the aforementioned Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT.

All other elements will also be based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. It is recognised that the yield will change following the revaluation and the matter will be revisited at that point. </p></reply>

Investment is primarily delivered through Irish Water while my Department operates the Rural Water Programme directly. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services and this includes over &euro;1.4 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan.  I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for this programme was approved by the CRU. Irish Water is working with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with the local authority development plans. </p>  <p>  My Department provides funding, through the Rural Water Programme, to deliver improvements to private water services in areas of rural Ireland where there is no access to public infrastructure.  The strategic objective of the Rural Water Programme is to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of water services for rural dwellers in these areas. Private water services in Ireland include:</p>  <p>  -  Individual water supplies, typically a bored well. </p>  <p>  -  Group Water Schemes.</p>  <p>  -  Domestic waste water treatment systems, typically septic tanks.</p>  <p>  -  Collection networks, typically developer provided water services infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Complementary to Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, my Department is currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public waste water infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at a national level. This report will include the analysis of a baseline survey of all rural local authorities, to quantify and qualify the number of villages and similar settlements concerned.  </p>  <p>  At this stage, my Department reports some high level analysis of the survey results.  These indicate that some 643 villages and similar settlements, spread across 25 rural local authorities, do not have access to public waste water collection and treatment infrastructure. However, it is important to note that this is point in time data which is continuously adjusting and requiring update. </p>  <p>  This process is at an advanced stage, and I will be in a position to consider the matter once I have received the final report. </p></reply>

Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme's operation has been undertaken. In addition, Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland, commits to maintain the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in Housing for All are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government has committed to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and increase the supply of public, social and affordable homes. A multi-faceted approach is being implemented to achieve this. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Housing, I advanced the Affordable Housing Act to establish a legislative basis for 4 new affordable housing measures.  These measures are (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing. The Affordable Housing Act was enacted on 21 July 2021. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy was published on 2 September and provides the funding and the targets for the affordable housing schemes. This is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. At a national level, over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. These homes will be provided by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency, as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All Strategy also introduced the Local Authority Home Loan as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme. This new scheme will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. Additionally, from 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes. </p>  <p>  Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to increase supply in cities, towns and villages. </p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, 2020 and 2021 saw very significant disruption to the construction sector due to Covid-19 and there have been consequential impacts on drawdown of capital funds.  </p><p>For 2022, I have confirmed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that I am seeking full capital carryover of 10%, amounting to some &euro;276m.  The details of the source and subsequent allocation of that funding will be published in the REV later this year.  At this stage, I have signalled that &euro;246m of the carryover will be applied to Subhead A.3 Local Authority Housing for the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Page 44 of the National Development Plan signalled a ceiling increase of &euro;634m for my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group (from &euro;2.766Bn to &euro;3.400Bn).  This excludes carryover and when the carryover is taken into account the capital provision for my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, available for all Programmes, will be &euro;3.676m.  This will be further supplemented by LPT of &euro;78m for Housing delivery.</p><p>The table attached provides a detailed breakdown of funding for my Department in 2021 and for 2022 and will show clearly the year on year increases both including and excluding carryover.</p><p>Looking specifically at page 123 of the Budget Book, these are a selection of measures rather than a comprehensive listing of all activities. The carryover is applied to one of a number of subheads, which contribute to social housing delivery. As you will see in the attached, the total Capital and Current provision for Programme A-Housing in 2022 will be just under &euro;4Bn, of which approximately 6% comes from capital carryover. The amount highlighted for social housing delivery on page 123 represents the year-on-year increase in total funding available.</p><p>Despite the impact of the introduction of restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19, more than 7,800 new social homes were provided in 2020 and a further 3,600 were delivered in the first 6 months of 2021, of which almost 2,500 were new build social homes.  My Department is working closely with local authorities and other delivery partners to ensure the maximum number of homes are delivered this year. </p></reply>

The headline goal of the Strategy is to  transform at least 30% of Europe's lands and seas into effectively managed protected areas,  with at least 10% under strict protection. The Strategy was endorsed by the European Council in October 2020. </p>  <p>  These targets are EU-wide and represent a minimum of an extra 4% for land and 19% for sea areas as compared to today across the Union. The target is fully in line with what is being proposed as part of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework due to be agreed at CBD COP15 in Kunming, China next year.</p>  <p>  At present, only 3% of land and less than 1% of marine areas are strictly protected in the EU.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in "Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland", the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

It is anticipated the scheme will be operated by a newly established special purpose vehicle (SPV). In this regard, I can confirm that the banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this support to households who are not in a position to afford what will be modest family homes.  The sector has agreed in principle to match State equity funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners under the scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with a range of stakeholders including representatives from the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank and PTSB to consider the administrative and operational provisions of the scheme.   Work on the detailed design and operation of the scheme is advancing. The full scheme details will be confirmed on completion of this work.</p>  <p>  The preparations for the Scheme has included ongoing engagement with the Central Bank in relation to the interaction between the mortgage measures &ndash; the macro prudential rules - and the First Home shared equity scheme. Informed by this, the Scheme is being designed as an equity product rather than being a debt on the purchaser. The First Home scheme will not provide loans or mortgages to households.  The Central Bank has confirmed that it will consider the interaction of the scheme with the mortgage measures as part of the regular annual review later this year, well in advance of the planned launch of the scheme.</p></reply>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la is precluded from granting substitute consent (whether subject to conditions or not) unless it is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that justify the grant of substitute consent.</p>  <p>  As acknowledged by the Government&rsquo;s National Peatland's Strategy 2015, the regulation of peat extraction activities under the planning code has been problematic. Practical implementation of the EIA Directive through planning law, particularly in relation to private turf extraction projects, has proved difficult for a variety of reasons such as uncertainty about the ownership of peatlands and the increasing trend towards peat extraction by contractors, whose scope of operations may span lands controlled by many individuals with turbary rights.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, both the Government&rsquo;s National Peatlands Strategy 2015 and the Just Transition Commissioner&rsquo;s first progress report published in May 2020 highlight the complexity of the current dual consenting system for large scale peat extraction. The dual consenting system for large scale peat extraction comprises the requirement for both planning consents as well as licencing from the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA's) Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) Licensing system, which is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. </p>  <p>  While I have no objection in principle to making such exempted development regulations in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 with respect of peat extraction,  this would be subject to the activity being regulated by an alternative legislative regime, other than the Planning system, that is fully compliant with EU environmental legislation, including the carrying out of all relevant environmental assessments for the activity, where applicable.  </p>  <p>  This would require an alternative legislative proposal to address peat extraction, and it is noted that a similar proposal was progressed in 2019, whereby exempted development regulations were made for the Planning regime (the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) Regulations 2019, Statutory Instrument No. 12 of 2019) to complement related EPA regulations (the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Peat Extraction) Regulations 2019) made by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to be the sole competent authority for large scale peat extraction. However, those regulations were subsequently struck down by the High Court. This indicates that this area is a matter of particular complexity. </p></reply>

As famine-like conditions are reported, and in light of the recent ground offensive, there is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and the commencement of political dialogue to find a resolution to the conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to strongly advocate for an urgent response to the crisis, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict - through our bilateral engagement, our EU membership, and at the UN Security Council.  </p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious human rights violations and abuses.   It is vital that perpetrators be held to account.  In this regard, Ireland strongly supports the work underway by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to investigate reported atrocities. We are currently awaiting publication of their joint report on 1 November, which will be a crucial first step towards accountability.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the media reports to which the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers.</p>  <p>  Ireland adheres strictly to the terms of the Arms Trade Treaty, which is a treaty regulating the international trade in conventional arms and which seeks to prevent and eradicate the illicit trade and diversion of conventional arms by establishing international standards on arms transfers. Furthermore, Ireland is a member of several multilateral export control regimes. All export licence applications for military goods are reviewed on a case by case basis by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and are subject to EU Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP. This sets out eight risk criteria against which licences should be assessed, and defines common rules governing the control of exports of military technology and equipment.</p>  <p>  While the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the provision of diplomatic clearance to foreign military and State aircraft to land in and overfly the State, the operations of civil aircraft, including those under contract to other States, are regulated by the Department of Transport. </p>  <p>  The Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973 prohibits the carriage of munitions of war on civil aircraft, including on troop-carrying civil aviation operators, through Irish airspace or Irish airports, unless an exemption has been granted by the Minister for Transport.  The process in place around the granting of such permission by the Minister for Transport is robust and includes seeking the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs on any implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any such applications by the Ethiopian authorities or of any suggestion that arms or other materiel used in the conflict in Ethiopia could have been transited through Ireland. </p></reply>

We continue to call for a cessation of violence, the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained, including the President and State Counsellor, and the restoration of legitimate, civilian government. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s practice is to recognise states and not governments. We do not therefore recognise specific governments in Myanmar or elsewhere. </p>  <p>  As I have the outlined in my previous statements on this matter, the election results of November 2020 and the sustained, large-scale popular opposition to the coup since 1 February, demonstrate that the Tatmadaw (military) have no mandate to govern Myanmar. General Min Aung Hlaing&rsquo;s self-appointment as Prime Minister is a clear attempt to normalise his position and does not reflect the democratic will of the people of Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Reflecting our core values, Ireland is committed to promoting a fair, just and more secure world. In contexts of conflict, we underline the importance of inclusion and engagement of key stakeholders in negotiating acceptable and sustainable solutions. Ireland acknowledges the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and the National Unity Government (NUG) as important stakeholders in Myanmar&rsquo;s future, and encourages their involvement in discussions and negotiations to resolve the current crisis. </p>  <p>  We also commend the NUG for facilitating greater representation from women, youth and ethnic-minority groups. Ireland recognises the critical contribution of women and youth to conflict prevention and resolution, as well as peacebuilding, in Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Ireland is concerned by the announcement of proposed new elections by the Myanmar military and efforts to disband the National League for Democracy (NLD). Any election that excludes major political parties from participation cannot be either free or fair and will not deliver sustainable peace in Myanmar. The people of Myanmar have consistently endorsed the democratic path and overwhelmingly reject the military coup. </p>  <p>  We reiterate that the democratic will of the people of Myanmar must be respected for there to be lasting peace and stability in Myanmar.</p></reply>

The current turnaround time for Passport Express applications which have been completed correctly is 8 weeks.</p>  <p>  The Passport Express channel was created in partnership with An Post&rsquo;s Swiftpost option to provide customers with a passport application option through their local Post Office. As such, the Passport Service cannot change the name of this service.</p>  <p>  Passport Online will continue to be the priority channel given the efficiencies that are in-built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. In addition, currently the use of Passport Online can facilitate social distancing, given that a renewal application for an adult does not require the signature of a witness.</p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age  both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p></reply>

The current Roster of approximately 199 volunteers is in place since 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  Participation in election observation missions poses particular COVID-19 risks due to transit through international airport hubs, extensive in-country travel and interactions with observers from a significant number of other countries. This potentially exposes to Covid-19 not only election monitors, but also those with whom they interact with in the host country and when they return home.  As such, since March 2020, Ireland has not nominated election observers for EU or OSCE Election Observation Missions (EOMs). </p>  <p>  The OSCE issued a call on 21 September for the nomination of Long Term and Short Term Observers for an EOM in Uzbekistan for upcoming elections scheduled to take place on 24 October. The deadline for nominations of election observers was 30 September. For the reasons outlined above, Ireland did not nominate LTOs or STOs for this EOM.</p>  <p>  However, given the re-opening of non-essential international travel and the progress of Ireland&rsquo;s vaccination programme, my officials have been working to clarify the safe conditions for volunteer election observers before, during and after their participation in Election Observation Missions.  This work is now complete and and it is my intention to nominate observers to missions on a case by case basis, subject to adjudication of duty of care.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) manages its election observation mission through a core team of experts, which leads the monitoring and is directly recruited, which can be supplemented by long-term observers (LTOs) and short-term observers (STOs) nominated by OSCE Member States.</p>  <p>  Applications to join the core team are managed directly by the OSCE-ODIHR through a recruitment procedure that is open to citizens of OSCE participating states, including Ireland. The Department of Foreign Affairs has no role in this process. Roles as head of electoral missions, or core team members for either the OSCE or the EU are thus entirely separate from the process of nomination by Member States for LTO or STO roles, including the volunteer election observation roster operated by this Department.</p>  <p>  My officials have become aware through open OSCE channels that an Irish citizen, who is a member of ODIHR&rsquo;s core team of experts, has been designated the head of an international election observation mission to Uzbekistan. As I have already indicated, such appointments are entirely at the discretion of the OSCE itself and are not a matter for Member States.</p>  <p>  The individual in question did not request any briefing material or other supports in relation to the mission to Uzbekistan, and none were provided by my officials.</p></reply>

This is a 20% increase on the 2021 allocation, and the highest ever amount allocated to ODA by any Government.   In the context of competing budgetary pressures, achieving this amount was an important statement by the Government of Ireland's solidarity with the developing world.</p>  <p>  Given the strength of the economic recovery, this 20% increase in the overall cash allocation to ODA will, I anticipate, correspond to 0.32% of GNI for 2022. </p>  <p>  While I am very proud that we have increased our ODA so considerably this year, I recognize the need to continue to strive for increases in GNI percentage terms. This must be balanced against the need to manage the large cash increases required.  My Department is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable and responsible way. This includes working in coordination with the many other Government Departments and bodies spending Official Development Assistance, and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on how a growing ODA allocation can be managed most effectively across Departments.  This work will inform whether it might be possible and appropriate to provide a roadmap to 0.7% for 2030.</p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms, and barracks infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.   A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The replacement of the Air Corps two EC135 P2 Helicopters will be considered as part of the ongoing Air Corps Aircraft Renewal and Replacement Programme alongside other major Defence Equipment upgrade and replacement programmes over the coming years.</p></reply>

The White Paper acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the PDF and outlines an intention to harness specialist skills that members of the Reserve may have to better support the PDF.  </p>  <p>  As part of the High Level Implementation Plan (HLIP) arising from the Report of the Public Sector Pay Commission on recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, a Workforce Planning project is underway which will identify skills sets in the PDF and identify appropriate measures to address any such gaps. A skills survey already undertaken of the RDF will assist in identifying possible options to address gaps.  Options to underpin the engagement of members of the Reserve will be identified as the various stages of this work unfold. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Government has decided to retain the FLR.  A review of the regulatory framework underpinning the FLR, with a view to presenting proposals on terms and conditions of membership, is due to commence upon completion of the projects arising from the HLIP. </p>  <p>  Recruitment to the RDF is ongoing and the recruitment procedures in place are constantly reviewed and updated as required. However, given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Nonetheless, RDF recruitment will also be progressed to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  I understand that a revised Defence Forces framework for living with COVID -19 is now in place, based on the recent easing of Government restrictions and will afford more scope for Reserve Training within the parameters of government guidelines. This will further facilitate the commencement of the Reserve Defence Force Induction Process with planned induction training to commence shortly. A number of other initiatives to streamline the induction process for RDF applicants are also in train.</p>  <p>  Subhead A.5 of the Defence Vote contains the provisions for Reserve paid training. The overall budget for the RDF has been maintained for a number of years at &euro;2.150m, of which &euro;2.068m is allocated to paid training, which provides for seven days annual paid training for each effective member of the AR and NSR. The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited, along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p>  <p>  My officials have been actively involved with the Military Authorities on the process of amending and updating Defence Force Regulations (DFR) R5 (Structure of RDF) and S7 (Establishment of RDFRA). These DFRs encompass a broad range of matters ranging from Finance, Human Resource matters, Training to Effectiveness Criteria. Significant progress has been made and the revised drafts are currently being finalised. It is anticipated that final drafts of both Regulations will be available very shortly and will be circulated to key stakeholders, including RDFRA, the Representative Association for members of the RDF. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I obtained Government approval earlier this year to bring forward a Defence (Amendment) Bill which, if approved, will update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the PDF.  The Bill is entering Committee Stage this week.</p>  <p>  The Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, which as the Deputy will be aware, is also expected to include proposals on the role and contribution of the RDF, including its legislation, the regulations governing the RDF, the development of the First Line Reserve(FLR) and whether specialists from the RDF should be able to serve overseas. The Commission is due to report at the end of the year. I look forward to the outcome of the Commission's work, including any proposals relating to the future of the Reserve Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I should add that the proposed amendments to this Bill, do not prejudge any possible recommendations from the Commission however, but will facilitate the implementation of any recommendations the Commission may make, which would, of necessity, require legislative amendments.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government appreciates the service of the RDF and recognises its important contribution to Ireland's defence capability.</p></reply>

It also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks including the provision of air ambulance services to the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  As recently outlined to the Deputy, the 2015 Government Decision, which established the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service on a permanent basis, approved an additional annual provision of &euro;2.2 million to the Defence Vote. The Health Vote is reduced accordingly. </p>  <p>  The increase in the Defence Vote since 2016 has provided funding towards the reimbursement of Air Corps costs incurred in the provision of the EAS service. The &euro;2.2 million sum is based on 480 flying hours per annum and is subject to periodic costs review. </p>  <p>  The  &euro;2.2 million takes account of fixed and variable costs associated with the provision of this dedicated daytime aeromedical service.  These costs include salaries and related personnel costs and also operating costs which include fuel, maintenance and depreciation. Personnel costs associated with NAS personnel are borne by the HSE and are not reflected in the &euro;2.2 million figure. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to separate out the cost of operating a single helicopter from overall administration costs as pay and allowances and other support costs for Air Corps personnel are not identified separately, but are included in the overall programme costs in the appropriate subheads of the Vote. It also not the case that one specific heli is dedicated to the EAS service rather that a heli type, the AW139 is committed to the service, and any one of the AW139 fleet may provide the service on any given day. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-19a.1300.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101900084#WRX03600"><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that all concerns received in my Department are taken seriously and through the school inspection process, which now includes specific child protection safeguarding inspections, the Department seeks assurances that schools have the correct procedures in place to protect children. To this end, all information helps inform the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate in planning its programme of inspections in the school system. </p><p>In relation to any investigation into alleged child abuse in schools I would like to clarify that the Department of Education has no role in the investigation of individual child protection cases. This is the responsibility of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla who assess the information as reported to it by the Department and by individual members of the public. All concerns of a child protection nature received by staff in the Department of Education are dealt with in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Procedures for responding to Child Protection Concerns which come to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education. In accordance with these procedures the Department must pass on, without judgement, details of all child protection concerns it receives to Tusla.</p><p>Under the Education Act 1998, a school&rsquo;s board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school and it is the Board of Management which employs the staff at the school.  The Board of Management is accountable to the school Patron. </p><p>Boards of management are responsible for ensuring that the child safeguarding requirements of Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2017 are implemented in full and must exercise appropriate oversight in this regard including where an allegation of abuse is made against a member of school personnel.  </p><p>The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2017 provide specific guidance to schools in relation to the reporting procedures for the concern as well as the protocols in relation to dealing with the employee. In a school context, the most important consideration to be taken into account is the protection of children, and their safety and well-being must be the priority. Each school authority also has a duty and responsibility, as an employer, in respect of its employees.  </p><p>Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers is the responsibility of boards of management of recognised schools or, where the employer is a person other than a board, by that person. Any actions in relation to the employee, including whether he or she shall be placed on administrative leave while a matter is being investigated, are exclusively a matter for the employer. </p><p>It is important to note that arrangements for child protection in schools have been extensively revised and extended. In recent years, for example, the enactment of the Children First Act in 2015 led to the issue of revised Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools in 2017, with an extensive programme of professional development for teachers and school leaders. </p><p>I hope you will be reassured to know that a fundamental principle of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 is that all schools must keep pupils/students safe from harm while attending the school or while participating in school activities. My Department has also put in place a range of oversight measures to quality assure these procedures. As part of these measures, the board of management of the school must ensure any child protection concerns that come to light in a school are reported to Tusla. </p><p>Further measures put in place by this Department include the following: a policy to ensure that once an inspector has noted that a school is not compliant with any aspect of child protection procedures, the Inspectorate continues to engage with the school until the school becomes compliant, and, as noted above, a policy to ensure that the Inspectorate reports on compliance with Child Protection Procedures in all published inspection reports. </p><p>Details of published reports can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Publications/Inspection-Reports-Publications/Evaluation-Reports-Guidelines/</i>.</p><p>My Department also has in place a mandatory Stay Safe Programme in primary schools which aims to give children the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse and victimisation and teaches them that they should always tell an adult that can help about any situation which they find unsafe, upsetting, threatening, dangerous or abusive.  </p><p>The measures that have been taken to protect and safeguard children are designed to ensure that children run a minimal risk of encountering abusers and, because of the Stay Safe Programme, their knowledge of and awareness of their right to bodily integrity has been reinforced as well.</p><p>In relation to supporting victims of abuse in their childhood, when contacted by individuals my Department provides details of counselling supports available.  As part of the State's response to individuals experiencing distress as a result of childhood sexual abuse, a free National Counselling Service was set up which is run by the HSE and has been operating since 2000.  Full details are available on </p><p>.</p><p>In addition, my Department recently announced a revised ex gratia scheme to provide those, who had, by 1 July 2021,  issued legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse which occurred before November 1991 (primary) and June 1992 (post-primary) with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment. Details of the revised scheme are available at .</p></reply>

The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. </p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.</p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.</p></reply>

This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  Major buildings projects that include accommodation for special classes are being planned for two post primary schools (other than the school in question) in the town to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  One of these schools opened in interim accommodation in September 2021.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-19a.1336.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101900085#WRY01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 546 to 551, inclusive, together.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). In accordance with Department Circulars 0044/2019 and 31/2011, schools are required to employ appropriately qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The principal of the school, with the support of the board, is responsible for promoting the professional development of teachers in line with the changing priority needs of the school. Schools can access a range of continuing professional development opportunities provided by national support services, higher-education institutes and/or local education centres.</p><p>At primary, all teachers must be qualified to teach the range of subjects as outlined in the Primary School Curriculum -1999 (Curaclam na Bunscoile) to children in all classes. The ability to speak Irish proficiently and to use Irish as the language of incidental communication in the classroom is a prerequisite for teaching for all teachers. This is reflected in the Teaching Council&rsquo;s <i>Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (2011, updated in 2017)</i>, against which all programmes of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) are accredited, where Gaeilge is a mandatory element of all primary programmes.</p><p>Between 2019 and 2020, the Council reviewed its policy on standards for programmes of ITE in advance of the second cycle of review and accreditation of programmes of ITE.  Feedback from this process was incorporated into the revised standards: C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education (2020).  These revised standards apply to all new programmes seeking accreditation and to all existing programmes&rsquo; first year intakes from September 2022.</p><p>The new Teaching Council Standards state that all primary level ITE programmes shall address, student teachers&rsquo; confidence and competence in Irish, including oral Irish, needs to be developed to a sufficient level to enable them to teach the Gaeilge primary curriculum.  (This includes, but is not limited to language learning as part of the Gaeltacht learning period). </p><p>Development of revised post-primary subject requirements by the Teaching Council also seek to ensure a meaningful Gaeltacht residency for teachers at that level.</p><p>A number of actions under the Policy for Gaeltacht Education are being implemented by my Department to increase the supply and Irish-language proficiency of Primary and Post-Primary teachers who can teach through the medium of Irish, at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. These include:  </p><p>- A new four-year Irish-medium B.Ed. for primary teachers, which has additional Irish-language entry and exit criteria, and which commenced in Marino Institute of Education in 2019, and </p><p>- A new two-year blended-learning Irish-medium M.Ed. in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht Education, also with additional Irish-language entry and exit criteria, for primary and post-primary teachers and principals, that commenced in Mary Immaculate College in 2018.</p><p>- Provision for two seconded teachers in the <i>M&aacute;istir Gairmi&uacute;il san Oideachas in NUI, Galway </i>for post-primary teachers with proficiency to teach through the medium of Irish and availability of COGG bursaries has boosted the uptake of post-primary teachers on this programme.</p><p>My Department also proposes to introduce a new Post-Primary PME blended-learning teacher education programme through the medium of Irish.</p><p>Following on from the publication of the Teacher Supply Action Plan, since 2019 HEIs have put in place a number of new four-year undergraduate ITE programmes, which aim to increase the supply of post-primary teachers of targeted subjects, including Irish. These programmes provide 120 new places for students annually, who on graduation will be qualified to teach Irish in post-primary schools, with the first graduates expected in 2023.  In addition to the new four-year programmes, my Department is currently planning for the introduction during 2021/22 of a new flexible programme to upskill post-primary teachers to teach Irish. I am also pleased that a new Level 9 part-time Certificate course for post-primary subject teachers in Irish-medium schools, Aonaid l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge or Gaeltacht schools, has recently commenced in Mary Immaculate College.</p><p>I also believe that it is important that we provide short term flexible supports to teachers who want to maintain or improve their level of Irish and I am glad that there are a range of these supports available via the Department funded Teacher Education Support Services, local Education Centres, summer courses and indeed programmes offered by other stakeholders such as the INTO, ETBI and school management bodies.</p><p>Engagement with the professional development supports and networks, that are available from the Department funded support services and from other bodies, can help teachers to improve their confidence and competence in Irish, as well as their pedagogy.</p><p>My Department through its teacher education funded support services, offers high quality and relevant continuing professional development (CPD) through the medium of Gaeilge to teachers and school leaders in a range of pedagogical, curricular, leadership and educational areas. Core CPD and school supports are provided as Gaeilge by the support services to schools which are operating through the medium of Irish.</p><p>My Department's is currently focusing on national delivery of the Primary Language Curriculum. A comprehensive continuing professional development programme is in place to support the implementation of the new Primary Language Curriculum. Teachers, as part of this professional development, receive advice on the use of different approaches to teach Irish and to use Irish as the medium of instruction across other aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>There are a range of models of CPD support that may be provided to schools such as face to face, on-line or blended learning which all result is varying costs. In general, a face to face event will attract costs for facilitators, venue cost, travel and subsistence and substitute costs. A one day face to face event for 30 teachers can be estimated at &euro;7,500 assuming substitute cover is made available for those teachers attending.</p></reply>

Music Generation has been co-funded by philanthropic funding, the Department of Education and Local Music Education Partnerships (LMEPs), in which Education and Training Boards and Local Authorities play a lead partner role. The Department of Education has allocated &euro;6,485,000 to Music Generation in 2021. Since its foundation Music Generation has grown nationally from an initial three areas, to 29 areas areas  in 2021. </p>  <p>  Music Generation programmes encompass a range of vocal, instrumental, ensemble, music technology and early years/experiential focuses, across multiple genres of music. Full details of programme participation, outputs and the work of the Music Generation National Development Office are outlined each year in Music Generation&rsquo;s Annual Reports.</p>  <p>  There are four Music Generation LMEP areas in Dublin City and County. These are Fingal, Dublin City, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin.  </p>  <p>  - Fingal is the newest Music Generation area to commence, with the Music Development Officer due to start in their role in mid-November 2021. </p>  <p>  - The Music Development Officer commenced in Dublin City in March 2021 and has been focused on operational set-up to date.

The condition of registration is that a TEQ appropriate for Further Education teaching must be completed with a period of three years. The Council accredits a number of programmes for Further Education teaching, further information on those is available on the Teaching Council website at:</p><p><i>www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/teacher-education/initial-teacher-education/professional-accreditation-of-programmes/further-education/</i></p><p>These programmes provide teachers with the professional knowledge, understanding and pedagogical skills required to carry out their teaching roles and responsibilities as a Further Education teacher. A licence as a music teacher is not deemed to be the equivalent of a teacher education qualification recognised for the purposes of registration with the Council. </p><p>It should be noted that after three years, if the registrant does not complete the TEQ, under the Teaching Council Act they must apply for an extension of time prior to the expiry date of their condition.  The granting of an extension request is at the discretion of the Council and is governed by Section 32 of the Teaching Council Act. All extensions are granted on the understanding that the registered teacher complies with the condition of their registration. </p><p>Under section 30 of the Teaching Council Acts, a teacher in a recognised school is required to be registered with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from Oireachtas-voted funds.</p><p>The Teaching Council does not have any remit in relation to the employment or deployment of teachers. Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board as employer are best placed to advise as to the application of Section 30 for teachers in the Limerick School of music.</p></reply>

This building was identified as a temporary location for the school for the next number of years pending the development of their permanent at school at Harcourt Terrace. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department reviewed the facilities in the Rathmines building to identify how best it could be used and whether it could support the co-location of a number of entities. Following this assessment, however, it was identified that the building had a number of severe limitations, in particular the limited number of toilets and the location of toilets within the building. Unfortunately, the layout of the building does not support the subdividing of the building for use by different users where there would be a need to separate those users, as would be the case if primary school-aged pupils were to share the building with adult students who would attend a college of further education. While there are a number of modular units located in a yard attached to the building, the primary school pupils would be using this yard as a play area. Again, it would not be appropriate to have primary-aged pupils and adult students sharing the one area.</p>  <p>  It is planned to use the property as a regional solution for a post-primary school for the Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 school planning area. </p>  <p>  Regarding the current overcrowding at Rathmines College of Further Education this is a matter for the City of Dublin Education Training Board (CDETB) in conjunction with SOLAS and my colleague the Minister for Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p></reply>

Once the consultation closes, a detailed analysis of all feedback will be conducted and an interim consultation report will be presented to NCCA Council in early 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to the consultation on the new draft Leaving Certificate specifications, the NCCA are undertaking an early enactment review of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 and L2 specifications. This review will provide teachers and students with opportunities to share their insights, experiences, and views on implementing the Junior Cycle Irish specifications to-date.  It is expected that the results of this review will be considered by the NCCA Council in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the consultation process and analysis of feedback, my Department will carefully consider the feedback received during the consultation process.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest primary school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  All children who are eligible and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p>  <p>  Children who apply for school transport, but who are not eligible, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. Due to the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme, the availability of concessionary transport varies from year to year based on the capacity on the buses running on all of the various routes and the number of eligible children accommodated on each route.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that one mainstream service operates into the school to whom the Deputy refers.  lt is a sixteen seat vehicle with 5 eligible pupils and 10 concessionary pupils onboard.  Eight concessionary pupils were not successsful in acquiring a ticket in the selection process.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that these pupils are not eligible for transport as they are not attending their closest school.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. </p><p>This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index.</p><p>This work involved an initial process of consultation by my Department with the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. Over the coming weeks there will be further consultation with relevant stakeholders to outline the components of the model. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.</p><p>The costing of DEIS supports vary from school to school depending on enrolment and the profile of a given school. A definitive breakdown of the numbers of schools to be supported will not be available until the current phase of work is completed.</p><p>The full list of supports available to DEIS schools is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Supporting-Information/Supports-to-DEIS-Schools.html</i><i></i></p></reply>

In the 2020/2021 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  This year I have extended measures to all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and who have applied and paid on time so that they will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  To date in the 2021/22 school year some 104,324 tickets have been issued for children availing of transport on the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes.  In addition services are operating or have been sanctioned to provide transport for some 15,800 children on the School Transport Scheme for children with special educational needs, giving a total of 120,124 children availing of transport services.  This figure is subject to change as Bus &Eacute;ireann continues to offer tickets where capacity exists once all eligible children have been accommodated. </p>  <p>  Based on an analysis conducted for phase 1 of the review of the School Transport Scheme it is projected that nationally numbers of children to avail of school transport will increase to a projected 125,220 children in 2022, including some 15,969 children on SEN transport services. </p>  <p>  The increased investment on the scheme is due in the main to the cost of contractors to cater for the increase in pupil numbers projected in 2022. In addition the expected increase of children requiring transport on the scheme for children with special educational needs will result in a subsequent increase in the number of School Bus Escorts required and this is factored into the additional costs for 2022. As these figures are projected on a national basis it is not possible to provide the information in tabular format as requested by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme earlier this year. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme,  its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group recently presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme will take place in the next phase of the review which is now underway. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

This follows a similar one point reduction in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedules in place for DEIS schools will also benefit from the one point reduction.

Voluntary Secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme are funded by way of per capita grants.</p>  <p>  At the core of these arrangements is reliance upon capitation as a key determinant of funding and enrolments are the main driver in the level of funding provided.  </p>  <p>  The capitation rates payable to Post-Primary schools in the Free Education scheme remain unchanged as the additional funding I secured in Budget 2022 is to rectify historical inconsistencies in the funding arrangements for Voluntary Secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme. </p>  <p>  Some equalisation measures have already been introduced to address these inconsistencies. It is estimated that up to &euro;21m has been provided in equalisation funding in the period up to 2009.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as agreed with the Joint Managerial Body (JMB),  future improvements in equalisation funding is to be directed in the first instance at the elimination of the School Salary grant deduction from the capitation payable to Voluntary Secondary Schools.  Therefore, Budget 2020 provided additional funding to cater for a 20% reduction in the School Salary Grant deduction from 1 September 2020. This brought the deduction down from &euro;563 to &euro;450.40 per whole-time equivalent teaching post.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to have secured further funding in Budget 2022 to complete the elimination of this deduction. This means that all of the Voluntary Secondary Schools in the Free Education Scheme will see capitation funding increase resulting in an estimated additional &euro;1.4 million being made available to these schools in 2022 and &euro;5.6 million in 2023.</p></reply>

This year my Department will spend over &euro;150 million on supports for schools targeted at supporting the educational outcomes of those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage. The DEIS Plan includes the allocation of additional resources, including enhanced book grants, to all DEIS schools, to improve learning outcomes.  </p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year:</p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. </p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way. </p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received. </p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website:<i>www.ncse.ie/for-schools</i></p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website: <i>www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</i></p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category so account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p><p>Policy advice has been requested from the NCSE on the specialist education placements is also expected in the coming months.</p></reply>

At post primary level the challenges appear to refer more to the recruitment of teachers of certain subjects, although the recruitment of substitute teachers is also an issue.</p>  <p>  A range of measures have been put in place to provide enhanced substitute cover in the context of Covid-19. These include a major expansion of the Primary Schools Substitute Teacher Supply Panels, which now employ almost 380 teachers and provide substitute cover to over 2,500 primary schools across the country. Further work is underway to ascertain if there are ways the operation of the panels can be enhanced to help with substitute teacher supply.</p>  <p>  The Supply Panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as Sub Seeker the national substitution portal service for primary and post primary schools, operated by the Irish Primary Principals Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p>  <p>  Measures are also underway to raise awareness of the availability of substitute work in primary schools. The Teaching Council has emailed over 111,000 teachers on its register, asking any who may be available for substitute work to register with Sub Seeker.</p>  <p>  My Department has also adjusted its payroll operational arrangements so that the restriction on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed as substitutes has been suspended and teachers who are job sharing are allowed to work additional hours.</p>  <p>  As in 2020/21, flexible school placement arrangements are being implemented to enhance the availability of post-primary Professional Master of Education (PME) student teachers to fill short term substitute vacancies. My Department and the Teaching Council are also planning to meet with the providers of primary initial teacher education (ITE) in the coming days to explore how flexibility in primary ITE programme delivery could facilitate additional substitute supply.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with stakeholders to analyse the demand for substitution and to identify means to improve the availability of substitutes at this time.</p>  <p>  The data sought by the Deputy is not readily available and will be forwarded to him directly.</p></reply>

This includes providing targeted measures to those most distant from the labour market, including women. </p>  <p>  In July of this year, I launched Pathways to Work 2021-2025; Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy and the overall framework for activation and employment support policy. The development of this strategy included an extensive consultation process. This included a series of regional events and a public consultation component, made up of an open call for submissions and an online survey open to all individuals and organisations who wished to contribute. Furthermore, my Department engaged bilaterally with other Government Departments and community and voluntary organisations. The Labour Market Advisory Council (LMAC) was also consulted during this process. </p>  <p>  The aim of Pathways to Work 2021-2025 is to assist people back to work as the economy and labour market recovers from COVID-19.  Men and women have equal access to any of my Department's active labour market programmes,  Pathways is designed to support those unemployed before the pandemic, those looking to return to work or join the workforce and those facing additional barriers to work, in order to promote better employment outcomes for all.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the strategy&rsquo;s fourth strand, &lsquo;Working for All - Leaving No One Behind&rsquo; contains a number of specific commitments to increase labour market participation of lone parents, and others most distant from the labour market. In addition, the strategy recognises that there are those who, while not traditionally considered unemployed, are not in employment but would like support in getting a job. This includes workforce returners and those with caring responsibilities, many of whom are women. Pathways to Work also commits to developing and operating &lsquo;returner&rsquo; programmes to encourage and support people who left the workforce and have been outside of the workforce for some time to take up employment.</p>  <p>  Given the range of supports provided for under Pathways to Work, I do not plan to develop a new activation plan at present. I am satisfied that the Pathways to Work strategy supports the labour market participation of all groups in society including women. However, it should be noted that due to the dynamic context in which Pathways to Work was drafted and launched, the strategy will undergo a mid-term review in 2023. This will provide an opportunity for us to take stock, assess progress and set new targets and commitments for the remainder of the strategy&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;8.8 billion.</p>  <p>  Last week the number of PUP payments fell below 100,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic, to just over 97,100.  This milestone reached represents a drop of almost 85% in the number of customers who are currently receiving the payment compared to over 602,000 in May 2020, during the height of the pandemic. It is therefore important that standard social welfare terms are re-introduced in a controlled and considered manner.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, the PUP is  changing using a tapered approach from September 2021 until February 2022 to align it with standard jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  Further rate changes will take place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022. As PUP customers move on to the &euro;203 rate, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms.</p>  <p>I have deferred the commencement of this transition process in line with the publication of the Government's Roadmap "Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting". All affected customers, including those self- employed, will continue to receive their PUP payment until 26th   October after which the process of their transition to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will begin.</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available to the self-employed who are working in a reduced or limited capacity. A self-employed person exiting the PUP scheme and who is working in their business for up to 24 hours per week may apply for the Part Time Job Incentive for Self -employed. Recipients receive a payment of &euro;128.60 per week and there is no income limit applied. The extension of the Part Time Job Incentive to self-employed people will continue to be available until the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, a self- employed person who is trading at a reduced level may be eligible for support under the means tested Jobseekers Allowance Scheme subject to satisfying the statutory scheme conditions.  </p>  <p>  I should also advise the Deputy that the &euro;1,000 Covid-19 Enterprise Support Grant to assist self -employed people to restart their business will continue to be available to self-employed people closing their PUP claims until the end of 2021. A self-employed person closing their PUP claim to reopen their business will be able to avail of this grant even if they have previously claimed it as part of an earlier reopening of their business in 2020. To date almost 10,000 applications have been awarded since the scheme was launched last year with a total of over &euro;9 million paid to grant recipients towards the costs of reopening their businesses. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for policy relating to supports for businesses.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

This estimate is based on an additional 79,900 claims qualifying for fuel allowance.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to allow all those in receipt of Carer's Allowance to receive the fuel allowance payment would represent a fundamental change to the nature of the scheme and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. The fuel allowance payment would no longer be a household or means tested payment that is targeted at those who are most likely to require additional help over the winter period.</p>  <p>  While Carer's Allowance is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance, a person in receipt of Carer's Allowance may avail of the fuel allowance payment in certain circumstances.  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a carer will very often live with and care for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test, if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse / civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren).</p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  The payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department has been given clear legal advice from the Chief State Solicitors Office and the Attorney General that this process cannot continue and there needs to be competitive procurement for future public employment services. In addition, my Department is responsible for ensuring good governance of employment service provision, which requires greater oversight and enhanced visibility of service provision.  </p>  <p>  My Department cannot ignore this legal advice. Nonetheless, officials are striving to ensure the new model does not create any barriers to the community and voluntary sectors or inhibit their ability to submit a high-standard tender for future services </p>  <p>  Phase two of this process, to commence shortly, will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State. The learnings from the limited phase one procurement, currently underway, will be factored into the finalisation of the phase two procurement process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-19a.1591.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021101900089#WRCC03400"><p>The Department completed the Poverty Impact Assessment of age related rates of jobseekers for young people aged 18-24 years and it was published in July 2021 on the Governments website. A copy of the report was provided to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development, and the Islands at that time.</p>  <p>  In September 2021, the rate of unemployment for young persons under 25 was 17% using the traditional measure or almost 20% when we use the CSO&rsquo;s COVID-19 adjusted measure. The latter rate, which includes those on the PUP, has fallen sharply from its 2021 peak of 56% in January. Furthermore, this rate fell 6 percentage points from 26% in August as students, no longer eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment since last month, will no longer be included in the estimate. Full-time students are not traditionally included in unemployment estimates as they are not considered part of the labour force.</p>  <p>  In addition, as the reopening of our economy and society has continued, the number of people under 25 in receipt of PUP has declined significantly, falling by 92% since the 2021 peak in February to just under 9,500 last week. I expect this trend to continue as the restrictions are eased further. In May of this year one in four people  out of work as a result of Covid-19 were aged under 25. The number has now fallen to one in ten.</p>  <p>  These trends show that young people are among the most resilient groups in society and, once the opportunities are available, youth employment recovers very quickly.</p>  <p>  The current approach to rates of payment for young Jobseekers allowance recipients was introduced in 2009 to encourage young unemployed people to participate in employment, education and training programmes. Although the basic rate is &euro;112.70 per week for young people up to and including 24 year olds, it increases to the standard rate of &euro;203 if a young jobseeker participates on an education or training programme. Where they participate on the new Work Placement Experience Programme, their weekly rate is increased to &euro;306. I have announced as part of Budget 2022 that the core weekly rates of payment will increase by &euro;5 per week from January 2022, including that for young jobseekers which will increase the rate to &euro;117.70.</p>  <p>  There are many opportunities for young unemployed people - the Department has introduced a series of targeted measures under the Pathways to Work strategy targeted at young people including ring-fencing 4,000 places on the Work Placement Experience Programme and providing 50,000 additional further education and training places.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

More precise allocations across the youth subheads are currently being considered by my Department and details will be shared as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between 2016 and now moving into 2022, the annual current youth funding available to my Department will have increased from &euro;51.9 million to &euro;71.79 million. Including capital allocations, the total funding next year will be &euro;73 million.</p>  <p>  The additional funding secured for Youth Services is particularly important given the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has had on young people. This additional funding will allow us to re-engage young people in youth services, re-engage and train volunteers, and provide new youth services where needed.</p>  <p>  It is now more critical than ever that our young people are supported as they experience the social, economic, physical and mental health impacts of the pandemic. In recognition of the vital role played by youthwork services in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period. This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people. The increased funding in 2022 will enable DCEDIY to offer more supports to existing services, to help them reach more young people, and will enable the introduction of brand new services across the country.</p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic, I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint.</p></reply>

Ireland played an active role in the drafting of the text and related discussions. The European Child Guarantee aims to break the cycle of poverty and social exclusion across generations. </p>  <p>  The Guarantee seeks to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services. It calls on Member States to guarantee for children in need, free access to early childhood education and care; education (including school-based activities); and healthcare; and to ensure effective access healthy nutrition, a healthy meal each school day and adequate housing.</p>  <p>  The Guarantee also aims to promote equal opportunity for children at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and to break cycles of inter-generational disadvantage. In 2020, some 18 million children in the EU lived in households at risk of poverty of social exclusion. The plan suggests a target for the EU to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social inclusion by at least 15 million by 2030 (of which at least 5 million would be children).</p>  <p>  The EU Child Guarantee offers countries guidance on integrated strategies to tackle child poverty and promote children&rsquo;s well-being. It goes beyond welfare and labour market policies to promote access to quality services and the active participation of children themselves. It further highlights the importance of EU cohesion policy in mobilising reform. </p>  <p>  Member State Governments will submit to the Commission a national action plan on how the Child Guarantee is to be progressed by mid-March 2022. Another key part of the Child Guarantee will be the development of an enabling policy framework, to deliver on milestones set out in the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  EU funds are available to support measures addressing child poverty, social exclusion and, by extension, the implementation of the Child Guarantee. Where specific proposals to address child poverty under the objectives of the Child Guarantee are accepted for funding by the Commission, details can and will, of course, be made available to the Deputy. </p></reply>

Larger services, and those operating longer hours, will receive higher funding. </p>  <p>  - Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs of ELC for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements. </p>  <p>  - Additional funding will be available for provision that is led by a staff member with a degree-level qualification.</p>  <p>  The &euro;69m estimate for the four months of 2022 includes provision to support higher quality services by enabling providers to better attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff; establish career structures; and introduce or improve other factors that contribute to high-quality early learning and childcare, such as non-contact time, planning, training and curriculum implementation.  </p>  <p>  A central objective of the new funding is to support Programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) to determine minimum rates of pay for workers, as well as terms and conditions of employment. The new funding stream is therefore largely contingent on an ERO being agreed. </p>  <p>  The precise implications of the funding for staff terms and conditions depends on the agreement by the JLC. However, I believe that the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay and the development of career frameworks. These are important points to improve quality in the sector, by supporting the retention and progression of staff.</p>  <p>  The new funding stream will help to ensure that services remain sustainable in the context of a commitment not to increase fees. For this reason, Core Funding will also contribute towards cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities and rent) as well as adminstration.</p>  <p>  The new funding stream is a strategic, comprehensive approach to supporting providers in the costs of delivery of quality services, while ensuring that parents feel the affordability effects of other schemes. This package marks the beginning of an important and transformative multi-annual investment programme and achieves significant progress on the commitment to increase spending on ELC and SAC to approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028.</p></reply>

The NCS provides financial support to help parents meet the cost of childcare and to support better outcomes for children.  Subsidies can be income assessed or universal.</p>  <p>  Whereas up to now, the universal subsidy was only available to parents of children prior to them beginning the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) preschool programme (around age 3), the changes announced in Budget 2022 will extend eligibility for the universal subsidy to children of all ages up to 15. </p>  <p>  The cost of the increase in eligibility for the universal subsidy in NCS to all children under the age of 15 was estimated using the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH microsimulation model. This model provides estimates of policy changes, using data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions. The model assumes no change in demand arising from the policy change. It also assumes that there will be full uptake of subsidies among those who are eligible, for the full number of hours of reported use.  Up to 40,000 children are predicted to benefit from this change.  The cost of the measure, to be introduced from Q3 is &euro;5.4m for 2022.</p>  <p>  The second change to NCS announced in Budget 2022 is the discontinuation of the practice of deducting hours spent in ECCE or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours. </p>  <p>  Currently, where both parents in a household are in work or study, eligible families can receive a subsidy for up to 45 hours (enhanced hours) per week and, for households where a parent is not in work or study they can receive up to 20 hours (standard hours) per week of subsidy.  Where a child is in pre-school, ECCE or school these hours are subtracted from their entitlement to NCS subsidised hours. With this change, parents can avail of all these hours regardless of time spent in school or ECCE.  </p>  <p>  This measure will be costed at &euro;4m in 2022. It is expected that this will reach approximately 3,000 children who are currently on standard hours, utilising an additional 16-17 hours on average as a result of this change.</p></reply>

This building is leased by the OPW - the rent is paid directly by the OPW and not by my Department. </p><p>My Department has occupied Montague Court since October 2020 and pays rent for the use of this building. The table below shows the rent paid to date in relation to this office space. Please note rent is paid 3 months in advance and Department of Justice, from whom we took over this office space, had already paid for quarter 4 of 2020.  Therefore the rent paid by my Department in 2020 relates to quarter 1 of 2021.</p><p>My Department previously occupied an office on Mespil Road from June 2011 until May 2018. This building was leased by the OPW, and the OPW paid the rent for that building also.</p><p>In addition, a Commission of Investigation which falls under the remit of this Department operated from 73 Baggot Street Lower, Dublin 2 from January 2015 to March 2021.<b></b>This building was leased by the OPW, who also paid rent for that building.</p><p>My Department also had a number of staff co-located with Pobal at 100 Mount Street from September 2017 to December 2019 working on the development of the National Childcare Scheme.

The mission of the scheme is to provide out-of-school supports to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people in their communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential.  </p>  <p>  Separately, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are funded by my Department through an ETB Youth Grant. My Department currently allocates &euro;4.7 million to enable ETBs to fulfil governance and oversight responsibilities across multiple youth funding schemes, including UBU Your Place Your Space, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, the LGBTI+ Initiative, Youth Information Centres and bespoke youth related schemes that are approved for a particular year. This Department has Service Level Agreements in place with each individual ETB to ensure the strong governance of Exchequer grant funding. The funding outlined above does not fund individual posts within ETBs, but is rather a contribution towards ETB costs in fulfilling their statutory youth work responsibilities. While the cost is not disaggregated in the manner requested by the Deputy each ETB will employ a range of staff deemed necessary to carry out these statutory functions. ETB Ireland advised in March 2021 that there are some 26 youth officers, 7 liaison officers and 7 development officers employed in ETBs dedicated to youth work functions. These staff would be supported by clerical grades and report to senior management.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for the operation of the ETBI Youth Support Service. This service has been established to support all ETBs in the delivery of their youth work function, specifically to enhance the capacity of ETBs with respect to their role in relation to youth funding schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department does not collate data on the number of audits carried out in youth services by ETBs and other bodies in the manner requested. This is a local management matter as the responsibility for the mid-level governance of the scheme rests with the ETBs. ETBs are obliged under the terms of the SLA with my Department to report any matters as appropriate as part of the governance arrangements.</p></reply>

The purpose of &lsquo;play-pods&rsquo; is to limit the number of people a child has contact with, and to support close, positive interactions between children and their adult caregivers. This system also reduces the amount of contact adults have with each other.</p><p>The HSE has not given any date for removal of its advice on the use of play-pods.</p><p>It is important to note that vaccination of staff will not automatically remove the need for play-pods or other public health measures as for example children under 12 are not currently vaccinated.</p><p>ELC and SAC services are provided by private enterprises, either privately owned or operated by community organisations. ELC and SAC service providers are responsible for establishing their own policy and procedures for the implementation of the public health guidance for the sector.</p><p>The guidance does not place a requirement on ELC and SAC service providers to limit openinghours. Opening hours are a matter for the provider in the context of their own setting and operational capabilities.</p><p>My Department acknowledges that implementation of public health guidance by providers may impact on families. However, the objective of the guidance is to reduce the risk of infection within settings in order to keep settings open for all children and families.</p><p>The guidance is kept under review by the HSE and my Department and is updated in line with the latest public health advice.</p></reply>

Section 59 of the Act provides for similar arrangements through a grant or contribution in kind to non-profit organisations for services supplemental to those provided by the Agency. Such services are commissioned under a formal Service Level Agreement and assist Tusla to fulfil its statutory responsibilities and deliver on the Agency's strategic objectives.  </p>  <p>  Each organisation funded under these arrangements operate independently of Tusla. Each is responsible for the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which individuals are employed. Section 56(14) of the Act of 2013 stipulates that &lsquo;an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014 some of the organisations now funded under section 56 were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. In October 2018 the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reached agreement between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 39 organisations. Pay restoration in relation to organisations funded through section 39 was applied to organisations who met certain specific criteria. The criteria related to the organisations rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The criteria included only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process. Pay restoration was limited and solely applicable to those organisations included in the initial WRC agreement. This process has reached a final resolution and there is no scope to revisit eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with colleagues in Government, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of voluntary organisations and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland. I greatly appreciate the tremendous contribution made by the Community and Voluntary sector in supporting Tusla to deliver on its challenging mandate.</p></reply>

However some permissions do not convey such entitlements.  Determination of these permissions are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and are outside the remit of my Department.</p><p>In relation to funding under the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p><p>The nationality requirements for the Student Grant Scheme are set out in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2021. To qualify for a student grant, the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations. Further information in relation to the nationality requirements are available from SUSI's website: <i>susi.ie/nationality-criteria/</i></p><p>Permission to remain in the State on the basis of a Stamp 4 Visa, of itself, does not meet the nationality requirements of the Student Grant Scheme 2021. However, article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 provides for a review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted one of the permission to remain criterion provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for SUSI to determine. However, a comprehensive appeals process is in place for any student who is of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case. Details of same are available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: <i>susi.ie/quick-links/appealing-your-grant-decision/</i></p><p>Under the Departments Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including the separate residency and nationality/citizenship requirements of the scheme. </p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding they must pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution. Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and therefore the criteria governing the level of fee payable by students (EU or non-EU) is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme and the Free Fees Initiative, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, </p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to managing their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection obligations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of any groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 38(3) (c)) and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements are in place since 2006.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. When enacted, this legislation will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that a review of the scheme is planned to commence shortly and the threshold will be examined as part of that review.

We want people to feel safe and be safe in Dublin, whether they live or work in Dublin or want to visit and enjoy our capital city.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister for Justice recently met with the Garda authorities, Dublin business owners and local representatives to discuss recent anti-social behaviour the city centre. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as at bank holidays weekends.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner has also established Operation Soteria to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. </p>  <p>  The operation is based upon five principles for implementation:</p>  <p>  1. commitment to protecting people and communities; </p>  <p>  2. awareness and education as a crime prevention technique; </p>  <p>  3. policing operational efficiency;</p>  <p>  4. location management by working in partnership; and </p>  <p>  6. offender management.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p>  <p>  Two current subgroups of the forum have been set up to examine particular issues on knife crime, which met on 26 September, and another on the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Similar sub-groups can also be established for other relevant issues as they arise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the Local Community Safety Partnership pilot which is underway in the north inner city. Local Community Safety Partnerships are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues  of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationwide to all local authority areas after the pilot phase of two years. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that a new Youth Justice Strategy for 2021 &ndash; 2027 was published on 15 April last. In line with international best practice, a key principle of the new Youth Justice Strategy is providing as many opportunities as possible to enable young people to change direction in their lives and adopt more positive behaviours. </p>  <p>  The Strategy includes the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release. </p>  <p>  The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Youth Diversion Projects and promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives. Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill was approved by Government today will be published shortly.

There is a pathway mapped for this legislation progressing which will facilitate the Authority being established and operational in 2023.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, &euro;500,000 has been allocated to meet the costs of appointing the CEO designate as well as non-pay related costs in establishing the Authority. This is added to the initial seed funding of &euro;200,000 in Budget 2021. This &euro;700,000 will cover start-up costs including accommodation and professional services.  </p></reply>

This fund will reflect the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau and other agencies by using money seized from the proceeds of crime to support investment in community safety projects. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay of &euro;2m. </p>  <p>  Funding will be allocated via a process similar to that successfully used at present to distribute Dormant Accounts Funding. A call for funding proposals will issue seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, such as the new Local Community Safety Partnerships &ndash; pilots of which are in place in North Inner City Dublin, Waterford and Longford &ndash; and the Drogheda Implementation Board, as well as similar entities nationwide. </p>  <p>  Applications will be assessed against criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best and to avoid duplication with other services. These criteria for allocating funding are currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  The fund will be open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for in other funds managed by Departments and agencies. This will ensure that the fund supports initiatives from communities themselves and does not create duplication with other schemes and funds. </p>  <p>  No existing initiative will be discontinued due to the fund's establishment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, all monies seized by CAB are remitted to the Central Fund of the Exchequer after the appropriate statutory time frame under the Proceeds of Crime Act; currently seven years must elapse from date of seizure to remittance to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the identification, tracing, freezing, and ultimate confiscation of criminal assets rests with a number of different agencies and statutory bodies. These include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, as well as Revenue, the Chief State Solicitors Office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts.</p></reply>

These schemes provide avenues for Afghan nationals to seek protection and for eligible family members living in Ireland to seek to have their close family members granted permission to reside in Ireland, where the relevant criteria are met. More than 740 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year. </p><p>The Government has approved an additional initiative: the special Afghan Admission Programme, which will provide places for up to 500 Afghan family members.

Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, COVID-19 restrictions on the Garda Training College in Templemore constrained recruitment and training for periods over the last 18 months.  However, I am glad to confirm that 450 Garda&iacute; will be recruited this year and the funding provided for next year fully supports the sustained recruitment of Garda members and staff. </p>  <p>  In particular, the funding announced last week includes provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - an additional 1,200 personnel. This increase in the number of Garda members and staff will deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and improved services to the public generally.  Redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year, thus allowing highly trained Garda&iacute; to focus on frontline policing duties.  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including to specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that a recruitment plan for 2022 is currently being developed to manage the recruitment processes for Garda Members and Garda Staff roles.

A submission on the review was received by the then Minister for Justice and Equality from the Department's Secretary General on 14 May 2018. This submission was subsequently approved by the then Minister on 15 May 2019. As previously stated, the review in question did not ultimately proceed. The failure to follow up on this decision was due to an administrative oversight.</p>  <p>  As previously stated to the Deputy, it was also intended that the O&rsquo;Farrell family would be sent a copy of the terms of reference for the review, as well as a copy of the original Courts Service report. However, due to the same administrative oversight, this did not occur.</p>  <p>  These matters came to light in the process of compiling records for a Freedom of Information request. Following consideration of the matter, it was decided that the most efficient and expedient way of dealing with this oversight was to bring the matter to the attention of Judge Haughton, who had already commenced his independent scoping exercise into matters relating to the death of Mr Shane O'Farrell in February 2019. In response to a request, Judge Haughton agreed that the matter referred to in the Courts Service report could be dealt with in the context of his scoping exercise.</p></reply>

The COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report is particularly pertinent in that regard and progressing the implementation of its recommendations is ongoing. Findings of this report as well as other examinations throughout the pandemic confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings.  The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing homes depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided extensive support to the Nursing Home Sector since the start of the pandemic. The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic. Up to &euro;134m for the Scheme was made available for 2020 and 2021.  In recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak. </p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to longer-term reform is underlined in Budget 2022 with &euro;17.6 million allocated for the further implementation of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report, with a focus on the establishment of multidisciplinary Community Support Teams, safe staffing framework piloting and the safeguarding of residents.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant has increased in Ireland and this poses ongoing risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk. The Government is continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one. The establishment and parameters of any broader review or evaluation of the State&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be a matter for Government to decide on at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>On the 7<sup>th</sup>October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. </p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning, the waiting times for pain management at Sligo University Hospital in each of the years 2018 to 2020 and to date in 2021, is outlined in the document below.</p></reply>

The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with plans for further increases in future years.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

One of the report&rsquo;s recommendations is that a compensation scheme is established to deal with certain vaccine damage claims.</p>  <p>  On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board (HRB) carried out an evidence review on vaccine injury redress programmes in other jurisdictions and this was completed in March 2019.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group&rsquo;s report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Government Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of any proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation, and work to advance policy development in this regard is underway in my Department.</p></reply>

Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice. In relation to consideration of any age changes, such as extending the age of any of the screening programmes, it is vital we remember that screening is a population health measure. It is not an individual diagnostic test.  The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>I am pleased to advise that the NSAC is currently finalising plans for its first &lsquo;annual call&rsquo; which will be announced in the coming weeks. Applications for proposals for new population based screening programmes and modifications to existing programmes, such changes in the age of those eligible for screening, will be welcomed from the public as well as the HSE, health professionals and other professional bodies.  Further information on the 'annual call' will be published on the NSAC website in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

The Report sets out current levels of service, models of service provision and the consultation process undertaken with patients, advocates, ophthalmic staff and representative bodies. It also highlights the limitations of the current model of service delivery and sets out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be delivered in a primary care setting. The Report estimates that 60% of existing outpatient activity could be moved to primary care thus enabling hospital services to focus on patients who require more specialist diagnostics or treatments.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology has developed a model of care which details how the realignment of eye services from the acute hospitals to the community will be undertaken. The recommendations from the PCESRG Report also complement the Model of Care.</p>  <p>  The PCESRG Report remains current and the temporary arrangements currently required for processing of some ophthalmic patients from Donegal in Sligo Hospital are not aligned with the long-term objectives outlined therein. The HSE has advised that work is currently underway to increase the capacity of ophthalmic services in Donegal.</p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing a number of measures under the PCESRG Report. Included in current priorities is transferring the care of children aged 8+ years to the care of local private optometrists, creating a new role of Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist, and recruiting additional Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists to other CHOs.</p></reply>

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.   </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.</p>  <p>  The cyberattack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients.</p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, as this relates to operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>On the 7<sup>th</sup>October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons on the waiting list to see a consultant paediatric nephrologist at CHI Temple Street has been provided to my Department by the NTPF is outlined in the attached document.</p></reply>

I am very cognisant of the paramount importance of dignity and respect for these parents who have experienced the loss of a child.  I am committed to ensuring that there is learning across the health service to prevent such events happening again. </p>  <p>  Within the public health service, when an incident occurs, it is important that the health service where the incident occurred is responsible for ensuring that the incident is appropriately investigated, so that the service can learn from what went wrong to improve services in the future. </p>  <p>  The HSE and South/South West Hospital Group have advised my Department that this incident is being managed in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework. This incident was escalated to the hospital&rsquo;s Safety Incident Management Team (SIMT) when it was identified. Following an initial assessment, the SIMT commissioned two types of review: a Systems Analysis Review (with external subject matter expertise) and a Regional Perinatal Service Requirement Review</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Systems Analysis Review is to find out what happened and why, and what can be done to reduce the risk of it happening again. This review should be completed by early November and my Department will engage with the HSE regarding the implementation of recommendations arising. The review findings and recommendations will be shared with the wider HSE for learning. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Perinatal Service Requirement Review the HSE advise that a status report from the Regional Perinatal Services Requirement Review is expected within 4 weeks. </p>  <p>  My Department is advised that the HSE, South/South West Hospital Group, Cork University Hospital and Cork University Maternity Hospital have apologised to the bereaved families and very much regret the incident. The HSE informed my Department that open disclosure occurred with the parents, and, in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework, the families have been encouraged to participate in the ongoing review process to ensure that their experience is incorporated so that there is learning and improvement from this incident.</p>  <p>  My Department is advised that at the time that the incident was identified, all families were offered the support of the bereavement and pregnancy loss service that have supported these families prior to this issue.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the HSE in relation to progress on this matter.   </p></reply>

Under this programme, adult GMS patients, those who hold a medical card or GP visit card, with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes are eligible to be managed as part of the programme by their GP.</p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement introduced the chronic disease management programme for GMS patients who have one or more specific chronic diseases, of which Type 2 Diabetes is one. The structured programme commenced in 2020 and is being rolled out to all adult GMS patients over four years (2020 to 2023). This year the programme has been rolled out to those aged 65 years and over. The chronic disease management programme will replace the Diabetes cycle of care programme as it is rolled out.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependents may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  There is currently no plan to extend type 2 diabetes care under the chronic disease management programme to patients who do not hold a medical or GP visit card.</p>  <p>  While Type 2 diabetic patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card are not eligible under the Diabetes cycle of care or chronic disease management programmes, diabetes is one of the conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme. Under this scheme, patients with diabetes can receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness free of charge, regardless of whether they hold a medical card.</p></reply>

The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff.

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy. </p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted and sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s). Where the Court grants a Parental Order in respect in respect of a child born as a result of a surrogacy agreement, the Court will send a copy of the Parental Order to an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir who can issue the necessary certificate. </p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for the Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the next few months to finalise this complex legislation. </p>  <p>  The question of whether provision should be made for the retrospective assignment of parentage in respect of children already born through surrogacy arrangements raises complex legal issues that come under the remit of a number of Government Departments and which will require detailed examination.</p></reply>

Due to the impact of Covid-19 and the pauses in screening in 2020 and again earlier this year, BreastCheck appointments have been delayed. It will take approximately 3 years to get through this current screening round, when it normally takes about 2 years.  However, this is still within international norms.</p>  <p>  October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and BreastCheck is running a campaign which encourages women to be breast aware, know the symptoms of breast cancer and the risk factors for developing breast cancer. The campaign also explains about the impact of Covid-19 on services and provides advice for women about managing their screening appointments.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan on Covid-19 identified the continued provision of cancer care as a priority. Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).</p>  <p>  All Symptomatic Breast Disease (SBD) clinics remained open and accepting referrals during the Covid-19 pandemic. In light of Covid, clinical priority was necessarily given to referrals triaged as urgent. Symptomatic Breast Disease clinics had to reduce capacity in line with guidelines on social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures.   </p>  <p>  The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment.</p>  <p>  - from January&ndash;September this year, GP e-referrals for breast cancer are at 130% of 2019 (pre-Covid) activity; and   </p>  <p>  - attendances at urgent Symptomatic Breast Disease clinics from January&ndash;August 2021 (16,211) are at 115% of 2019 levels (14,127).  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m was allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. Additional funding of &euro;12m has also been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support.</p>  <p>  I have now secured a further &euro;20m in Budget 2022 to progress the delivery of the National Cancer Strategy and this will have a significant impact on access to cancer diagnostics, treatment and support to patients across their cancer journey.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government also commits to increase and support drug testing services, particularly at festivals. </p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with the Dept of Health, established a Working Group to review evidence in relation to drug trends and health responses applicable to the night-time economy and drug checking provision to help inform recommendations and to develop implementation plans to address these areas. The group was comprised of stakeholders from across the sector, which was intentionally broad in order to reflect the reality that this issue impacts on a number of Departments, agencies and drug user groups in Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Forensic Science Ireland attended meetings in an advisory capacity. </p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group was published in September. It contains a series of recommendations which will inform future direction in this area, one of which includes a pilot project to implement and evaluate drug monitoring strategies through a &lsquo;back of house&rsquo; system. </p>  <p>  This system involves festival attendees discard of substances in a secure location for analysis. Following analysis on compounds, risk communication strategies can be implemented in the event of substances appearing that pose an extra threat to life. This would also provide market surveillance and may provide health benefits that could improve public health and harm minimisation responses. </p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s report states that drug checking initiatives need to be part of a holistic process, embedded within a tailored structure so that analysis is not conducted in isolation and is coupled with other appropriate harm reduction measures such as brief interventions, counselling, onward referral, data gathering exercises and on-going drug market monitoring for health services. When implemented as part of a wider structure, drug analysis can engage with hard-to-reach groups, identify particularly dangerous substances and support people who use drugs to reduce the harms to their health.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations in the working group report, I secured additional funding to expand harm reduction responses to high-risk drug use associated with the night-time economy in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  As some of its recommendations pertain to a variety of Government Departments and State agencies, I will engage with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to consider the next steps.</p></reply>

The HSE has worked jointly with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other partner educational organisations to offer an expanded range of walk-in vaccination clinics, in existing vaccination clinic locations and in temporary pop-up vaccination clinics in a range of third-level educational settings.</p>  <p>  The aim was to maximise vaccine uptake in those who have not yet availed of vaccination, including international students. The focus was on accessibility and positive promotion of vaccination, which is supported through a dedicated national and local communications campaign.</p>  <p>  The campaign involved 30 third-level institutions. Temporary vaccination sites were set up in 15 sites in total, serving 20 higher educational sites. In addition, 7 existing HSE Central Vaccination Clinics (CVCs) are located on, or close to third-level educational institutions. This has allowed an additional 10 higher educational institutions to conveniently access vaccination at existing vaccination sites.</p>  <p>  As of 5 October, 2,356 vaccines have been delivered at third-level pop-up sites. 979 vaccines were delivered in CVC walk-in sites. In total 3,335 were delivered. The pop-ups are primarily aimed at third-level students and staff but walk-ins are also welcomed.</p></reply>

The report undertook an analysis of expenditure on drugs and alcohol across government departments and agencies and made a number of findings and conclusions on the gaps in measuring and assessing expenditure.</p>  <p>  The report is the first to estimate unlabelled expenditure on problem drug use, finding that approximately &euro;87m is spent annually dealing with the medical and legal consequences of drug use. Productivity losses associated with drug use are estimated to be in the region of &euro;61m per annum. Using a longitudinal approach to assess the net value of current and future unlabelled expenditure and productivity costs due to drug use, the combined estimates rises to over &euro;650m. </p>  <p>  The report found that labelled expenditure to address drug and alcohol use exceeds &euro;200m per annum. It was not possible to breakdown labelled expenditure by health and criminal justice responses. It was similarly not possible to breakdown expenditure by goal in the national drugs strategy. As such, an assessment of what was achieved for such expenditure was not possible. </p>  <p>  Addressing the limitations of datasets and performance indicators identified in the report are necessary first steps to improve monitoring and evaluation of the national drugs strategy and public expenditure on drug and alcohol programmes more generally. </p>  <p>  I am committed to addressing the the report's conclusions and recommendations. These issues will be addressed under the new structures I am putting in place to implement the strategic priorities 2021-2025 under for the national drugs strategy.  </p></reply>

Dental services were reduced during the pandemic as access to dental services was restricted and some HSE staff were redeployed to testing and tracing as part of the HSE&rsquo;s response to the pandemic. There has also been a reduction in the numbers of dentists participating in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), which provides dental services to medical card holders.</p>  <p>  The reduction in the number of dentists holding a DTSS  contract has resulted in some medical card holders, in some areas, experiencing a problem in accessing a service. In these instances, the local HSE services on the ground (i.e the HSE Public Dental Service) will assist any person who is  experiencing such a problem. The needs of anybody in urgent need of care and unable to secure a service in private dental practices is being addressed through the HSE public dental service.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and in the HSE have engaged with the Irish Dental Association with a view to addressing issues around the provision of services to medical card holders and that process of engagement is continuing.  Additional funding of &euro;10 million has been provided in Budget 2022, on top of a provision of &euro;56 million for the Existing Level of Services.</p>  <p>  The future approach to oral health service provision is being aligned with the goals and objectives of Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy (2019). The aim of the policy is to develop a model of care that will enable preventative approaches to be prioritised, improve access, and support interventions appropriate to current and future oral health needs.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>On the 7<sup>th</sup>October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. </p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning, the outpatient waiting times at Wexford General Hospital in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to date in 2021, by year and specialty in wait time bands of up to three, six, 12, 15 and 18 months, up to two years and over two years, is outlined in the attached documents.

This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and including representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It will take the learnings from the achievements of the Vaccine Taskforce to inform the plan.   </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250 million is being provided in Budget 2022 to improve access to care across the health system.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last nineteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.</p>  <p>  The cyber-attack in May 2021 in particular, caused significant disruption to the orthopaedic service and all services across the Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland Hospital Group.  Children's Health Ireland advise that without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.</p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.</p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients.</p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.</p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.</p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. </p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.  </p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support is scheduled to commence in November 2021 in CHO 8  (Longford / West Meath).  Recruitment issues associated with backfilling of posts has impacted on release of interRAI Care Coordinators in CHO 2 (Galway), 4 (South Lee) and 7 (Dublin West). This has necessitated phased introduction of pilot sites however it is expected that all will be fully operational by January 2022. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to inform legislative and funding decisions in relation to the statutory home support scheme. </p>  <p>  130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs and recruitment for these posts is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This additional allocation will be maintained in 2022. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.  Data which has been provided since the cyber-attack is provisional and subject to change.  At the end of August 2021, the preliminary data indicates that about 13.2 million home support hours had been provided to 53,905 people. This is about 2 million more hours compared to the same period last year. </p></reply>

While a significant proportion of infections are occurring in the unvaccinated population (both those who are ineligible by age, as well as those who are eligible but have not taken up the opportunity to be vaccinated) the current force of infection is resulting in a significant number of infections in older, vaccinated people. Recent surveillance data in Ireland indicate that the proportion of all hospital admissions who are not fully vaccinated is high in proportion to the number of non-vaccinated people that remain in the population. As of 12th October 2021, at least 33% of hospitalised cases of COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated while the number of unvaccinated patients in ICU remains high, representing 64% of ICU admissions. The recent increase in COVID-19 incidence in Ireland continues to be closely monitored by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p></reply>

The six-month progress report, published last month, indicated that of the 112 deliverables, 109 were on track or progressing with minor challenges. I would expect that progress would continue at pace in 2022, supported by the allocation in Budget 2022 of &euro;21 billion, the biggest ever investment in Ireland&rsquo;s Health and Social Care Services to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  A new Programme Board is being established to ensure that the drive for universal healthcare is fully embedded in both the Department of Health and the HSE. It will be co-chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE and will also comprise senior members of the Management Board and Executive Management Teams. It is in the process of being constituted and is expected to have its first meeting in the near future. The Board will report to me. The Cabinet Committee on Health will continue to report as appropriate. </p></reply>

Research into international best practice has been completed. Policy options have been drafted. Consultation with stakeholders including patients, clinicians, policymakers, and hospital group and community healthcare organisations officials has taken place. An advisory group of clinicians and patient representatives is being established to inform the implementation process. </p>  <p>  In Q2 2021, given the immense pressures the health service experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and cyberattack, the HSE asked me to pause implementation of RHAs for a period of time. In recognition that structural and functional change is time consuming, I agreed to that request in order that HSE senior officials could devote their time to managing the vaccination rollout and cyberattack recovery. </p></reply>

It is expected to be open in November 2021. </p><p>The opening of the second of the three new campuses, the Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre, &ldquo;CHI at Tallaght&rdquo; will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.  It will provide further modern facilities to support primary and community paediatrics, will also support infection prevention and control, and improve patient pathways.</p><p>Together with the Urgent Care Centre at Connolly these new facilities will improve access to urgent care for a significant number of children.  </p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has the statutory responsibility and resources to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital and continues to engage with the main contractor and reviews the contractor&rsquo;s programme of works on a regular basis.</p><p>Like many other sectors of the economy, the construction sector has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and progress on the main building at St James&rsquo;s campus was delayed. In addition, the sector is challenged by Brexit and global supply chain issues, but the NPHDB and contractors are working hard to mitigate those risks.  </p><p>Despite delays, work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital building at St James&rsquo;s is progressing well and the building is taking shape. The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, closing in the concourse is now complete. The hospital will be essentially weathertight by end of the year. The fit out of certain internal areas is continuing, with discernible rooms and clinical areas taking shape. </p></reply>

The NIMC is made  up of the NIMC Steering Committee, which will be supported by a NIMC  Reference Group of Service Users and Families and NIMC Specialist  Groups. </p><p>The NIMC Steering Committee, independently chaired by Mr John Saunders, is  driving the implementation of Sharing the Vision, ensuring that  appropriate monitoring and oversight processes are in place. The  Steering Committee is meeting regularly and progressing the  establishment of specialist groups, and implementation monitoring  processes. The HSE has primary responsibility for the implementation of  the majority of the Sharing the Vision recommendations. To that end, the HSE Implementation Group (HIG), which reports to the NIMC Steering  Committee, was established in May 2021 and its work is progressing. Currently the NIMC Steering Committee and the HIG are  working together to develop an Implementation Plan (2022-2024) and associated enhanced implementation reporting processes.</p><p>The NIMC Steering Committee has additionally established Specialist  Groups in priority areas of development including CAMHS, Acute Inpatient Bed Capacity development  and also inWomen&rsquo;s Mental Health. Other specialist  groups may be established as appropriate, in a structured and strategic  manner in line with implementation priorities.  </p><p>Additionally, the Steering Committee is seeking to progress the establishment of the  Reference Group of Service Users and Families. To this end, an appropriate selection process is in progress to select a suitable agency to  host this group on behalf of the NIMC.</p><p>There is work ongoing across Government that aligns to the recommendations of Sharing the Vision. I am satisfied that the Committee is progressing  well in this initial stage of its work, by building on the following  initiatives already underway: </p><p>-Many significant recent developments in online mental health  service provision and positive mental health promotion have been  expedited in response to the ongoing pandemic. These initiatives  exemplify the holistic, whole-of-population approach to mental health  service development that Sharing the Vision  promotes and  seeks to advance, in parallel with the development of specialist  supports. </p><p>-Sharing the Vision recommends the continued phased implementation  and evaluation of existing national clinical programmes in mental  health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in Psychosis, and  Eating Disorders. The clinical programmes, which are in various stages  of design and implementation, are at the heart of service improvement. </p><p>-Sharing the Vision additionally recommends that, in keeping with  the evolving understanding of human rights to empower people and improve quality of care in mental healthcare facilities, legislation must be  updated and additional supports put in place. This is currently being  addressed in the review of the Mental Health Act, 2001, which was  completed, and a General Scheme approved by Government on 13 July 2021.  Following the Government decision to approve the heads of bill, a formal Bill will be drafted by the Office of the Attorney General, in  consultation with the Department of Health. </p><p>Additionally, on 14 October, 2021,  the Government and I announced another record funding plan,  with  further increases in the mental health budget for 2022. </p><p>A total of &euro;1.149 billion has been allocated to mental health in Budget  2022. This is an additional &euro;47 million for next year and comprises &euro;24  million for new developments, &euro;13 million for existing levels of service and &euro;10 million in once off funding for COVID-19. </p><p>The additional investment provided for in Budget 2022 will ensure the  continued development of mental health services, including out of hours  supports, child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and the  national clinical mental health programmes. An additional &euro;1.15 million  will be allocated to the Clinical Programme on Eating Disorders to  continue the roll out of specialist eating disorder teams in CHOs 1, 3, 5 and 6. New mental health services for older people will be developed,  in line with the model of care for specialist mental health services for older people and will be piloted next year. Two new CAMHS telehubs will be funded under Budget 2022 and funding will also be allocated to  enhance the capacity of CAMHS teams across the country. Crisis  resolution teams will continue to be developed with an allocated budget  of over &euro;1.4 million in 2022. </p><p>An additional &euro;10 million has been announced this week, as a once off  funding measure to provide further investment in mental health services  in 2021, with a particular emphasis on community and voluntary based  supports. </p></reply>

The eight toothed spruce bark beetle Ips typographus was first detected in the UK (in Kent) at the end of 2018.

Subsequently in July, three further outbreaks were confirmed, also in Kent and East Sussex. Further surveillance and eradication measures are on-going.</p><p>My officials have maintained close contact with their counterparts in the UK in relation to any developments which has included a visit to the original outbreak site in Kent.  </p><p>As the presence of the pest in England increases the level of risk of its introduction into Ireland, the Department has implemented additional risk-based surveys in Ireland to provide added assurance that the pest is not present or introduced.

It is clear that Ireland&rsquo;s current disease aid framework already provides many of the benefits of the Dutch Animal Health Fund, and in contrast to the situation for Dutch poultry farmers, does so without the requirement for a levy to be paid by Irish poultry producers into a disease fund.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s review of the PWG proposal is in the final stages of completion. A central consideration is whether a &lsquo;prevention is better than cure&rsquo; approach, a key component of the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy, is a more cost effective and a more responsible use of state funds as a support to industry. </p><p>My Officials have identified existing and additional measures which could be utilised to support the industry as much as possible to mitigate the risk of disease occurring in the first place.  One example of such a measure is my Department&rsquo;s commitment to co-finance an Animal Health Ireland Poultry Health Programme in a public/private partnership with the poultry sector. </p><p>The Department remains committed and fully engaged in providing a wide range of supportive measures in ensuring the industry can operate successfully in challenging circumstances.</p></reply>

Measures to be funded under the BAR must be implemented by 31 December 2023 and are subject to State Aid approval, eligibility under the BAR and to available BAR funds in the context of the impacts of Brexit across our economy.  </p>  <p>  I am having the Final Report urgently examined with a view to quickly implementing a comprehensive response to the impacts of the TCA on our fishing sector and coastal communities.  The measures recommended in the Task Force report will be examined with particular regard to available funds, eligibility of the measures for funding under the relevant EU Regulations, State Aid rules and the Public Spending Code. </p></reply>

The European Commission has deemed that Ireland&rsquo;s obligations arising from Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 were not being met by the Irish control plan as the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy could not be minimised.</p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.  As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational control matters such as this.</p>  <p>  I understand that the SFPA submitted a Control Plan to the EU Commission for review and approval on 22nd September 2021. </p>  <p>  During EU Commissioner Virginius Sinkevicius visit to Killybegs recently, representatives of the fishing industry set out the challenges facing the industry in the absence of a control plan that would allow weighing of fish in factories. I asked the Commissioner, during this visit, to give as much priority as possible to the Commission&rsquo;s examination of Ireland&rsquo;s draft control plan given the real challenges currently being faced by the industry.</p>  <p>  The queries regarding additional or interim arrangements are considered to be operational control matters for the SFPA. I have accordingly referred the Deputy's queries to SFPA for attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

A  licence may therefore include more than one thinning event and subsequent clear fell of the site, during the validity of the licence.</p></reply>
