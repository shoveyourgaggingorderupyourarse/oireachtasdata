New entrants will be allowed into the Scheme. This funding certainty has been widely welcomed by our Olympic and Paralympic community.</p>  <p>  Other important supports are also being provided, notably in relation to access to the world class facilities available at the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus in Blanchardstown. Due to the work and support of Sport Ireland and the NGBs our high performance athletes have already been back training since the 8th of June.  High performance sport is proceeding on a gradual and modified basis in accordance with detailed protocols.</p>  <p>  International travel, which is an essential part of high performance programmes, is also being facilitated and supported. Athletes may be required to travel overseas to compete in Olympic/Paralympic qualification events and major championships. The Return to Sport Expert Group, chaired by my Department, has developed detailed guidance to assist high performance sport in its approach to international travel. This important support will assist athletes that  need to travel, especially those who are still looking to qualify for the Olympics and Paralympics.</p>  <p>  Sport has been a leader throughout this pandemic.  Our Olympic and Paralympic athletes have acted as great role models, showing people how to adapt, keep physically active and demonstrating compliance with the guidelines in media appearances.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to offer my best wishes to our Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls.</p></reply>

The Music Stimulus Package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p>  <p>  Under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support pilot Scheme&rdquo; a further allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  Applications were accepted by my Department for this scheme and allocations will be made on the basis of the number of people being employed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have recently appointed the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce which is beìng chaired by Clare Duignan.  The membership of the taskforce includes representation from the Events Industry Alliance.   Taking as its starting point the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by my Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the Taskforce will prepare a report to me setting out recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The report will address culture, the arts, and the audiovisual and live entertainment industries.</p></reply>

The grants are aimed primarily at organisations or groups operating outside the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided current and capital funding to TechSpace (Camara Education) to support schools and youth organisations in purchasing Digital Media and STEM equipment. The TechSpace project is aimed at young people interested in developing their experience and skills in digital media and STEM. The network helps young people to create digital and technological material as they engage in activities such as digital film, web design, mobile app development and robotics, among others. Under the direction of trained instructors and mentors, young people can enhance their computer competency, while improving their self-confidence and social skills - all through the medium of Irish. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides an annual grant towards the running costs of An Cumann Scoildrama&iacute;ochta. An Cumann Scoildr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta encourages the use of the Irish language through drama. Young people are given the opportunity to use the language in a creative and artistic way, outside of a school setting. Teachers are also encouraged to produce and write new dramas themselves.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Aistritheoir&iacute; &Oacute;ga' (Young Translators) translation competition also funded by my Department is organised jointly by the European Commission and the Irish Government. It is open to students across Ireland who are at least 15 years of age who have the ability to translate from English into Irish, or from a choice of five other European languages into Irish.  The competition has three goals: to promote a high standard of Irish, to encourage multilingualism among secondary school students and to encourage their interest in careers with Irish.</p>  <p>  The Family Language Scheme (Sc&eacute;im Teanga T&iacute;), which is administered by Gl&oacute;r na nGael and Gaeloideachas Teo, aims to develop networks of Irish-speaking families among children attending Irish-medium education.  Under this programme, families whose children are in senior infants and who wish to raise their children through Irish are given support and encouragement to do so.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department and Foras na Gaeilge also provide funding to Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; and Raidi&oacute; na Life respectively. Both Irish language radio stations provide an excellent Irish Language radio service to young people, both withinin and outside of Gaeltacht areas.</p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding to an Irish language village family area as part of the St. Patrick's Festival, provides annual funding to An Taibhdhearc theatre, whose activities include an annual Christmas show for children, and provides capital funding for Irish language centres around the country which support the development of Irish speaking communities outside of the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I should also point the Deputy to the range of Irish language community and family supports provided by Foras na Gaeilge and its six lead organisations on an all-Island  basis. Details of these supports can be found on the organisation's webside at www.forasnagaeilge.ie.</p></reply>

Recognising the important role sport plays for physical and mental health, Minister Donnelly and I expressed our appreciation for the work that sport has done throughout the pandemic. The acting CMO highlighted the particular success of summer sports camps which had a very positive impact on the wellbeing of children and teenagers.</p>  <p>  The sporting representatives expressed their appreciation for the support of Government throughout the pandemic in terms of horizontal supports such as the TWSS and EWSS as well as targeted support approved by the previous Government last June. I understand that Sport Ireland are currently reviewing applications for the COVID-19 resilience funds and funding will be allocated and disbursed in late October. The sporting representatives advised that they foresee the financial challenges continuing into 2021 and asked that Government consider further support measures in the 2021 Budget. I have made representations to my colleague Minister McGrath in this respect and we will discuss the matter further in advance of Budget Day.</p>  <p>  Mr Treacy and the other sporting representatives also highlighted a number of matters of concern for the sport sector as the winter approaches, recognising that the autumn sees the commencement of the competitive calendar across many sports, particularly indoor sports. The insights from the sporting representatives informed the preparation of the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 published on the 15th of September last.</p>  <p>  I  also tabled for discussion the important issue of spectator attendance at sporting events. The sporting representatives outlined the work they have undertaken to date to facilitate a return of spectators while ensuring compliance with relevant public health guidance. We agreed that the Expert Group on Return to Sport would take this work forward in consultation with the relevant sporting bodies. Pursuant to this a working group has been established with representatives of my Department, Sport Ireland and the relevant sporting bodies to develop a proposal for spectator attendance at large national and international sporting events, for consideration by the Expert Group and by the public health authorities. This proposal will incorporate guidelines to be applied by all sporting bodies at large sports stadia. This work is already underway and it is expected that this proposal will be presented for consideration next month.</p></reply>

Almost all tourism businesses were initially required to close in order to comply with the necessary public health measures introduced. Many have since reopened but, unfortunately, the majority of businesses are operating with significantly reduced levels of turnover compared to 2019 as a result of ongoing public health measures and the almost complete absence of overseas tourists coming into the country. This has meant that many jobs in the sector have been lost or are vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Along with my colleagues in Government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this current crisis. The July Stimulus Package introduced significant measures to help support businesses to recover following the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the &ldquo;Stay and Spend&rdquo; initiative, the &euro;26m adaptation grant, the &euro;10m grant for coach tourism and the revised Restart grant which now includes B&amp;B&rsquo;s.  Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal supports such as the new Employment Wage Support Scheme, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  As part of its response to Covid-19, and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year.  I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home.</p>  <p>  All of these measures have helped the sector. I appreciate, however, that severe challenges remain and we need to continue to examine ways to ensure that businesses survive and recover. The Tourism Recovery Taskforce appointed in May has just submitted its report to me. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector to survive the crisis and eventually recover. Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the Budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

The Music Stimulus Package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p><p>Under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support pilot Scheme&rdquo; a further allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  Applications were accepted by my Department for this scheme and allocations will be made on the basis of the number of people being employed.</p><p>In the meantime, I have appointed an Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce which represents the putting in place of a commitment in the Programme for Government to ensure that survival of recovery of this very important sector.  The Taskforce will be chaired by Clare Duignan and membership is as follows:</p><p>- Arts Council</p><p>- Business to Arts</p><p>- Council of the National Cultural Institutions</p><p>- County and City Management Association (CCMA)</p><p>- Department of Health</p><p>- Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht</p><p>- Department of Social Protection</p><p>- Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta</p><p>- Events Industry Alliance</p><p>- Irish Congress of Trade Unions</p><p>- National Campaign for the Arts</p><p>- Irish Music Rights Organisation</p><p>- Irish Theatre Institute</p><p>- Screen Ireland</p><p>- Screen Producers Ireland</p><p>- Denise Chaila</p><p>- Martin Hayes</p><p>The Taskforce will prepare a report for the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The sector includes culture, the arts, the audiovisual industry and the live entertainment industry.  Taking as its starting point, the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by the Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the Taskforce will:-</p><p>- adopt a solution-focused approach;</p><p>- seek sector-specific expert input and consult with stakeholders;</p><p>- invite additional individuals or expertise to attend meetings on an ad hoc basis, as it deems necessary;</p><p>- focus on providing intelligence and recommendations for an expected on-going and varying impact of COVID-19 restrictions;</p><p>- identify immediate and medium term goals for recovery and sustainability in the sector;</p><p>- identify possible policy initiatives or impediments to a robust sustainable recovery in the sector;</p><p>- recommend whole of Government policy initiatives and actions to support the sector;</p><p>- report to the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht by the 31 October 2020 in order to provide the Government with an action-plan for the sector.</p><p>The taskforce has already met twice.  Its proceedings will be conducted in a transparent manner and all correspondence will be published in due course.</p></reply>

On 13th January additional provisional allocations of &euro;5m for a further 7 projects under Stream 1 (design) of the LSSIF were announced. The Stream 1 allocations included an allocation of &euro;918,750 to Dublin City Council towards the overall design cost (estimated at &euro;2,450,000) for the redevelopment of Dalymount Park.</p>  <p>  The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the projects being suggested for funding undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code and EU State Aid rules. This has now been completed for the Dalymount project.</p>  <p>  As the LSSIF is a new scheme with the first grants only announced this year, it has been necessary to agree an appropriate funding agreement which will protect the state investment, adhere to Public Spending Code requirements and provide clarity in relation to the respective responsibilities to ensure that projects are completed. This has involved extensive engagement with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. I understand that work in this regard is nearing completion  and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to forward a funding agreement for signature to Dublin City Council in the near future.</p></reply>

All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April with 6 new allocations approved. </p>  <p>  The priority to date this year has been to advance all projects previously allocated funding to ensure the facilities are available for use and that the relevant grants are drawn down. In this regard, over &euro;20m has been paid out to over 800 different sports clubs and groups so far this year.</p>  <p>  With regard to future rounds of the programme, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review. Work on these terms and conditions is now being finalised and a decision on a new round of the programme will be made after that is completed.</p></reply>

To support an application to my Department, the Regulations require submission of an undertaking that in producing the film, the producer company and the qualifying company (&ldquo;the companies&rdquo;) shall provide quality employment, and training and skills development opportunities.  In providing those opportunities the companies undertake that in the event that the application for certification of the film is successful, the companies shall as a condition of certification:</p>  <p>  - comply in all material aspects with all applicable laws including but not limited to all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law that apply at the place where the Services are provided, that have been established by EU law, national law, and collective agreements</p>  <p>  - be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall be solely responsible in law for the employment, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel retained for the purposes of the production of the film</p>  <p>  - have in place written policies and procedures in relation to grievances, discipline and dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunities)</p>  <p>  - provide details of any Work Place Commission decisions in relation to the companies or other companies in the film group, and where those decisions are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed.</p>  <p>  Employees in Ireland benefit from a range of statutory employment protections.  Responsibility for employment rights policy rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which is also the Department under whose aegis the Workplace Relations Commission lies.  Determination of employment status in terms of PRSI are dealt with by the Scope Section of Social Protection which has responsibility for making decisions on the insurability of employment. Any person, business or their representatives may apply to have an employment investigated to make sure that the correct PRSI Class is applied.</p></reply>

Those taskforces include:</p>  <p>  - The Tourism Industry Taskforce;</p>  <p>  - The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce;</p>  <p>  - The Night-time Economy Taskforce, and;</p>  <p>  - An Expert Group on Return to Sport.</p>  <p>  I will consider the views and recommendations of these taskforces in the context of Budget 2021 and in mapping out how to best help those sectors remain viable going forward. With the upcoming Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will continue to review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures required as a consequence of COVID-19.</p></reply>

These supports aim to develop visitor experiences and associated tourism infrastructure and products; enhance industry capability and run targeted marketing campaigns and other promotional activity - all underpinned by coordinated leadership structures, appropriate networking and community activation.  I understand the next phase of brand development will be further informed by Tourism Master Plans for the River Shannon and Beara Breifne Way &ndash; the two centrepieces of the brand offering.</p><p>As the development of <i>Ireland's Hidden Heartlands</i>on the ground is led by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I have asked the agency to provide the Deputies with further detail on its plans for further brand development and expansion and promotion of the related tourism offering.

In responding to the crisis the Government has committed significant additional funding in 2020.  Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2020, excluding provisions for expenditure on administration in my Department, together with the COVID-19 and Jobs Stimulus funding, will increase from &euro;183 million to almost &euro;239 million, which is an increase of &euro;56 million, or more than 30%. </p>  <p>  The Arts Council of Ireland is the body through which primary support for the arts is delivered.  The Arts Council funding has increased in recent years and has been increased in 2020 from &euro;80m to &euro;105 million to assist it in supporting artists through the crisis.</p>  <p>  The recently appointed Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce is preparing a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Under the terms of the scheme, the Department provides a subsidy, currently worth &euro;10 per day (equivalent to &euro;220 per student for a three week course) which benefits over 26,000 students a year while staying in any of the c.700 Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme. This represents a State investment of over &euro;4m annually in the Irish summer colleges sector, which forms a critical part of the Gaeltacht economy and is estimated in overall terms to be worth &euro;50m annually.</p>  <p>  Following the cancellation, on 20th April 2020, of Irish summer college courses by my Department in the interests of protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department approved a once-off emergency measure worth &euro;4.7m to support the stabilisation of the Gaeltacht Irish summer college sector. </p>  <p>  Under the stabilisation package, up to &euro;3.1m is being directed at enabling college authorities to refund fees/deposits to parents in full in respect of 2020 courses, while a further &euro;1.6m is being allocated towards supporting the c. 700 certified Gaeltacht householders who normally provide accommodation to attending students.  The majority of this funding has now been paid out by my Department.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the stabilisation fund was provided as a specific once-off measure with the overall objective of ensuring the ongoing viability of the sector. The approval of this stability initiative took account of the need to address without delay, issues around cash-flow within the summer college sector, which significantly hampered colleges&rsquo; ability to adequately refund fees/deposits to parents.</p>  <p>  Based, not least, on the broadly positive feedback regarding the measure from relevant stakeholders within the Irish summer colleges sector,  I am satisfied that the measure was both necessary and effective.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2021, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible at this juncture to predict whether summer colleges will be in a position to operate due to the ongoing pandemic. Having said that, the Deputy may be assured that my Department will continue to carefully monitor the situation and will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders, including CONCOS, the summer colleges' umbrella organisation, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Like everyone else involved in the summer colleges sector, I look forward to working ultimately towards the safe return of Irish summer colleges in the future, and the ongoing contribution of our Gaeltacht households and colleges to the development of the Irish language and to sustaining Gaeltacht communities.</p></reply>

This outlined a proposed revision of the existing scheme, seeking to align the scheme with the Government&rsquo;s language planning approach - in line with the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language. </p>  <p>  The paper, which was based on consultation with relevant stakeholders, also recommended that the funding to groups be increased to cover salary and associated costs on a five-day basis.  </p>  <p>  It is now proposed that a new scheme be developed focusing on the principles of language planning, and that a primary objective of this revised scheme should be to support government policies - those set out in the Gaeltacht Act 2012, in respect of Irish language networks and Gaeltacht service towns, and in the north as outlined in the Draft Strategy to Enhance and Protect the Development of the Irish Language.</p>  <p>  The new scheme is currently being finalised by Foras na Gaeilge in conjunction with my Department and the Department for Communities in the North.  Subject to the completion of this process, it will be advertised publicly before the end of 2020 and will come into operation in July 2021.</p>  <p>  The group referenced by the Deputy has received funding through the present scheme for the past nine years and has done tremendous work in promoting and developing the Irish Language in its area.  It will, of course, be eligible to apply for the new scheme when advertised.</p></reply>

The incentive applies to feature films, television dramas, animations and creative documentaries. All claims in respect of section 481 are now on a self-assessment basis and subject to Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions. Under the self-assessment basis, the administration of the film corporation tax credit has been separated into two steps: The first step involves the certification of a film as a qualifying film by my Department while the second step involves the producer company making a claim for credit relief through Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service. </p>  <p>  To support an application to my Department, the Regulations require submission of an undertaking that in producing the film, the producer company and the qualifying company (&ldquo;the companies&rdquo;) shall provide quality employment, and training and skills development opportunities. This is known as the &lsquo;TAB M Undertaking&rsquo; and in the event that the application for certification of the film is successful, the TAB M Undertaking commits companies to: comply in all material aspects with all applicable laws, including employment law; be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer; have written policies and procedures in relation to grievances, discipline and dignity at work; and provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) decisions in relation to the companies or other companies in the film group, and where those decisions are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. It is a standard condition of section 481 Certificates that both the producer company and qualifying company shall continue to comply with the conditions of the TAB M undertaking while producing the certified film and to have available, as part of the compliance report required under Regulation 10 of the Film Regulations 2019, any Work Place Commission decisions in relation to any company in the film group. </p>  <p>  The WRC is a statutorily independent office of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is tasked, inter alia, with the adjudication of employment rights and complaints of penalisation pursuant to the Protected Disclosures Act.  The decisions of the WRC and its appellant body, the Labour Court are publically available.  The WRC does not comment on individual cases and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on cases that are currently before the WRC.</p></reply>

In this context, funding for the Arts Council has been further increased and last month I launched a number of new music and performance support schemes to aid employment in the creative industries.  An allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.</p>  <p>  A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.  These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p>  <p>  With the upcoming Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures required as a consequence of COVID-19.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan has provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount (&euro;300,000) available under the Sports Capital Programme (SCP).</p>  <p>  Provisional Grants totalling &euro;82.5m were announced in January of this year. The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code. This work is continuing and the priority in the short term is on advancing the projects allocated funding in January. While it is not proposed to open the fund for new applications at present, it is planned to review progress on existing grants in 2021 when the question of whether or not it would be appropriate to seek new applications will be considered.</p></reply>

Government policy supports the film and television sector in a number of ways to create an attractive environment for film production: through funding for Screen Ireland, international film co-production treaties, an annual international programme of Irish film festivals, and the engagement of high-profile talent to project a positive image of Ireland and reflect Ireland as a creative place. </p>  <p>  The section 481 tax credit system is also a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audiovisual industry in Ireland. Its importance is highlighted in the Government&rsquo;s Audiovisual Action Plan under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme which is designed to deliver on ambitions to make Ireland a leader in the audiovisual sector and contains a number of recommendations in respect of our tax regime. Significant work has taken place in this area in the past year.  In July 2019, the EU Commission gave State Aid approval in respect of two aspects of Irelands tax credit: the extension of the Section 481 credit until 2024 which provides certainty for film production companies on the future availability of the credit, ensuring the continued growth of our film industry; and the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift which offers an additional tapered tax credit over a period of 4 years and supports the development of a vibrant creative audio-visual sector across the country. The Department of Finance is represented on the Audiovisual Action Plan Steering Group, which will continue to keep section 481 under review over the lifetime of the Audiovisual Action Plan.</p></reply>

I would highlight in this regard the Sport Ireland Women in Sport programme established in 2005, which has provided funding support of over &euro;20 million to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation by women and girls. My predecessors Shane Ross and Brendan Griffin, T.D. were enthusiastic supporters of the Federation of Irish Sport's 20 x 20 campaign and my colleague Minister Chambers has already been in discussions with the Federation on how Government can do more to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  In respect to the sporting body referred to by the Deputy, at the outset I must recognise that as a National Governing Body of sport the Government respects the indepenence and autonomy of this association in organising its competitions, selecting international teams and other matters. Payments to international players is a matter for the association itself, and neither I nor my Department have any role in determining the level of payments for the different international teams selected by this or any other National Governing Body of sport.</p>  <p>  With that being said, it is important to recognise that when the members of the women's international team referred to by the Deputy highlighted challenges in their remunerations and conditions, my predecessor Minister Ross raised the issue with the association concerned on a number of occasions. In 2018 the Minister provided additional funding to support the women's international team referred to by the Deputy. In 2019, in spite of a number of challenges, my Department and Sport Ireland made arrangements to ensure that funding allocated for the women's international team was disbursed to them and used to support their preparations for international fixtures.</p>  <p>  I want to thank the Deputy for highlighting this important issue and I can assure him that I will indeed discuss the question of equality for the men's and women's senior international teams with the sporting association concerned at the earliest opportunity. I would like to assure the Deputy that the importance of women's sport is something I will be highlighting in all my contacts with national and international sporting bodies.</p></reply>

For some sectors, especially those that require personal contact with customers, such as hospitality, it has been more difficult to adapt to social distancing requirements.  We also know our young people have been disproportionally impacted by COVID-19 and we must ensure they are not left behind.</p>  <p>  To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions economy wide totalling almost &euro;20 billion. While these supports are wide ranging, they will by their nature be of most assistance to the most heavily impacted firms and sectors.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed and includes:</p>  <p>  - A new Employment Wage Support Scheme that will succeed the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and run until April 2021;</p>  <p>  - Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 available to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;Bs, and independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs;</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;10 million Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector;</p>  <p>  - The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19. This is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - The recently reopened Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan scheme; and</p>  <p>  - Several other initiatives to provide vital liquidity to all firms who are experiencing impacts have been introduced including rates waivers, temporary VAT reductions, delayed payment of PAYE and VAT debts, in part or in full, for a set period with no interest or penalties, and the early carry back of trading losses providing immediate cash-flow support to previously profitable companies.</p>  <p>  Recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on pubs, bars and nightclubs, and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening, an additional &euro;16 million support package for this sector was announced at the end of August. This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen, a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020 and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p>  <p>  While we have, and will continue to, help our business, we are also assisting those who may have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19 or whose jobs continue to be in a precarious position, getting staff back to work and creating new opportunities for those unable to return to their old jobs. Indeed, a &euro;200 million investment in education and training was announced in the July Stimulus. To support people without jobs, especially young people the July Stimulus included:</p>  <p>  - A clear timeline for the continuation of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will help to provide assurances to those who suffered job losses;</p>  <p>  - A new Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme to assist employers to continue to recruit apprentices during the immediate Covid-19 period;</p>  <p>  - Funding for some 60,000 places in further and higher education, skills training, and work placement and experience schemes; and</p>  <p>  - The JobsPlus Scheme that will provide subsidies to encourage employers to hire someone under the age of 30 who is on the Live Register or the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p>  <p>  Having come through the initial economic shock with unprecedented levels of State intervention stabilising the economy, the focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan, which I expect to be launched in November.</p></reply>

The effect of this latest important step is that all Irish towns with populations in excess of 10,000 are now LSZs within which the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal is prohibited. This will have a positive impact in terms of reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in the areas selected, with consequent public health benefits for residents of these new zones.</p>  <p>  We have given a commitment in the Programme for Government to work towards a full nationwide extension of the regulations over the lifetime of the Government.  The Department is taking the first step in this process by developing a public consultation document which recognises the need for a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of solid fuel  generally, including other smoky fuels in addition to bituminous coal, with a view to ensuring a transition to lower polluting fuels for residential heating. Responses received to the consultation will help to inform the decisions to be made regarding the implementation and enforcement of a nationwide extension.

As part of the Green Deal Package, the European Commission is proposing to revise the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD). Currently under the ETD, aviation fuel, except for that which is used in private-pleasure flying, is exempt from excise duty although Member States can choose to tax aviation fuel for domestic flights and, by means of bilateral agreements, also fuel used in intra-EU flight. The Commission has suggested that this exemption for aviation fuel should be closely examined and the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union has published an Inception Impact Assessment on revising the ETD. The Commission has opened a public consultation process and is open until 14 October 2020. </p><p>Ireland's Action Plan for the reduction of aviation emissions is available on my Department's website:</p><p>As regards monitoring of private aircraft operating into Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is responsible from an aviation safety perspective and often audits private aircraft operating into Ireland to ensure that they are compliant with the regulatory requirements for airworthiness, operations and flight crew licensing. All flights, regardless of departure or destination, are required to file a flight plan when they intend to enter controlled airspace and all flights arriving into Ireland must follow the requirements as outlined in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP). There are also a number of documentary, customs and immigration requirements for aircraft arriving from abroad outlined in the AIP. The oversight of those requirements would come under the aegis of the respective agency, i.e. Department of Justice for immigration requirements, Revenue Commissioners for customs requirements.</p></reply>

Inevitably, there is now a backlog of theory tests.</p>  <p>  The Road  Safety Authority is currently engaging with the service provider to maximise capacity within existing constraints.  They will be opening on additional days (at some centres) and extended hours will also be provided at differnet centres to allow additional capacity for appointments. Capacity is now back to levels comparable with last year but clearing the backlog will take time.</p>  <p>  Those whose appointments were cancelled by the RSA due to the Covid-19 situation will have first priority.

The funding is available for operators of public transport routes where the financial intervention is supported by a clear public interest justification, and the funding is targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support and it is doing this by putting in place contract with the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  In addition to this valuable new support scheme for licensed bus services, there is also a wider programme of Government supports for businesses impacted by the Covid situation.  These supports iinclude new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example - all of which will help to improve cash flow amongst SMEs.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of how badly impacted the coach tourism sector has been by the public health crisis, due to the lack of international tourists and a fall in demand for local coach services. I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been asked to develop a Business Continuity Scheme to help these businesses through this very difficult period. F&aacute;ilte Ireland are engaging with the sector to develop this scheme which has been allocated &euro;10m in funding. The scheme is under the remit of my colleague, Catherine Martin, Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that issues relating to the law on Value Added Tax are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on or investigate individual cases such as that of her constituent.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  The Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers and businesses and work will advance on this matter through the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing the affordability and accessibility of public liability insurance which is key for tourism companies, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Executive Board of the Judicial Council shortly. While the adoption of those Guidelines will be a matter for the Judicial Council, it is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that prioritising delivery on the commitments to insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Amongst the eligibility tests for the relief set out in that section is an age limit, whereby the transferee (the person coming into possession of the land) must be under 35 years of age on the date of execution of the deed of transfer of the land.</p>  <p>  As well as satisfying the age requirement, to qualify for this relief the farmer must have attained a minimum agricultural education standard which is set out on a list of qualifications in Schedule 2B of the SDCA 1999. The young trained farmer, or each of them if there is more than one must retain ownership of the land for a period of 5 years from the date of execution of the instrument and during that time must devote not less than 50 per cent of his or her normal working time to farming the land. The exemption granted will be clawed back if the land is disposed of within a five-year period and is not replaced within one year of disposal. The transfer can be by gift or sale, but transfers by lease do not qualify for the stamp duty exemption. The young trained farmer must also submit a business plan to Teagasc before the execution of the deed transferring the land.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the young trained farmer stamp duty relief is just one of a series of tax measures, including consanguinity stamp duty relief, designed to encourage the intergenerational transfer of farms. The primary policy objectives of the Government in agri-taxation are to support and encourage the increased mobility of farm land to a new generation of farmers with relevant qualifications. The 35 year old age limit is long established for young trained farmer stamp duty relief and has applied since 1994.</p>  <p>  The paper on Stamp Duty prepared by my Department for the Tax Strategy Group which took place on 10 September, notes possible inconsistencies in terms of the age at which one ceases to qualify as a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; and my Department will further examine this issue with a view to reporting on the outcome to me in advance of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The arrangements apply to VAT liabilities in respect of January/February 2020 to July/August 2020 inclusive and PAYE (Employer) liabilities in respect of February to August 2020 inclusive.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides that outstanding VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities incurred during the period of restricted trading (known as Period 1) can be deferred for a period of 12 months after resumption of trading (known as Period 2). Rather than the normal interest rate of c. 10% per annum on such liabilities, interest on &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; debts is applied at 0% to the end of the &lsquo;Period 2&rsquo; 12-month period and 3% thereafter until the liabilities are paid (known as Period 3).</p>  <p>  Access to the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements are dependent on all outstanding tax returns being filed and current taxes being paid on a timely basis once trading is resumed. The 0% interest rate available in Period 2 can be extended to a date no later than 31 December 2022 by Ministerial Order. Businesses that avail of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; scheme also qualify for a Tax Clearance Certificate if they otherwise meet the normal qualifying conditions. This allows them to avail of other essential Covid-19 related supports such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Stay and Spend Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that there are almost 70,000 taxpayers and businesses currently availing of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements to the value of &euro;1.8 billion (&euro;978m VAT and &euro;825m Employers PAYE). As I have previously stated, it is not possible to provide an estimated cost for this measure because it is not clear when the warehoused debt will be paid.  The zero interest period will cover most of 2021 for most taxpayers but taxpayer behaviour after that cannot be predicted. </p>  <p>  As a further support measure for businesses, I also introduced a reduced annual interest rate of 3% for certain tax debts as part of the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus Package. This rate represents a significant reduction from the standard 8% and 10% rates that normally apply to such liabilities and is applicable across all tax-heads and outstanding debts that cannot be &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo;, for example older liabilities and tax debts not associated with Covid-19. The interest rate reduction is a key incentive to businesses to bring their tax affairs into order, be tax cleared, and thereby become eligible for the other Covid-19 related supports that are available, including the EWSS and the Stay and Spend Scheme.   </p>  <p>  To avail of the reduced 3% rate, businesses are required to agree a payment arrangement with Revenue by 31 October 2020 (extended from 30 September 2020). Revenue has advised me that over &euro;46m of non-Covid-19 related tax debt is now covered by phased payments incorporating the reduced 3% rate.</p></reply>

The aim of this exercise is to determine the amount of TWSS, if any that an employer may owe back to Revenue. </p>  <p>  I understand that an employer may be required to repay amounts of TWSS where the employer has not paid the subsidy amount to the specified employee or where the employer was not entitled to receive the subsidy in the first place as it did not meet the qualifying criteria. In addition, where an employee does not meet the eligible employee requirement and received subsidy amounts, the employer will also be required to refund these amounts to Revenue.</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) replaced the TWSS from 1 September. To qualify for EWSS, an employer must have tax clearance. An employer will also be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Revenue that its business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or in customer orders in the period between 1 July and 31 December 2020 and that Covid-19 is the cause of this disruption. An employer will have a monthly ongoing obligation to review its eligibility for the scheme. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the EWSS scheme is operated as intended by employers, Revenue will undertake an assurance check programme at a later date. </p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the information outlined above relates to the general operation of TWSS and EWSS and does not relate to any one employer or a small group of employers within any one industry.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that by 30 September, 37,165 employers had successfully registered for the scheme.  Furthermore, payments of EWSS claims, in respect of employees and proprietary directors, for the month of September, will be made in the middle of this month.</p><p>Executive directors are directors of a company who are involved in the day to day management of the company.  Executive directors are generally treated the same as ordinary employees provided, they are not also a proprietary director.  Therefore, subject to the company meeting the eligibility conditions, the employer can claim a subsidy in respect of executive directors similar to employees.</p><p>Proprietary directors are directors who can control, either directly or indirectly, more than 15% of the share capital of a company.  Under the EWSS legislation as enacted, proprietary directors are not qualifying employees for the purposes of the scheme.  However, as I announced at the end of July this position has been revisited and the EWSS can be claimed by an eligible employer in respect of proprietary directors from 1 September 2020, where they meet the objective of the scheme of retaining ordinary employees on the payroll.</p><p>Following the review of the matter undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, it has been agreed that the only additional qualifying criteria that will apply in the case of proprietary directors as qualifying employees is that the proprietary director has to have been paid wages which were reported to Revenue on the payroll of the eligible employer at any stage between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020.  Further, it has also been agreed that where a person is a proprietary director of two or more eligible companies, a claim for EWSS can only be submitted in respect of a single company only.  </p><p>The amending legislation necessary to give a statutory footing to the above will be included in the Finance Bill later this year.</p><p>In the meantime, the above will be implemented by Revenue as confirmed in both a press release that was issued on 31 August (see ) and the updated Guidance (see ).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-01a.278.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100100076#WRE05000"><p>As set out in my response Parliamentary Questions Nos. 107 and 128, the overall Budgetary Strategy for 2021 will focus on prioritising crisis management measures to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit while preserving and maintaining existing levels of service within core expenditure programmes. </p>  <p>  Ensuring the provision of the necessary funding to support our citizens and key public services over the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the key priority in Budget 2021. In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021. Consequently, there is a range of potential expenditure requirements that need to be worked through in detail.  At this stage, on a no policy change basis, and assuming an improved position in relation to employment next year based on the latest macroeconomic projections, it is estimated that there could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to Covid-19 expenditure reflecting:</p>  <p>  - the carryover costs of the July stimulus programme;</p>  <p>  - significant expenditure on automatic stabilisers including job-seekers payments and related supports;</p>  <p>  - ongoing costs in health to deal with Covid-19;</p>  <p>  - the carryover costs relating to both the Roadmap for Reopening Schools, and to the package of supports  to enable further and higher education students to return to college; and</p>  <p>  - the ongoing requirement to fund public transport while employees continue to be encouraged to work from home.</p>  <p>  Further details will be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report. It should be noted that these pressures will be dealt with separately from core expenditure increases and given their scale, will form a significant part of the overall budgetary package. </p>  <p>  In relation to core expenditure programmes, &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure was allocated to Departments in the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2020 published in December 2019. At this stage it is planned that the Budget Estimates for 2021 will include an increase of approximately &euro;3 billion in this core expenditure, comprising:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 billion in current expenditure</p>  <p>  - &euro;1 billion in capital expenditure;</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;2 billion in current expenditure it is estimated that there are pre-commitments of &euro;1.1 billion to be funded in relation to demographics, and to meet the carryover costs of prior year measures and of public service pay deals. Work is also ongoing in finalising these costs, and on the emerging core expenditure position for this year for this year. Outside of these expenditure pressures, it is estimated that there is an amount of &euro;0.9 billion available to meet other day to day pressures on existing services across all areas of Government. </p>  <p>  In relation to Capital expenditure, we will also ensure that the increase in capital investment set out in the National Development Plan is implemented in order to support the recovery in the economy. This would see core gross voted capital expenditure of almost &euro;9.2 billion next year, an increase of almost &euro;1 billion on the gross voted expenditure amount set out for this year in REV 2020. </p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2021 will also be prepared on the assumption that the trading relationship between the UK and EU will be on WTO terms in 2021. This will necessitate additional supports for the most affected sectors of the Irish economy next year. The costs associated with these supports will form an essential part of budgetary discussions and details of these costs will be set out in the 2021 Expenditure Report on Budget day.</p></reply>

The value attributable to the pension scheme member is based on a number of factors, including age at retirement, life expectancy, pay grade and pensionable service.  </p><p>However, the National Shared Service Office does consider whether a member's pension obligations, valued in line with Revenue capitalisation factors, exceed the Standard Fund Threshold at retirement.</p><p>It is worth noting that on 19 December 2017, this Department published a report of the actuarial review of the State's accrued liability in respect of Public Service Occupational Pensions that was carried out by my Department.  </p><p>In summary, the actuarial review found that the value of the State&rsquo;s accrued liability in respect of retirement benefits for current and former public service employees is estimated to be &euro;114.5bn as at 31 December 2015. A revised estimate based on 31 December 2018 will be published by year end 2020.</p><p>While this is a large figure, it is important to bear in mind that the accrued liability will fall to be paid over the next 70 years or so &ndash; not in any single year. It is also important to stress that we have taken a number of significant steps to improve the long-term sustainability of public service pensions in recent times.  </p><p>For example, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme introduced from 2013 will, in time, reduce liabilities by around 35% from what would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>Additionally, under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017,  the introduction of an Additional Superannuation Contribution by public servants. This increased employee pension contributions from over &euro;700m per annum to &euro;1.25bn in 2019, thus providing substantial additional ongoing funding support towards the cost of public service pensions from those that benefit from such pensions.  </p><p>Furthermore, the compulsory retirement age has increased from 65 to 70 for public servants recruited before 1 April 2004. This will also assist in reducing the time period over which pension payments will be paid to those public service employees who opt to remain in work longer.</p><p>The full report is published on my Department's website at the following link.</p></reply>

It was a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there were no alternative feasible measures. The OPW liaised with homeowners and local authorities to identify those homes that flooded during this flood event. Through the scheme, engineering solutions have been identified to protect the majority of homes that flooded in the floods of Winter 2015/2016. </p>  <p>  To date, 40 applications have been received by homeowners for the  Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme with 25 approved to date at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;7m.  </p>  <p>  The overall number of homes currently under consideration for the scheme is relatively low which presents a risk that individual homeowners could be identified by providing data at local authority level.

The three main policy aims of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 are to increase participation by children and adults from all sectors of society, to have more Irish athletes and teams systematically and fairly achieving world-class results at the highest level of international competition, and to improve capacity to have Irish sporting bodies with strong leadership, ethics and governance at all levels, professionals and volunteers suitably trained and developed, and modernised working methods and systems.</p>  <p>  The ambition is to increase investment in sport over the 10-year lifetime of the National Sports Policy, to reach an annual level that exceeds &euro;220 million by 2027. This figure is approximately double the funding allocated to sport in 2018. Additional funding was allocated for sport in the 2019 and 2020 budgets. This demonstrates the commitment that exists to achieving this ambition. </p>  <p>  This increased investment in sport is showing a real return, with improved performances by our high performance athletes and a marked increase in participation across the population, including in hard-to-reach communities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, just last week a further &euro;7.3 million in funding support has been allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund for sports programmes throughout the country, with the objective of increasing participation in sport and physical activity in disadvantaged communities and by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Government's investment in sport will continue to deliver a real impact and that in the coming years, there will be further increases in funding for sport with a view to achieving the ambition set out in the National Sports Policy.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, any additional funding for sport in 2021 is subject to the Estimates 2021 process, which is underway.  I will be aiming to achieve the best outcome for sport as part of that process.</p></reply>

The Irish Sports Monitor Report 2019, recently published by Sport Ireland, found once again that swimming is among the most popular forms of sport in Ireland. Swimming is particularly popular among women and older people who tend to be less active. Sport Ireland research has found that regrettably the numbers of people swimming has declined substantially in 2020 due to the closure of swimming pools. I am pleased that under the Resilience and Recovery Plan, swimming pools are currently permitted to open in all parts of the country. I have however received representations from many swimming pool operators who are experiencing severe financial strain at present.</p>  <p>  As part of the July Jobs Stimulus, I announced a special fund of &euro;2.5 million to support the reopening of publicly accessible swimming pools, in recognition of the particular challenges pool operators face in reopening to the public. This funding will be administered by Sport Ireland, which is the statutory body for the development of sport. Sport Ireland is currently finalising the grant scheme.  Full details of the scheme and the application process will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the revised Restart Grant Scheme which was also announced as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, rateable sports, leisure and fitness facilities will be eligible for a grant payment of &euro;4,000.  Information on the grant is available on the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation website www.dbei.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  In recent contacts with the sport sector, it has been made clear that the financial and operational challenges associated with COVID-19 will continue into 2021. Any additional funding for sport in 2021 is subject to the Estimates 2021 process, which is currently underway.</p></reply>

This organisation has been an exemplar for good governance in the sport sector and the lessons learned have been of benefit to many other sporting bodies. The real beneficiaries of this process are of course our high performance athletes and teams who now have a far greater role in decision-making to ensure their interests are paramount in all matters.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that Sport Ireland's working relationship with the organisation is excellent and the collaboration with the organisation and other relevant sporting bodies is working very well. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games has been a significant setback for the dedicated athletes and their coaches, who have also had to deal with the wider disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However I am heartened to see many of our athletes performing on the world stage in recent weeks, including Sam Bennett in cycling and Ciara Mageean and Nadia Power in athletics. I am confident that the resilient high performance programme led by Sport Ireland will ensure the athletes have every support as they look to achieve their dream of standing on the podium in Tokyo.</p></reply>

The regulatory framework for online safety will be overseen by the Online Safety Commissioner. The Commissioner will have the power to designate online services for regulation and to create and enforce binding online safety codes, which will set standards that online services will be required to follow. These will seek to minimise the availability of harmful online content through oversight of the systems that online services used to deliver and moderate content.

Along with my colleagues in Government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this current crisis. The July Stimulus Package introduced significant measures to help support businesses to recover following the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the &ldquo;Stay and Spend&rdquo; initiative, the &euro;26m adaptation grant, the &euro;10m grant for coach tourism and the revised Restart grant which now includes B&amp;B&rsquo;s.  Tourism enterprises also benefit from wider horizontal supports such as the new Employment Wage Support Scheme, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  As part of its response to COVID-19, and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year.  I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home. </p>  <p>  All of these measures have been of great benefit to the sector. I appreciate, however, that we need to continue to examine ways to ensure that businesses survive and recover. The Tourism Recovery Taskforce appointed in May submitted its report to me this week. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector to survive the crisis and eventually recover. Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the Budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

The impact of the drop in value of sterling since the UK referendum on EU membership in 2016 has been that from a tourism perspective, Ireland has become a more expensive destination for UK visitors.  The number of British visitors to Ireland in 2019 was 3.5% less<b></b>than in 2016 and the associated revenue generated by British visitors was 7.9% less in 2019 than in 2016.</p><p>A No-Deal Brexit, combined with impacts of Covid-19, will have very significant negative impacts for Irish tourism. It will mean fewer tourists, lower revenues, less employment and a lost in Exchequer earnings from the sector. These losses will impact Ireland as a whole but will be felt hardest in regional areas where there are few alternatives to replace the economic benefits generated by tourism.</p><p>In 2019, the Government allocated almost &euro;8 million in additional funding to the tourism agencies specifically to respond to the impact of Brexit. Furthermore, additional Government supplementary funding of &euro;7 million was provided to the agencies at the end of 2019, primarily to support accelerated tourism marketing initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of Brexit.</p><p>Budget 2020 saw an allocation of almost &euro;186 million for tourism, up 10% (over &euro;17m) on the 2019 allocation. This has helped to ensure that the agencies remain equipped to deal with the challenges caused by Brexit as the situation evolves. Budget 2020 also included a &euro;40m contingency fund for tourism, which would be available in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>GB is a vital market for Ireland&rsquo;s tourism sector. It provides the best seasonal and regional dispersion of visitors across the country. GB is Ireland&rsquo;s single largest source market, accounting for 35% of all overseas tourists in 2019.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to support businesses to access relevant Brexit business supports, to cut and contain costs, build value and drive competitiveness. Through its &lsquo;Get Brexit Ready&rsquo; programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a set of supports, to help tourism businesses meet Brexit-related challenges such as development supports, training programmes, and insights and market intelligence. Tourism businesses can also avail of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Brexit-check&rsquo; online tool allowing them to assess their own level of Brexit readiness. </p><p>Tourism Ireland is undertaking an extensive programme of research in our major markets &ndash; to identify when consumers are ready to consider holidaying again and which of our markets offer us the best short-term prospects. The insights gained will inform Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s new business plan and will ensure that Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s promotional plan is as targeted and as motivational as it possibly can be &ndash; in order to drive a strong recovery for tourism to the island of Ireland as quickly as it is possible to realise it.  </p><p>Officials from my Department and the tourism agencies remain in close contact as regards ensuring that appropriate contingency plans and other necessary resources are in place to assist in preparing for the end of the transition period.</p><p>The Government has put in place a range of supports and other resources to assist in preparing for the end of the transition period.  Businesses are encouraged to avail of these supports, and to get ready now if they have not already done so.  Acting now can help to mitigate the risks of disruption, delays and increased costs.</p><p>The Tourism Recovery Taskforce has completed its final report this week, which  includes a set of recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector, can adapt and recover. In the context of framing Budget 2021 and our impending National Economic Plan, I am reviewing the recommendations of the Taskforce with my colleagues in Government, as we consider the policy measures needed to facilitate sector growth in what will be a highly competitive and uniquely challenging environment for Irish tourism in a Post COVID-19 and Post Brexit world.</p></reply>

The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p>  <p>  With the upcoming Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures required as a consequence of COVID-19.</p></reply>

The sport sector has played a key role in supporting the public health by promoting key messages and many sports clubs throughout the country supported elderly and vulnerable members of their communities.  The sporting bodies have also done excellent work to develop and implement protocols for the safe return to training and competition, with guidance from Sport Ireland and the Expert Group on Return to Sport established by my Department.  </p>  <p>  It is thanks to this hard work that sport in Ireland has thankfully already recovered to a considerable extent, notwithstanding the acute financial and operational difficulties still being encountered. From early June, group training was successfully resumed and our elite athletes returned to training. Significant national competitive events are also taking place and sports participation levels across the population have also recovered. </p>  <p>   Sport Ireland continues to be extremely active in its sport promotional activities. Sport Ireland&rsquo;s network of Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) is the primary means employed to deliver participation policies and action. Research recently undertaken by Sport Ireland indicates significant increases in the number of people participating in sport and physical, especially in relation to recreational walking and cycling.  Sport Ireland are also currently assessing applications for funding from sports bodies as part of the &euro;70m package announced earlier in the Summer and plan to make announcements towards the end of October.</p>  <p>  Finally, we must all be aware that case numbers and hospitalisations continue to rise and continue our efforts to prevent transmission of infection in our communities and to limit our social contacts. I would ask all those involved in Irish sport, from elite to grassroots, to continue to observe public health advice and to take all appropriate precautions at training and sporting events.</p></reply>

The Plan outlines over 180 specific measures that are being implemented in conjunction with approximately 60 stakeholders on a cross-Departmental basis in support of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht. </p>  <p>  The Gaeltacht Act, 2012, provides the statutory footing for the language planning process. Under the process, Gaeltacht communities, and communities in Gaeltacht Service Towns and in Irish Language Networks as prescribed under the Act, are being afforded the opportunity to prepare and implement language plans at a community level with ongoing State support.  To date, 18 of 26 language plans relating to Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas have been approved under the process, in addition to three plans relating to the Irish Language Networks and two plans relating to Gaeltacht Service Towns. </p>  <p>  Further supports towards implementation of the process are provided centrally in the early years, family and youth sectors and for the traditional arts.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government also contains a commitment that the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 be enacted before the end of this year. I look forward to bringing the Bill back before the Houses at second stage shortly, at which time Oireachtas members will have the opportunity to discuss the Bill and put forward proposals for its amendment.</p>  <p>  I should also add that my Department provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many community language groups and to its six lead organisations, who are working to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.</p></reply>

This practical measure not only supports language enrichment opportunities but also supports the ongoing viability of second-level education provision on the Aran islands. Notwithstanding the unique challenges being presented by the ongoing pandemic, it is my hope that this measure can continue into the future when it is safe and practical to do so.</p><p>In the interests of completeness, I should also point out that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to support enterprise development on Gaeltacht offshore islands as part of its overall remit.  </p><p>On a general note, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to develop a new Policy for Island Development, which will identify and address the main challenges and opportunities to support the social, economic and cultural development of our island communities.  Prior to the transfer of functions a significant  amount of consultation in relation to the development of this policy was undertaken. This consultation will continue under the stewardship of the Department of Rural and Community Development in order to fully inform the new islands' policy.</p></reply>

The delays arise too as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 public health emergency and the effects this has had on travel and working arrangements.  While staff in the unit that deals with the issuing of licenses continued  to attend the office during the crisis, given restrictions, the numbers of such staff attending was, of course, limited.

There are 30 sluices south of Banagher. They are on two channels in parallel in the Meelick area with</p><p>- 18 sluices on the new cut; and</p><p>- 12 sluices on Meelick weir.</p><p>Waterways Ireland has stated that the operating procedure is as follows:</p><p>When water levels are indicated as being at 2.18 (35.41) metres on the gauge at Banagher and falling, sluices are closed on either the new cut or Meelick weir. This regime continues when all but 3 to 5 sluices are closed and water levels continue to fall. The weir boards are installed on the 57 bays of the weir to maintain water levels for Navigation purposes. The reverse applies when water levels at the gauge at Banagher exceed 2.18 metres and sluices are opened in the Meelick area and the weir boards removed.</p></reply>

The Scheme supports the aims and objectives of the Social, Scientific and Environmental Education (SSEE) curriculum and provides an additional educational tool and resource for teachers. The scheme is part-funded by the school and the Heritage Council.</p>  <p>  Visits generally relate to heritage in the locality of the school, and, in previous years, through the Scheme, the children could develop a knowledge and appreciation for the uniqueness of their locality through trips to local parks, woods, lakes, rivers, sea-shores, old graveyards, castles or churches or other places of interest through structured field trips with a Heritage specialist.</p>  <p>  While visits to schools have, of course, been on hold since mid-March 2020 due to COVID 19, the spirit of the scheme has been kept alive, and heritage specialists on the Panel were invited to make videos for promotion online. 30 online videos were developed, with the heritage specialists covering a vast range of topics from potato planting, folklore on herbs and  beetle identification to modelling archaeological sites out of papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; and singing traditional songs. These have proven very popular with family groups too and are, of course, available to families who are home-schooling. </p>  <p>  Public health remains the main priority of the Heritage Council, who will continue to play its part in keeping everyone safe. There are many factors to consider before the programme can open up to physical visits again, including a risk assessment on managing future processes for visits, as well as compliance with individual school COVID 19 policy statements and risk assessments. </p>  <p>  The Council is, however, working on a virtual programme which is being piloted in counties Donegal and Kilkenny, with the Education Centres and the Heritage Officers.  The response from schools so far has been very positive with approximately 90 requests for virtual visits registered to date. More detailed information on the videos, the virtual programme and the Heritage Council&rsquo;s other activities is available on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie or by contacting the Council directly.  </p>  <p>  While funding for parents who are home-schooling is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, the Heritage in Schools online material is available to all and can be found on the Heritage Council&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, the owners of dwellings located within the counties of Kildare, Meath or Offaly or the administrative areas of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown or South Dublin are eligible to apply for remediation works under the scheme and I have recently extended the pyrite remediation scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p>  <p>  &euro;20m was provided under Budget 2020 to cover the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approx. &euro;150m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014.</p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that up to 2,800 applications have been made under the Scheme and, so far, 2,286 dwellings have been included. A further 88 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, 119 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process and 238 applications were not successful. Of the 2,286 dwellings included, the works in respect of 2,001 are complete with the rest at various stages of progress.</p></reply>

The making or amending of such schemes under section 58 is an executive function and is subject to broad principles set out by my Department, including that rent levels should be based on income and reflect tenants&rsquo; ability to pay.</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the sources of income which are included and disregarded for rent assessment purposes are a matter for individual local authorities.  Different approaches are taken to rent charging and setting across the country.  Schemes define assessable income on which the rent is calculated and detail a list of sources of income (including social welfare payments) considered assessable and payments that are excluded.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to bringing forward a package of social housing reforms, which includes standardising the differential rents regime across the country to ensure fairness.  Standardisation would include the treatment of income disregards.  Work on the review of the current rent schemes has been ongoing and I have asked my Department to prepare recommendations regarding the potential for a standardised local authority rents system, which I will consider in due course as part of the package of social housing reforms.  The respective roles of the executive and elected members will be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

Under section 179(3) of the Act, the Chief Executive of the local authority is also required to submit a report on the proposed development, taking account of the public submissions received, for consideration of the elected members of the Council.

If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021):</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further information available at - ); or</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance);</p><p>and</p><p>- at risk of losing their tenancy,</p><p>can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021. </p><p>In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the Residential Tenancies Boards (RTB) website - www.rtb.ie, if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy. </p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - <i>www.housing.gov.ie -</i>and on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie.</p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>Many Government Departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Social Welfare Allowances are available to assist them.  Further information on these supports can be found by calling the DEASP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the DEASP website at:</p><p>.</p><p>With Government funding, Threshold, the national housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service. Further information is available on www.threshold.ie. The homeless and housing sections in local authorities continue to assist those who are not in a position to provide accommodation for themselves.</p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on www.rtb.ie.</p><p>For tenancies other than those in rent arrears, the existing laws on how to end a tenancy apply again from 2 August 2020. Tenancy terminations are permitted to be served in such cases and tenants must vacate on the termination date specified in a valid Notice of Termination.</p><p>For all landlords who served a Notice of Termination before the enactment of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 on 27 March 2020 and had the termination notice period paused, those notice periods recommenced with effect from 2 August 2020.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act  2020 targets enhanced protections to the most vulnerable tenants until 10 January 2021 and respects the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.</p></reply>

Under section 181(1) of the Act, where a planning authority is satisfied that a development has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the permission and any conditions to which the permission is subject, the planning authority is obliged to initiate the taking in charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings in question. </p>  <p>  A planning authority may not necessarily take in charge an entire development, and it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make its determination regarding individual developments. Under Section 180(4)(b) of the Act, a planning authority may take in charge some or all of the sewers, water mains, service connections, public open spaces or public car parks within the attendant grounds of the development when an order is made under section 11(1) of the Roads Act 1993. In effect, a planning authority may decide not to take in charge certain elements of a development. A declaration under Section 11 of the Roads Act 1993, which marks the formal completion of the taking in charge process following a proposal by the executive, is a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority. Pending the formal adoption of such a declaration by the elected members, the maintenance of the development remains the responsibility of the developer or the management company in place even where the taking in charge process has been initiated.</p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.

There are significant variances in their abilities to raise revenue locally and they therefore require differing levels of financial support. Until the introduction of local retention of Local Property Tax (LPT) in 2015, this support took the form of General Purpose Grants (GPGs). When allocating GPGs, regard was had to each local authority&rsquo;s income and expenditure, the overall amount of funding available for allocation and the need to provide each local authority with a baseline allocation that would ensure its financial stability.</p>  <p>  2014 was the final year of GPG allocations. The 2014 GPG allocations also recognised the move of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014. Accordingly, 2014 GPG allocations are not directly comparable to previous years.  </p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015, when LPT allocations replaced GPGs.  At that time, the Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than it received from its GPG allocation in 2014. Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 took account of the historical GPG funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area. For 2017 onwards, the LPT baseline of each local authority was increased to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction income retained by local authorities in 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the then Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform initiated an Inter-Departmental review of LPT. The purpose of the review was to inform the Minister in relation to any actions he may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. The review was informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons. While the LPT Review was completed last year, having considered the findings of the Review, the Minister for Finance decided to defer the revaluation date for LPT purposes to 1 November 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the revaluation has now been deferred until 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that in future all LPT collected will be retained in the county in which is collected. This is to be done on the basis that that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer. My Department will advance work on the implementation of this committment in the coming months.</p></reply>

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  In May last year F&oacute;rsa trade union tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 pay agreement.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies are in discussions with F&oacute;rsa under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p>  <p>  The matter is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and Exchequer cost issues. The survey undertaken last year established that the ultimate full-year pay cost of all of the elements of F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s claim, that is to pay secretaries and caretakers on the maximum of the scale at full hours, is in the region of &euro;50 million per annum, with a further substantial cost of approximately &euro;36m for the provision of pension. </p>  <p>  I must also remain cognisant that the implications arising from this claim impact across the wider education and public sector.  In 2017 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carried out a detailed scoping exercise in relation to pension provision for staff in the Community and Voluntary Sector. The result illustrated that this matter presents very significant implications for the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The talks are set to resume in the WRC this Thursday 1st October. In these circumstances I regret F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s announcement on the 28th of September of an immediate survey of it its members on the resumption of the industrial action in which members were engaged in January this year.   </p>  <p>  The WRC is the most appropriate forum for these discussions to take place and I support the continued dialogue between all parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution.</p></reply>

We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But in order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.   It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.   The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. </p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level.  The Junior Cycle data for2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.</p></reply>

All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation. </p><p>My Department has issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year.  All children using school transport scheme services are asked to comply with a number of guidelines including that all children on post-primary transport services are required to wear facemasks while waiting for and on-board transport services (with the exception of children who for medical or special educational needs reasons are not in a position to wear a facemask or face covering).</p><p>The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity. </p><p>An assessment of the resources required to implement physical distancing on all post-primary services has been undertaken and, in line with the Government decision of 18<sup>th</sup>August, the Department has reviewed this information in consultation with other relevant Departments. </p><p>I am pleased to announce that, following a Government Decision on the 29th of September, Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure full implementation of the measures required for the operation of school transport for post-primary children that is aligned to updated health advice received from NPHET on the 18<sup>th</sup>of August, for which the estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. </p><p>If there are individual concerns about a particular service, parents/guardians are advised to contact School Transport Section of my Department or their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office.</p></reply>

The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual application system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals.

In order to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants, a flat payment rate was introduced. This rate was the equivalent of the rate for a two-person household. </p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment moved to 2 rates of payment, and a 3 rate structure is in place since 17 September. These changes more closely link the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned and make the scheme more targeted and fair. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account. </p>  <p>  The rate of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a self-employed person is calculated by reference to their reckonable income in either 2018 or 2019, whichever is the greater.  Details of reckonable income are supplied to the Department by the Revenue Commissioners, and are supplied net of business related costs, including capital allowances.  When submitting returns to the Revenue Commissioners, self-employed persons can offset business related costs against gross trading income, with the resulting assessment to tax and PRSI based on net profits.  In that regard, capital allowances are available in respect of qualifying capital expenditure incurred on the provision of certain assets in use for the purposes of a trade or business. They effectively allow a taxpayer to write off the cost of an asset over a period of time and to reduce their reckonable income as a result.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.</p></reply>

Issues such as the time which has elapsed since a previous review was undertaken and where information is received which suggest a review may be warranted can also trigger a review.</p>  <p>  Social Welfare Inspectors (SWIs) are appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) and are required to investigate and report on customer&rsquo;s claims.  Social Welfare Inspectors (SWIs) operate under a code of practice which sets out the manner in which they are required to deal with the public.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. </p>  <p>   My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before end of the year . It is intended that awarded and closed cases will be identified for arrears payments at the same time. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The distance to be measured is the shortest non-tolled most direct route from the student&rsquo;s residence to the institution attended. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of students whose normal residence is 45km or less from the approved institution which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p>  <p>  The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for SUSI, the grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the awarding authority shall establish:</p>  <p>  - the method for measuring a route; and</p>  <p>  - the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p>  <p>  SUSI has progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures was the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants.</p>  <p>  The distance is always measured from the student's normal residence to the campus the student is attending and never the reverse. The distance is always measured avoiding tolls.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for student grant assistance is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. </p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing. These additional places meant that as of Round Two 63,338 applicants have received a CAO offer, more than in any previous year.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I appreciate how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.</p></reply>

The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

The approach being taken is one of progressive realisation, with work continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD. Minister Rabbitte chairs the Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, the most recent meeting of which took place on the 29th of September 2020. This Group has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group recently carried out a mid-term review of the Strategy which examined how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. Arising from the mid-term review, a commitment was made that the Department of Justice and Equality will develop a CRPD implementation plan, that will include monitoring structures and metrics as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and running effectively by ensuring that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place.</p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the first instance my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the amendment of:</p>  <p>  - the Juries Act to accommodate (i) deaf persons who need the services of a sign language interpreter and (ii) persons with mental illness being subject to a functional capacity test;</p>  <p>  - the Electoral Act to repeal the prohibition on a person of unsound mind from standing for election to the national and European parliament;</p>  <p>  - the Disability Act to (i) change the status of NDA staff from public to civil servants, in line with all other bodies in the Justice Vote, (ii) to provide information and advice including statistics to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and (iii) to bring An Garda Siochana within its scope; </p>  <p>  - the Equal Status Act to elaborate the principle of refusal of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; on grounds of cost;</p>  <p>  - the IHREC Act to create a statutory basis for IHREC to (i) keep under review the law and practice relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, and (ii) to that end appoint an advisory committee, and (iii) apply to the Court of Appeal to appear as amicus curiae (friend of the court).</p>  <p>  The Bill was at Committee Stage when it lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020. A decision is now required as to whether the lapsed Bill should be revisited, or if a new Bill should be drafted. This will be a decision for the new Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration once the transfer of functions from the Minister for Justice and Equality has taken place.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework for implementation of the Convention will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the NDA and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the Government priorities remain focused on addressing the remaining legislative measures to be taken to give full effect to the Convention, the Programme for Government also reiterates the commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol after the first reporting cycle.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I am progressing a range of new Bills relating to Garda governance and policing powers. It is my intention to repeal the provisions currently contained in Section 38 of the 2005 Act, and to replace them with provisions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill.  I hope to bring the general scheme of that Bill to Government for approval very soon.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the applications from Littleton the Deputy has referred to, I am informed that the application for a Community Based Scheme under Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, has not met the standard to be heard at the CCTV Advisory Committee (which makes recommendations to the Garda Commissioner) due to issues in respect of the location of the server.  It had been proposed that the server would be based in the local Garda Station and that the local Superintendent would act as Data Controller. This is at variance with S.I. 289/06 which stipulates that the Local Authority will act as Data Controller.

The charge would be reduced by &euro;0.50c to &euro;1 per item for the over 70s and by &euro;0.50c to &euro;1.50 for persons under 70. The maximum monthly charge would also be reduced to &euro;10 and &euro;15 respectively.</p><p>- The monthly threshold of &euro;124 for the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) would be reduced by &euro;10 to &euro;114 per household.</p><p>Although it was intended that these measures would be implemented, funding of this Budget 2020 commitment was contingent on the achievement of certain savings within the health budget.</p><p>However, these savings have not been achieved as the Pandemic has placed a significant demand on public finances, a substantial proportion of which has been allocated to the health system.

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission, and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p><p>Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. The Framework was informed by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p><p>It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Under Level 3 for Donegal, people living in Donegal should remain in the county, with the exception of those who must travel for work, education and other essential purposes. People living outside of Donegal should not travel to Donegal, with the exception of those who must travel for work, education and other essential purposes. The purpose of these measures is to prevent further transmission of Covid-19 outside of Donegal.</p><p>While weddings with up to 25 people are permitted in Level 3 and can currently take place in Donegal, there is no exemption from the current travel restrictions for attending a wedding. This means that it will not be possible for residents outside of Donegal to attend weddings in Donegal, nor will it be possible for those in Donegal to attend weddings in other areas of the country. Again, this measure is in place to prevent further transmission of Covid-19 outside of Donegal. The Deputy may wish to note that there is one exception to this. Couples resident in Donegal with existing plans outside the county can travel to get married at another location, subject to the county level restrictions in place at that location. This applies only to the couple getting married and does not extend to guests attending the wedding.</p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place for Donegal under Level 3 can be found at .</p></reply>

This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA undertook a regulatory inspection of the nursing home referred to by the Deputy and as part of this met with residents and their families, including the families of some of those who passed away as a result of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Following this inspection, HIQA is satisfied to re-register the nursing home with several improvement focused conditions including in relation to individual assessment and care planning. In their role as regulator, HIQA will continue to inspect individual nursing homes including the nursing home referred to by the Deputy to ensure their compliance with any conditions imposed. </p>  <p>  On 19 August 2020, both Minister Donnelly and I launched the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report.  This is a significant piece of work which provides a range of recommendations in line with lessons learned to date and international best practice, aimed to safeguard the residents in nursing homes over the next 12-18 months and into the longer term. The report is also informative in identifying areas of older persons&rsquo; service and care delivery requiring consideration for further reform. Many of these themes are reflected in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>   Implementing the Report&rsquo;s short-term recommendations will ensure the ongoing protection of nursing home residents, the preparedness of the nursing homes sector and the health system in response to COVID-19 and the winter ahead. This will involve building on emerging good practice.</p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult a time it is for the families of those who passed away as a result of COVID-19 and would like to express my condolences to those who have lost a loved one during this period.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>In 2020, the NHSS saw a further investment in its budget, to bring it to &euro;1.07bn for the year. This significant investment will provide ongoing long-term residential care over the course of 2020 ensuring that the Scheme continues to deliver affordable and accessible nursing home care for our citizens with long-term care needs.</p><p>Separately, as part of package of support measures for nursing homes, my Department established a COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS), which opened for applications on 17th April 2020. The core concept of the scheme is that the State will provide additional funding to those nursing homes that require it, to contribute towards costs associated with COVID-19 preparedness, mitigation and outbreak management. The scheme was originally devised to operate for a 3-month period to the end of June, this scheme was extended to the end of September. The scheme is now being further extended to the end of 2020 and for the first 6 months of 2021 (end June 2021). </p><p>As the Deputy's question regarding the estimated full-year cost of the current levels of nursing home care provided through the public health system relates to service matters I have arranged for his correspondence to be referred to the HSE for consideration and direct reply to him.</p></reply>

Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. Initial indications are that the costs arising from this agreement will be in the region of &euro;305 million euros (subject to verification).</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement  which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both essential care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. The negotiations in the event of a surge are ongoing.  </p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. Tenders have been received and are currently being evaluated by the HSE. In the meantime, the Department has approved a HSE temporary arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals pending the finalisation of the national procurement process.

This model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent, responsive and flexible service, with sufficient capacity to take us through the winter months and beyond. This plan includes recruitment of a permanent dedicated workforce for for Covid-19 Testing and contact tracing which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements to be rolled out quickly.  For example, the HSE is currently recruiting over 700 people to take swabs and over 500 contact tracing staff all around the country.</p>  <p>  This future model is currently being finalised by the HSE and will be submitted to the Department, together with costings, in the near future.</p></reply>

Therefore, to date, cost estimates in respect of saliva sample testing have not been created.  </p><p>The collection of nasopharyngeal swabs by healthcare workers involves an invasive technique that is uncomfortable for the patient, which is of particular concern for paediatric populations. A relative degree of skill is required by the provider, and due to risk of transmission, the procedure necessitates substantial personal protective equipment. Other issues include the potential for a shortage of swabs during large scale testing initiatives. Alternative specimens from the upper respiratory tract, such as saliva or nasal, may offer a means to mitigate these limitations.  <b></b></p><p>In light of this, an Evidence Review to inform this consideration was published by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on 21st August 2020.  HIQA is currently in the process of updating this review in light of the ongoing developments in the field.  </p><p>This issue continues to be under active consideration by the NPHET.</p></reply>

The HSE has over recent weeks ramped up resources significantly, and will continue to do so, including optimising and maximising our laboratory testing capacity.</p><p>The current Testing pathway consists of a number of stages:</p><p>-  On referral from a GP, an appointment is made for an individual at a Testing Centre,</p><p>-  Swab is taken from the individual.</p><p>-  Swab has then to be transferred to a Laboratory for testing.</p><p>-  Result is recorded and advised to Centre. </p><p>-  Individual is informed of result.</p><p>The HSE are constantly monitoring all stages of the process to increase efficiency of each of the individual components of the testing pathway and to reduce the turnaround times as much as possible.</p><p>Earlier this year, the HSE estimated maximum potential costs for testing and contact tracing for the full year of &euro;414 million. This figure should be considered an estimate of the maximum costs as it is based on activity levels of 100,000 tests per week every week, and actual costs may be lower and reflective of actual activity levels earlier in the year. </p><p>The Government has to date approved just over &euro;200 million to cover the costs of testing and contact tracing this year.  The estimated expenditure on testing and contact tracing to 18 September was &euro;120.96m. </p><p>The Covid Tracker App was introduced to complement the manual contact tracing system and integrate into it, and did not replace any element of it. Therefore, no reductions in staff resulted. In fact, in recent weeks the number of staff engaged daily in Contact Tracing has increased significantly to almost 300.  Furthermore, the HSE is currently in the process of recruiting over 500 contact tracing staff all around the country.</p></reply>

This reform will continue when the Pandemic Framework, currently the immediate priority for the HSE, is finalised.</p>  <p>  Teams are now in place in my Department and the HSE working on a related business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform seeking consultant status and remuneration and this will be completed and submitted as soon as possible.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-01a.800.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100100085#WRO05100"><p>Protection of the vulnerable continues to be a Government priority, especially in these challenging times, and those with mental health issues are often among the most vulnerable in society.</p>  <p>  Access to services is central to the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sl&aacute;intecare and the new national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, and the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future highlights these policies. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.</p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland has fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas, including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life. </p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.</p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.</p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.</p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.</p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psychosocial strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for frontline workers from Turn2me.</p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.</p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of Sharing the Vision. This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s determination to meet this challenge is demonstrated by its decision to invest an additional &euro;600m in health services this winter - &euro;200m in 2020 and &euro;400m in 2021 - to support the roll-out of the winter-specific measures. </p>  <p>  The HSE published its Winter Plan on 24 September. The HSE Winter Plan aims to reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission by 30% and to improve Patient Experience Times, particularly in terms of keeping everyone safe while we respond to Covid-19. It aims to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible by providing a better service in community health care settings; to receive timely care in hospital when this is necessary; and to return home or to appropriate care settings when fit to leave hospital by providing more homecare and stepdown options. It aims to deliver 4.76 million more home support hours to facilitate this.</p>  <p>  There are additional supports in the HSE Winter Plan for people at greater risk including the elderly, homeless, and those with chronic illnesses to allow them to stay at home. It also provides additional Community Healthcare Networks, 36 more Community Specialist Teams and 11 additional acute hospital &lsquo;Front of House&rsquo; Frailty Intervention Teams. This will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care will be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan aims to deliver 79,000 more diagnostics in the community, again allowing patients to be seen closer to home and avoid going to hospital. The Plan puts in place supports for GPs, particularly those in rural practices, to support service continuity. A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme. The HSE has placed orders for approximately 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine, as well as 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, which will be made available to children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

Day care and respite services have been suspended, and usual routines have been disrupted, creating additional pressures for people with dementia and their family carers.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE have ensured that there has been a continued focus on meeting the needs of people living with dementia throughout the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through the Dementia Understand Together Campaign, led by the HSE and working with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (ASI), a range of initiatives and resources have been developed, to ensure that people living with dementia stay safe, well and connected, during this time of crisis. The HSE is also signposting people with dementia to voluntary organisations for additional community supports.</p>  <p>  The HSE has adapted its community services in order to provide a flexible response so that the needs of people with dementia continue to be met during the Covid-19 crisis. Primary care team support is operating nationwide, with referrals being made to community supports, including the ASI&rsquo;s dementia adviser service and the local authority community response forums. While home visits have been necessarily restricted, the HSE uses prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients needing home visits.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are undertaking work to determine the current level of service delivery in the community and to set out plans, including associated required capacity, to resume services, including day services, in line with the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. This process will take on board the learning of the current period, including the possibility of delivering services in a new way, and the requirement to adhere to public health guidance. As part of this process, the National Dementia Office is developing a new model of care for dementia.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Memory Technology Resource Rooms (MTRRs) now have a central line, where people can speak to an occupational therapist for advice on Assistive Technology and aids to support people at home. The majority of MTRRs are now providing an adapted service through telephone and video assessment and consultation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the ASI continues to support people throughout the Covid-19 crisis: its live chat, national helpline, home care, dementia adviser service, and online family carer training all remain up and running. Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s have moved on-line and &lsquo;virtual caf&eacute;s&rsquo; are now taking place. The ASI has launched a new nurse line initiative with backing from the HSE and the Department of Health. The free call-back service offers people with dementia and family carers the opportunity to book a 1:1 session with a Dementia Nurse or a Dementia Adviser during the Covid-19 public health emergency. This creates a space for people with dementia and / or their families to raise issues that may be arising for them during the cocooning phase of the Covid-19 Emergency. This is hoped to assist people and may help plug the gap where Geriatrician appointments have had to be postponed due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Guidance for re-opening day centres, including those for people with dementia, has been issued to CHOs. CHOs have been requested to undertake local risk assessments of centres to determine if infection, prevention and control measures can be put in place, to determine if social distancing can be maintained and in addition in order to determine approach to transporting clients to and from centres.</p>  <p>  Advice issued from NPHET is that the over-70s, as medically vulnerable people, should continue to cocoon and not be in congregated settings. This cannot be facilitated in day centres unless the number of clients attending services are reduced. The HSE is committed to reopening day services but needs to determine Covid-19 testing strategy for these clients; mindful of increasing Covid-19 community transmission and resolve issues related to physical environments at day centres and ensure a safe transport strategy to facilitate people&rsquo;s attendance at day centres.</p></reply>

As issues around the resumption of disability day services are COVID specific, funding was sought from the National Action Plan on COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Of this &euro;10 million, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. &euro;2.5 million will provide 210 intensive support packages to enable children and young adults to remain at home and in their communities. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will further support the resumption of day services, which began to gradually resume throughout August and September. However, it should be noted that capacity in day service locations will be reduced, in line with public health guidance. The HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly. Both the HSE and service providers are committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions.  </p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations reopened around the country is available. This information can be accessed at www.hse.ie/newdirections</p>  <p>  With regard to respite services, the HSE&rsquo;s A Safe Return to Health Services outlines a three phased approach to the return of health and social care services. In accordance with this plan, short-stay residential and emergency/residential respite re-opened from July to August with activity set to increase in the next two phases; September &ndash; November and December 2020 to February 2021. The main assumption underpinning this schedule is the level of illness and health service pressure caused by COVID-19. If this increases in later surges, the timelines in this document will change.</p>  <p>  Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided, and so services and supports for those in long term residential settings continue. Where some regular activities for people with disabilities in long term residential care, such as attending separate day services, are curtailed, alternative supports are provided in the residential setting.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is very much aware of how difficult restrictions on visiting are for residents and their families, and it is hoped that re-introduction of restrictions can be minimised. As Dublin city and county has been placed on Level 3 of the Framework for Restrictive Measures, it is unfortunately the case that visits to long term residential care facilities are paused until Friday 9th of October, but service providers are asked to take account of exceptional circumstances and facilitate visits on critical or compassionate grounds where needed. All guidance is available on the HSPC website and reviewed regularly.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.  In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review.</p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.  Each maternity service/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.</p></reply>

These organisms may be associated with a variety of internationally traded plants, plant products including wood and wood packaging material such as crates and pallets which can be associated with goods of any kind. </p>  <p>  In order to address this potential threat of introduction of a harmful organism in this manner and to protect the health of Ireland&rsquo;s forest resource, there is comprehensive legislation in place which describes particular import requirements for a range of commodities from origins where the presence of harmful forest pests and disease is known to occur. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the Plant Health Regulation EU 2016/2031 and Official Controls Regulation EU 2017/625 which came into effect from the 14th December 2019 describe import controls for a range of wood and wood products from Third Countries and from within the EU in order to prevent the entry &amp;amp; spread of non-indigenous quarantine harmful organisms. </p>  <p>  Under the legislation, Ireland has &ldquo;Protected Zone&rdquo; status within the EU for a range of forestry harmful organisms.  This status recognises in legal terms the freedom from their presence in Ireland, despite having conditions which are suitable for their establishment should they be introduced.</p>  <p>  This legislation allows Ireland to implement more stringent import requirements on certain commodities than would be the case were these commodities moved between other EU Member States.  In the case of the importation of coniferous logs from continental Europe, Ireland has additional phytosanitary import requirements and controls as described which permit the movement of this commodity into Protected Zones. If the logs satisfy the import requirements they can  move, which is in line with the operation of the EU Single Market.</p></reply>

The most up to date estimates of expected 2020 expenditure on the TB Programme are also presented.</p><p>The overall cost of the TB Programme has increased from &euro;86.4 million in 2017 to an estimated &euro;97.3 million in 2020 (+&euro;10.9 million or 13%). In that time, the primary drivers of increased costs have been:</p><p>- Compensation +&euro;6.2 million</p><p>- DAFM staff costs and admin +&euro;1.6 million</p><p>- DAFM paid TB testing +&euro;1.5 million</p><p>Compensation increases largely relate to higher incidence of disease. DAFM staff cost increases primarily reflect an additional 16 posts sanctioned in 2020 to assist the TB Eradication Programme at an estimated cost of &euro;1 million per annum. Farmers pay their Private Veterinary Practitioner for the annual round test and DAFM pay for all other consequential testing which occurs. The number of consequential tests has increased since 2017 reflecting higher disease incidence. This cost has been met by DAFM.</p><p>The TB Programme is financed by farmers, the Exchequer and the EU. Farmer contributions to the Programme since 2017 have been broadly stable reflecting the mechanism through which they contribute to the Programme. Farmer contributions relate to the assumed annual cost to the farmer of TB testing and receipts from bovine disease levies. The contribution from the EU has fallen sharply by &euro;4.4 million between 2017 and 2020 reflecting reduced funding ceilings and penalties related to deteriorating disease incidence. Based on Programme metrics to date for 2020, my Department is expecting a further 20% funding penalty (&euro;1.1 million) to be imposed in respect of 2020. This will be subject to decision by the Commission in mid-2021. </p><p>The significant increase in Programme costs allied with reductions in EU funding has seen Exchequer funding of the TB Programme rise from &euro;41.7 million in 2017 to a forecast &euro;57 million in 2020 (+&euro;15.3 million or 37%). This level of increase in investment is not sustainable.</p><p>I have convened a TB Stakeholder Forum for 1 October which I will attend. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective and from a trade perspective at national and at international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned.  I want to work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this on-going cost on farmers and the State.</p><p><b>TB Programme Expenditure and Financing</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Expenditure</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Staff   &amp;amp; Admin Costs</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DAFM Staff Costs &amp;amp; Admin</td>       <td>&euro;26,924</td>       <td>&euro;27,029</td>       <td>&euro;27,502</td>       <td>&euro;28,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supplies </td>       <td>&euro;4,839</td>       <td>&euro;4,376</td>       <td>&euro;4,426</td>       <td>&euro;5,278</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wildlife   Programme</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wildlife Programme</td>       <td>&euro;3,465</td>       <td>&euro;3,635</td>       <td>&euro;4,040</td>       <td>&euro;4,568</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PVP   Testing</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Farmer Paid PVP Testing</td>       <td>&euro;27,908</td>       <td>&euro;27,746</td>       <td>&euro;27,400</td>       <td>&euro;27,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DAFM Paid PVP Testing</td>       <td>&euro;7,028</td>       <td>&euro;7,313</td>       <td>&euro;8,541</td>       <td>&euro;8,498</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;34,936</td>       <td>&euro;35,059</td>       <td>&euro;35,941</td>       <td>&euro;35,898</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Compensation   Scheme</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>On Farm Market Valuation</td>       <td>&euro;10,500</td>       <td>&euro;14,255</td>       <td>&euro;14,047</td>       <td>&euro;16,388</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Compensation - Other</td>       <td>&euro;3,545</td>       <td>&euro;3,832</td>       <td>&euro;3,674</td>       <td>&euro;3,706</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Valuer Fees</td>       <td>&euro;539</td>       <td>&euro;548</td>       <td>&euro;602</td>       <td>&euro;740</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbitration</td>       <td>&euro;15</td>       <td>&euro;11</td>       <td>&euro;10</td>       <td>&euro;10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;14,599</td>       <td>&euro;18,646</td>       <td>&euro;18,333</td>       <td>&euro;20,845</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Research</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>bTB Research</td>       <td>&euro;1,666</td>       <td>&euro;1,618</td>       <td>&euro;1,136</td>       <td>&euro;2,225</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;86,429</td>       <td>&euro;90,363</td>       <td>&euro;91,378</td>       <td>&euro;97,314</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financing</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Farmers</td>       <td>&euro;34,845</td>       <td>&euro;35,101</td>       <td>&euro;34,768</td>       <td>&euro;34,882</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU</td>       <td>&euro;9,851</td>       <td>&euro;8,773</td>       <td>&euro;7,425</td>       <td>&euro;5,420</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Exchequer</td>       <td>&euro;41,733</td>       <td>&euro;46,489</td>       <td>&euro;49,185</td>       <td>&euro;57,012</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;86,429</td>       <td>&euro;90,363</td>       <td>&euro;91,378</td>       <td>&euro;97,314</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Methodology notes:</p><p>- DAFM has assumed that farmers privately pay the same rate as the Department to Private Veterinary Practitioners for PVP testing. This helps derive the farmer paid testing estimate of &euro;27.4 million which is assumed to be unchanged in 2020 from 2019</p><p>- In calculating DAFM staff costs, DAFM surveyed internal staff across policy, laboratories, Regional Veterinary Offices etc. in 2018 to determine the proportion of time allocated to the TB Programme. It is estimated that 620 staff within DAFM spend at least part of their time  implementing the TB Programme. 2020 calculations include the sanctioning of an additional 16 staff to assist the TB Programme</p><p>- While the EU has sanctioned a &euro;5.42 million contribution for Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 TB Programme, DAFM is anticipating this will be reduced by 20% (&euro;1.1 million) reflecting deteriorating disease statistics. This would directly result in the Exchequer contribution exceeding &euro;58 million in 2020 based on current estimates.</p></reply>

It is not currently proposed to amend the payment rates across the various categories of land within the scheme.</p><p>Payments under the 2020 ANC Scheme commenced on schedule in mid September.  I am happy to confirm that the first tranche of payments issued to 86,000 farmers which was a significant increase on the 79,000 farmers paid in the first tranche in 2019.  Regular pay runs are in place to pay cases as they become clear for payments, and as of 25 September a total of &euro;187.2 million has issued to over 87,000 farmers.</p></reply>

In additon, where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground.</p><p>Furthermore, the actual inspection process cannot commence until the application process (including the option for the submission of amendments and the preliminary checks process) has been completed.  It is only at this point that the final position on the lands being declared is known. </p><p>Given the various stages in the process, there can be variation year to year but invariably a significant amount of progress is made on these cases during September each year.  Accordingly, the following table details the position on the number of remote sensing inspections for which inspection results were received at 1st September and 30th September for each of the years 2015 to 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total No. of Remote Sensing Inspections</th>       <th>No. of Remote Sensing Inspections with inspection results received @ 1st  September</th>       <th>No. of Remote Sensing Inspections with inspection results received @ 30th September</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>6,811</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2,355</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>6,219</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3,016</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>6,508</td>       <td>1,612</td>       <td>3,817</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>6,845</td>       <td>1,002</td>       <td>3,722</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>6,845</td>       <td>436</td>       <td>3,808</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>6,483</td>       <td>685</td>       <td>3,536</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
