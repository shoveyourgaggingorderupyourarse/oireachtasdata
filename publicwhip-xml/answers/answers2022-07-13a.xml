Nevertheless, I can report that, in a record year for trade, the value of goods imported into Ireland in 2021 from the EU26 increased by &euro;4 billion, from &euro;30.3 billion to &euro;34.3 billion, or 13% compared to 2020, representing 33% of total imports.</p>  <p>  Ireland of course benefits from our status as integral part of the EU Single Market, which allows for the continuing growth of two-way trade with other EU countries, and indeed allows Irish companies to benefit from the EU's growing network of Free Trade Agreements with countries around the world, the most recent of which, namely the FTA with New Zealand, was signed earlier this month in Brussels. I would of course investigate any instance of companies refusing to supply products to Ireland owing to Brexit-related matters. The Government is continuing to support Irish enterprises as they deal with the consequences of the UK leaving the EU.</p></reply>

The level of total direct employment in IDA client companies grew by 7% in 2021, to 275,384. Over half of all projects went to regional locations.</p>  <p>  When we look at the base of FDI Biopharma companies established here, we can see that this sector has experienced great success in recent decades, with many largescale life sciences investments being made. Ireland&rsquo;s Biopharma sector has a substantial economic impact and is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, and accounts for a substantial amount of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax. Nine of the of the top 10 global Biopharma companies have significant manufacturing operations within Ireland. The combined Biopharma and MedTech cluster in Ireland provides direct employment to over 80,000 people. </p>  <p>  The sector is thriving, and IDA&rsquo;s Biopharma clients have continued to expand, with 14 Biopharma clients announcing significant expansions in Ireland over the last twelve months. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies are reviewing their supply chains to ensure that their global manufacturing is evenly distributed globally, and Ireland is well placed to benefit from this development.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment, despite COVID-19 and a downturn in global FDI. IDA is adapting its responses to changes in global economic circumstances and it continues to secure high levels of FDI investment in a very competitive market. Nevertheless, we must remain alert to any competitiveness issues that may risk constraining our capacity for future success.  </p></reply>

One of the main features of the Act is the creation of a new State consent, the Maritime Area Consent, as a first step in new and streamlined planning process.   To enable achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 targets, a pathway was provided for in the Act to permit a select number of projects which had advanced under the existing Foreshore regime, to transition to the new regime once established.</p>  <p>  The Transition Protocol, as set out in the General Scheme of the then Marine Planning and Development Management (MPDM) Bill gave guidance regarding the treatment of certain offshore wind projects in the context of the anticipated progression of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Bill. These &lsquo;Relevant Projects&rsquo; either applied for or were granted a lease under the Foreshore Act 1933, or were eligible to be processed to receive a valid grid connection offer in December 2019.</p>  <p>  The Protocol allowed these projects to continue to progress a number of project elements, so that they could be in a position to apply under the new marine planning regime once the legislation was enacted. </p>  <p>  Under the special transition provisions in the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Climate Communications has the responsibility for assessing and granting Maritime Area Consents (MACs) for this first batch of offshore projects. These &lsquo;Relevant Projects&rsquo; are the projects which satisfy the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; under the legislation. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the developer referred to in the question wrote to the two relevant Ministers advising of their intention to apply for a Maritime Area Consent and no longer progress their application under the Foreshore Act, given the energy project satisfies the definition of relevant maritime usage under Section 100 of the MAP Act. The project is now being progressed by the developer under the MAC regime.</p></reply>

NBI has further advised that over 63,600 premises are passed with a high speed fibre broadband service across 23 counties and available for immediate connection. Construction is complete or underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with projections with some areas exceeding expectations. NBI has advised that in County Roscommon there are currently 4,191 premises passed with a high speed fibre broadband service and available for immediate connection.</p><p>The area referred to in the Question in County Roscommon falls within the Castlerea Deployment Area under the NBP.NBI has confirmed that the Engineering Surveys for this Deployment Area are now fully complete.  The new broadband network in this Deployment Area will serve approximately 4,264 premises.  An initial anticipated date for live connections in this area was publicised by NBI as being between April 2023 &ndash; June 2023.Following the completion of the Engineering Surveys NBI&rsquo;s team has greater visibility of the extent of the work that will be necessary, including pre-works, duct remediation and pole replacement, in order to successfully deploy fibre services in the area.  As such NBI has revised the anticipated date for live connections in the Castlerea Deployment area to between October 2023 &ndash; December 2023. NBI contractors are now proceeding to the detailed Design Phase of the project which will be followed by the Network Build.  Members of the public can monitor the progress of this work on the NBI website, <i>www.nbi.ie</i>or sign-up for email updates about their specific Eircode at www.nbi.ie/eoi.  NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie/reps</p><p>Since January 2020, NBI has mobilised the staff, subcontractors, infrastructure and material providers required to deliver the NBP and has advised that, as of 1 July 2022, is currently providing direct and indirect employment to 1,442 people. These staffing levels continue to increase as the project ramps up.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 644 BCP sites have been installed by NBI, as of 1 July 2022, and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Roscommon 9 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed by NBI to date.  Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie/broadband-connection-points/</i>.</p><p>In County Roscommon 6 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>.</p></reply>

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p><p>In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing the National Hub Network, the Network's shared online booking platform connectedhubs.ie, adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure and supporting the establishment of new hubs.</p><p>Over &euro;100m has been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p><p>On 8 June, I announced that 81 projects across the country were successful in securing funding via the Connected Hubs Call 2022, allocating &euro;5 million in funding to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. This follows the award of almost &euro;9M under the Connected Hubs Call in 2021.</p><p>In addition to the National Hub Network, my department is working closely with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) to establish the nationwide network of Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). </p><p>BCPs are publicly accessible facilities, typically community centres and sports clubs, in predominantly rural and isolated areas. These facilities offer onsite internet access for a variety of community uses, including skills training and STEM activities for children and young people, eHealth initiatives and remote working. To date 273 of 300 sites are live, with the remainder scheduled for completion this year.</p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the National Hub Network and the BCP network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of both projects, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, with local authorities and communities, and with other stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network, the <i>connectedhubs.ie</i>platform and the BCP program. <table>    <tr>       <th>Programme Scheme</th>       <th>Subhead</th>       <th>2021 &euro;'000</th>       <th>2022 &euro;'000</th>       <th>Change</th>       <th>% Change</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Environmental Protection Agency - Administrative expenses</td>       <td>A.3</td>       <td>50,177</td>       <td>41,619</td>       <td>na </td>       <td>na </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Environmental and Climate Research</td>       <td>A.4</td>       <td>- </td>       <td>16,800</td>       <td>na </td>       <td>na </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carbon Fund</td>       <td>A.5</td>       <td>300</td>       <td>8,000</td>       <td>na </td>       <td>na </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>International Climate Change Commitments</td>       <td>A.6</td>       <td>15,000</td>       <td>15,000</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Climate Initatives</td>       <td>A.7</td>       <td>8,077</td>       <td>5,077</td>       <td>-   3,000</td>       <td>-37%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Just Transition Fund (IE &amp;amp; EU)</td>       <td>A.8</td>       <td>11,000</td>       <td>34,000</td>       <td>23,000</td>       <td>209%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SEAI Admin and General Expenses</td>       <td>B.3</td>       <td>18,383</td>       <td>21,475</td>       <td>3,092</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Residential/Community Retrofit Programmes</td>       <td>B.4</td>       <td></td>       <td>263,578</td>       <td>na </td>       <td>na</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other Energy Efficiency Programmes</td>       <td>B.5</td>       <td>283,276</td>       <td>46,065</td>       <td>na </td>       <td>na</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Energy Research Programmes</td>       <td>B.7</td>       <td>18,360</td>       <td>25,010</td>       <td>6,650</td>       <td>36%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waste Management Programmes</td>       <td>C.6</td>       <td>26,250</td>       <td>37,010</td>       <td>10,760</td>       <td>41%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td></td>       <td>430,823</td>       <td>513,634</td>       <td>82,811</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Quarterly reporting on the progress made for each of the actions and measures within the Climate Action Plan is undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach.

This includes ensuring the Scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the Scheme for homeowner &lsquo;revisits&rsquo; thereby allowing them apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme. </p><p>- A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households. This will help to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p><p>These new initiatives will be funded by the unprecedented National Development Plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030. Over 60%, or &euro;5 billion, of this funding will be sourced from carbon tax revenue. </p><p>Under the National Development Plan, the financial allocation for residential and community energy upgrade programme for 2023 will be &euro;291m.

Half-yearly or quarterly renewals involve additional costs to process and administer. Therefore, the rate for the half-yearly option is 55.5% of the annual rate, and, for the quarterly option, 28.25% of the annual rate. These ratios have remained generally consistent since the 1960s. The loss of income from equalising rates for these options would have a negative impact on motor tax revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or in the taxation system generally. The potential loss to the Exchequer has been estimated at just over &euro;37m, based on the volume of transactions in 2021. Given the sum involved, any proposed reform of the current structure is a matter for consideration in the context of Budget preparations.</p></reply>

This policy links increases to CPI inflation at 31 March in any year and with any subsequent increases payable from 1 July of that year. As CPI inflation was 0% up to March 2021, the adopted policy governing the Scheme&rsquo;s rules and regarding pension increases does not support an increase in 2021.</p>  <p>  I therefore decided not to consent to the proposed 2.5% increase in benefits as the relevant CPI inflation calculation for the period in question - the year ending March 2021 - was actually 0% and the pension scheme&rsquo;s policy is only for inflation linked increases. A letter issued to the Company advising them of this decision on 13 June 2022. </p>  <p>  I wish to further clarify, that in seeking consent, the port company linked the request to a reversal of the impacts of the pension levy. However, it is considered that any reversal of the implementation of the  pension levy is a separate issue and the method employed are matters for the trustees of the pension scheme to resolve. This was also communicated to Dublin Port Company. </p>  <p>  More broadly, as I acknowledged in Parliamentary Question Number 201 of 28 June 2022, there are increasing inflationary pressures generally as reflected in the Consumer Price Index over the last year and any future requests for consent will be considered as appropriate in light of these developments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.242.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300092#WRD00400"><p>The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate. The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  As such, decisions regarding a dedicated transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister of Justice and the Garda Commissioner. I am given to understand that the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are that effective local community policing can meet the policing needs of the public transport network and that the Garda authorities do not propose to establish a specialist or dedicated transport policing unit at this time.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and a significant number of actions have been taken. These include; </p>  <p>- On the 29th of July, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Transdev &amp;amp; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will carry out a joint awareness day (operation twintrack) to prevent anti-social behaviour on our services and to raise awareness of staying safe on public transport.</p>  <p>  - Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued. Reportable ASB incidents on Irish Rail have reduced from 654 in 2020 to 549 in 2021.</p>  <p>  - I&Eacute; Security Centre at Howth Junction - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have appointed a supervisory team who coordinates the security response in the Greater Dublin Area.  Additionally, there is the deployment of public facing Security Teams in identified Anti-social behaviour hot spots across the DART and Rail Network.</p>  <p>- There are now nine Rapid Response Hubs in operation across the I&Eacute; Intercity Network with the latest, Mullingar, having come into operation from 9th   May 2022 (The 9 locations: Mallow, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Portlaoise, Athlone, Kildare, Longford, Castlerea and Mullingar). These hubs are now fully operational with all onboard staff have dedicated phone numbers for each of the hub locations in the event they require assistance.  These hubs provide reassurance for both staff and customers.  The Kilkenny hub is due to come into operation in mid July 2022, which will complete the first phase of this initiative.  This means should on-board staff request assistance by calling ahead to the next Garda Rapid Response Hub, they will receive priority service to deal with any issue.  Since coming into operation, this level of response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had a very positive impact in reducing the potential for such passenger issues escalating.</p>  <p>  - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recruited a Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and a Crime Prevention &amp;amp; Antisocial Behaviour Officer to design out crime.</p>  <p>  - CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.</p>  <p>  - A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.</p>  <p>  - In respect of Dublin Services, Public Transport Hubs have been established for Heuston Plaza and Connolly Plaza.  A third one at Broombridge, Cabra, will come into operation shortly.  This is a Joint initiative between public transport providers Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann/Transdev (LUAS)/Dublin Bus/Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Engagement Units at Kevin Street, Store Street and Cabra. </p>  <p>  - Transdev/ LUAS employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.</p>  <p>  - In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.</p>  <p>  - Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  - Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.</p>  <p>  - Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.</p>  <p>  - All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.</p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.</p></reply>

The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, which recently completed committee stage in the D&aacute;il, creates a new category of vehicle in the Road Traffic Act, 1961 called powered personal transporters (PPTs), which will not need registration, licensing, taxation or a driving licence. The PPT category will include powered light micro-mobility vehicles such as e-scooters. The Bill has provisions to allow for regulation of the use of PPTs on public roads. </p>  <p>  Establishing this new category of vehicle enables, in secondary legislation, the establishment of appropriate technical and safety standards and rules for the use of e-scooters.

This report is available at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/lpt/lpt-vacant-properties-report.pdf. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the data in this report are not directly comparable to that reported by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in its Census findings, due to the differing bases for the data and the differing methodologies used to collect it. These differences are analysed in some detail in the report at pages 10 and 11 and I would refer the Deputy to this for more detail on this matter.</p><p>In summary, the Revenue data are derived from declarations made by taxpayers on the LPT returns, whereas the CSO data reflect the observations of Census enumerators. Revenue data is also limited to properties where a liable person was required to make an LPT return. Properties that were uninhabitable or unsuitable for use as a dwelling as at 1 November 2021 are not liable for LPT for 2022. Owners of these properties were not required to value their property for LPT purposes and they were not required to submit an LPT return. Therefore, information from the returns will not include properties that are not liable for LPT in 2022, such as derelict or otherwise uninhabitable properties.</p><p>Revenue data reflects property owners&rsquo; self-assessment of the status of their properties in the context of the 4-year LPT valuation period. Property owners may not have considered properties to be vacant for the purposes of the LPT declaration where they were temporarily unoccupied for reasons such as short-term renovation, hospitalisation, travel, overseas assignments, or properties between lettings.</p><p>The CSO uses different methodologies and definitions of vacancy when conducting the Census. It is also worth noting that the CSO data reflects a specific point in time, i.e. Census Night on 3 April 2022 and includes properties that were vacant for a short period of time that may well have been occupied again a few weeks after Census night.  It should be noted that this is a point in time measure of vacancy relating to the weeks either side of Census Night. The Census measure is not intended to be a measure of long term vacancy or that these properties are available for re-use. </p><p>Each model is valid for its primary purpose, and it is not unexpected that the figures from the Census and the LPT returns would differ. </p><p>Further information on the CSO measure of vacancy is available at <i>www.cso.ie/en/census/census2022/census2022andvacantdwellingsfaq/</i>.</p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays &ldquo;qualifying fees&rdquo; for an approved course whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual.</p><p>&ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &ldquo;student contribution&rdquo;. No other charges and levies qualify for tax relief e.g. administration fees, student centre levy, examination fees, capitation fees. Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.</p><p>The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per person, per course, per academic year. Each claim is subject to a single disregard amount each tax year. This amount is taken away from the total qualifying fees for the claim, such that relief can't be received on the disregarded portion. The disregard is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time student and &euro;1,500 for a part time student. If a claim has been made for more than one student or course, this disregard amount will only be deducted from the claim once.</p><p>Full details of the relief, including the conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/index.aspx</p><p>While there is no specific provision for tax relief in relation to the accommodation costs associated with attending third level education, the Rent-a-Room scheme supports the accommodation needs of third level students and others by providing significant levels of relief to accommodation providers offering rooms for rent within their sole or main residence. The relief is offered,<i>inter alia</i>, to providers of accommodation for full or part-time students, including lettings for an academic year, an academic term or four-day-a-week &quot;digs&quot;. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, proposals in respect of tax expenditures are dealt with in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. When considering such measures, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base. Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, tax measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></reply>

When the levy was first introduced, it was decided that the yield would be maintained at a fixed amount of approximately &euro;150m every year.  To arrive at this fixed amount, the charge is based on a percentage of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by certain financial institutions in a specified base year.  For the charge arising in the years 2021 and 2022, the levy is calculated using the base year of 2019 and a rate of 308%. </p><p>However, as Ulster Bank and KBC Bank are in the process of leaving the Irish market, both are excluded from the charge for 2022. This means that the charge will raise approximately &euro;87m in 2022, instead of &euro;150m. In the event the deposits associated with Ulster Bank&rsquo;s and KBC Bank&rsquo;s levy are transferred to another institution prior to the payment due date in October 2022, those deposits will not be subject to the levy either. </p><p>Details of the amount of the bank levy collected for the period 2014-2021 (and an estimate for 2022), as well as how the levy is calculated, are set out in tabular form below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year Bank Levy Due </th>       <th>Base year </th>       <th>Total DIRT in base year (&euro;m) </th>       <th>*Levy as % of DIRT </th>       <th>Actual yield (&euro;m) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014-2016 </td>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>&euro;435 </td>       <td>35% of DIRT </td>       <td>&euro;463 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017-2018 </td>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>&euro;300 </td>       <td>59% of DIRT </td>       <td>&euro;297 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019-2020 </td>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;118 </td>       <td>170% of DIRT </td>       <td>&euro;310 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;64 </td>       <td>308% of DIRT </td>       <td>&euro;150 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;64 </td>       <td>308% of DIRT </td>       <td>&euro;87 estimate </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Certain DIRT payments, such as those by Credit Unions, are not included when calculating the levy</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the exact annual yield from the bank levy is published on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/receipts/receipts-stamp-duty.aspx.</p></reply>

In April, the Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework, which sets the overarching response to the impacts of the war in Ukraine on the energy system in Ireland. The Framework outlines the structures which are in place within Government to monitor and manage our energy supplies, it sets out the plans which are in place to deal with energy security emergencies and it sets out how Government can support households and businesses save energy and save money.</p>  <p>  The Framework includes a commitment to work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the proposals set out in the EU&rsquo;s REPowerEU plan. Under REPowerEU, it is considered that taxation or regulatory measures aimed at removing gains created by the current crisis situation could be considered.</p>  <p>  The increasing cost of energy supply is complex and there are many factors which must be considered including energy security, rising input costs and costs to consumers, and the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be acknowledged. The Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy. All of these aspects must be considered in connection with proposed new policy measures.</p>  <p>  Energy policy is under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC). The Energy Security Energy Group, which is chaired by DECC and includes the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, is considering these issues in its role overseeing the implementation of the National Energy Security Framework.</p>  <p>  Officials in DECC are working to examine where gains created by the current crisis situation may be occurring and to consider what, if any, action would be appropriate having regard to over-arching energy policy. This includes engaging with Department of Finance officials to determine potential fiscal response measures. This ongoing work includes consideration of potential negative impacts of any such action. For example, there is a risk that a windfall tax may lead to higher consumer costs and negatively impact upon investment in the energy sector, particularly in the area of renewables. This would negatively impact the Government's ambitions to tackle climate change through the reduction of carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.</p>  <p>  With regard to the projected yield to the Exchequer of introducing a new windfall profits tax on energy providers. Trading profits of companies in Ireland are generally taxed at the standard Corporation Tax rate of 12.5%.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the gross additional yield from increasing the corporation tax rate from 12.5% to 25%, 27.5% or 50% on the taxable profits of all energy providers is tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;90 million, &euro;108 million and &euro;271 million respectively, for a full year. These estimates are based on the 2020 tax returns of energy providers, the latest year for which fully analysed data are available. On the same basis, a separate 25% levy on taxable profits, in addition to corporation tax, would yield in the region of &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that these estimates do not take account of any potential change in behaviour by the entities concerned in response to changes in the tax rate.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, Government set out an update to the budgetary strategy in this year's <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>.  For next year, the tax package has been increased to &euro;1.05 billion. This is a reflection of the need to adjust the fiscal parameters in light of the current inflationary environment.</p><p>While the specifics of tax policy measures to be introduced will be decided during the budgetary process, I have stated previously that a key objective of Budget 2023 will be to ensure that workers do not pay more income tax simply because they have moved into higher tax brackets as a result of inflation.</p><p>Finally, I would emphasise that this amendment to the budgetary strategy is a once-off change for 2023 only.  After next year, my Department expects inflation to moderate over the medium-term.

Therefore, 2019 was the earliest date that individuals were likely to exercise their options to acquire shares in qualifying companies. Revenue advises that the table below sets out the KEEP costs in 2019 and 2020: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Cost (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>0.2</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With the exception of the EII, the costs set out above can be assumed to be very broadly indicative of the annual saving that might arise if the schemes were ended. In the case of the EII, enhancements to the scheme made in Finance Act 2021 may give rise to an additional tax foregone cost of in the region of &euro;10 million in the current tax year.  Taking this factor into account, it is estimated that the abolition of the scheme beyond the current year could give rise to savings broadly of the order of &euro;25 million. </p><p>As matters stand, there is no sunset clause attached to the Rent-a-Room relief, but SARP and FED are due to expire on 31 December 2022.  The current sunset clause for EII extends to 31 December 2024.</p><p>As part of the preparations for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022, my Department has undertaken a review of KEEP. A public consultation took place as part of this review, inviting stakeholders to comment on the operation of the scheme as it currently stands and to submit proposals for further improvements to the scheme. The output from this review will be considered as part of the forthcoming the Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. This relief is known as Remote Working Relief. The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate.  </p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2022, it was estimated that this measure would cost approximately &euro;10 million in 2022 and &euro;11 million in 2023.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, employers may pay a tax-free amount of &euro;3.20 per day to employees who satisfy the qualifying conditions for the Remote Working Relief. Revenue has confirmed that as this payment is made tax free, it does not have details of the number of employees involved. Any amounts paid exceeding the &euro;3.20 daily rate are subject to tax, PRSI and USC in the normal manner. If employees claim Remote Working Relief, any payment by their employer for remote working expenses must be deducted from the claim.</p>  <p>  Real time claims for Remote Working Relief became available on the 24th January 2022. I am advised by Revenue that for the year to June 2022, 1,401 individuals have submitted claims in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in respect of Remote Working Relief. In monetary terms, relief of approximately &euro;45,000 has been granted. It should be noted, however, that this is unlikely to be the final figure for such claims, as taxpayers have up to four years to claim expenses. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.325.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300093#WRE02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 138 and 166 together.</p>  <p>  Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for the Cycle to Work scheme. This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee.</p>  <p>  The work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers. Accordingly, there are no records available on the number of people availing of the scheme, or the number who accessed the maximum amount of tax relief or the cost of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Tax expenditure reports prepared by my Department have estimated the cost in the full years 2017-2019 at &euro;4 million (based on an assumption of 20,000 beneficiaries) and notes that this figure is an estimate as separate returns are not required under the scheme. This estimate was increased to &euro;4.5 million in 2020 on foot of the changes made to the scheme by Section 9 of the Financial Provision (Covid-19)(No.2) Act 2020. This increased the allowable expenditure from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 in respect of e-bikes and &euro;1,250 in respect of bicycles and allowed the purchase of a new bicycle every 4 years instead of 5. The estimate was &euro;5.5 million for 2021 with the full year impact of the changes. With an assumption of 20,000 beneficiaries, this gives an average of &euro;275.</p>  <p>  The potential cost of a cycle to school scheme would depend on uptake and the marginal rate of tax being paid by the parent and the threshold value allowed under such a scheme. CSO data from Census 2016 shows that 7,326 children aged between 5 and 12 years, and 7,282 students at school or college aged between 13 and 18 years used bicycles as their means of transport. This could give a potential uptake of over 14,000 but each child would not get a new bicycle each year.</p>  <p>  Making certain assumptions in relation to cost and uptake on a similar basis as used for reporting on the cycle to work scheme in the tax expenditure reports, such a scheme is tentatively estimated to have a potential annual cost of approximately &euro;1 million. However, the technical and administrative details of how such a scheme would operate would also need to be considered and could impact significantly on cost.  </p>  <p>  I should add that including bicycles for use by children to cycle to school would add to the administrative burden on employers of participating in the scheme. Furthermore, I would expect considerable deadweight in such a proposal with people benefitting who would have purchased a bicycle in any event.</p>  <p>  If the threshold for the cycle to work scheme was reduced to &euro;500, the estimated cost of the scheme would be reduced on a straight line basis by &euro;3.5 million to &euro;2 million.

The report provides significant insights into the exchequer, distributional and income effects of an array of potential tax changes, all of which are important considerations for budgetary policy. Among these, a number of wealth taxes were considered.</p><p>While I understand the background to calls for a specific wealth tax in Ireland, it is not the case that wealth in Ireland is untaxed, as taxes on wealth are already in place here.</p><p>These wealth taxes include Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax and Local Property Tax, which between them, according to Revenue&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2021, raised some &euro;2.77 billion net. last year.</p><p>Any revenue raised from a new wealth tax may not therefore be additional to the existing forms of wealth taxation, as revenues from those taxes could be affected by the introduction of such a new tax. </p><p>As to the projected yield that might be derived from the wealth tax outlined by the Deputy in his question, I would note that in order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals. As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax.</p><p>During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website (), presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios).

In the first instance, the credit reduces the CT liability of the company for the accounting period in which the relevant R&amp;amp;D expenditure is incurred. Any excess credit can be carried back to the preceding accounting period. Following this, any remaining excess credit can be carried forward indefinitely for use against future CT liabilities, or can be claimed as a repayable credit.</p><p>The company may apply for a refundable credit in three instalments, over 33 months. The first instalment to be paid will amount to 33% of the excess amount. The remaining balance of the excess amount will then be carried forward and used to reduce the company&rsquo;s Corporation Tax liability of the next accounting period and then, if any of the excess amount still remains, a second instalment amounting to 50% of that remaining balance will become payable.  Any remaining credit is again carried forward for offset against the company&rsquo;s Corporation Tax liability of the following accounting period, and if any part of the excess R&amp;amp;D credit still remains, that amount will become payable not earlier than 24 months after the corporation tax pay and file date for the accounting period in which the R&amp;amp;D expenditure was incurred.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that It is not possible to estimate the yield from ending the repayable element of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, as information in respect of the future payments of the credit, which is dependent on the future profitability of claimant companies and on their level of qualifying R&amp;amp;D activity, is not known in advance. </p><p>Furthermore, as excess credit can be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future corporation tax liabilities, the elimination of the refundable element of the credit would in theory be largely a timing issue and not a net saving to the Exchequer.

Around the time of the proposal, Eurostat estimated the population of Ireland to be approximately 0.9% of the total population of the EU. </p><p>Applying this to the Commission&rsquo;s overall estimated yield would mean that Ireland could collect approximately &euro;45 million from introducing a Digital Services Tax of the type mentioned. </p><p>The net yield would be reduced to the extent that deductions from company profits for Digital Services Tax paid would reduce corporation tax receipts.</p><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposal was based on (1) a &euro;750 million global revenue threshold and (2) an EU-wide &euro;50 million revenue from in-scope services threshold. Based on available data, it is not possible to estimate the potential yield of a Digital Services Tax with different thresholds. </p><p>It should be noted that Pillar One of the two-pillared solution to address the tax challenges brought about by the digitalisation of the economy, agreed last October by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, provides for the standstill and removal of Unilateral Measures such as Digital Services Taxes.</p><p>I firmly believe that Pillar&rsquo;s One and Two of the agreement will be successfully implemented, in a manner which is faithful to the agreement. I am devoting considerable resources to this process. My officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners, are engaged in intensive discussions with their counterparts from around the world at OECD working parties to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected.</p><p>It should also be noted that in a joint statement published last October, the U.S. Treasury and its counterparts in Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom announced an agreement for the unwinding of Digital Services Taxes in return for the US dropping planned retaliatory trade sanctions on these countries.</p><p>It is important that any proposal avoids raising trade tensions and does not undermine the ongoing implementation of the OECD agreement. Implementation of the agreement will bring much needed stability to the international tax framework after the turbulence and uncertainty of the last couple of years. Throughout this process, I have remained convinced that a global approach under Pillar One of the OECD agreement is preferable to unilateral measures like a Digital Services Tax.</p></reply>

The relief was introduced in 2001 and abolished from 2011 onward.</p><p>A review of the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions and professional body fees was carried out by my Department in 2016 and included in the 2016 report on tax expenditures published on Budget day 2016.

Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join. There is no specific market failure that needs to be addressed by such a scheme, and it would consist largely of deadweight</i>.&quot;</p><p>In 2020, my Department carried out a further analysis which took stock of where matters stand in relation to the issue of tax relief for trade union subscriptions and set out a number of policy options for consideration.  This exercise suggested that, based on certain assumptions about numbers of beneficiaries, the measure could cost at least &euro;36.9 million if reintroduced at the same level of support as existed in 2010.  However, it also drew attention to the potentially significant dead weight element which would accompany the measure. That analysis was published with the 2020 Tax Strategy Group papers at the following link: <i>assets.gov.ie/86995/006fad3c-ebb5-4b0e-b067-92f8102d6e43.pdf</i>. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no current data available from tax returns on the number of taxpayers with trade union subscriptions and the costs of those trade union subscriptions. Therefore, there is no basis on which a cost can be estimated for the proposed measure.</p><p>However, the cost of the tax relief for trade union subscriptions in the seven years immediately prior to its end is published on Revenue's website.

This estimate assumes that there would be no impact on the level of multiple property purchases due to this proposed increase.</p><p>It is not possible to estimate the additional yield if the higher Stamp Duty rates were extended to apartments and properties rented to local authorities, as the specific data is not available from the information on stamp duty returns provided to Revenue.</p><p>I am advised that pages 18 and 19 of Revenue&rsquo;s Ready Reckoner can be used to estimate the yield from changes to the rate of Stamp Duty on property. The Ready Reckoner is available at the following link: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/ready-reckoner.pdf</i>. </p><p>The Ready Reckoner can also be used to estimate the additional yield from the proposed 1% increase in the rate of Stamp Duty on all non-residential property and on sales above &euro;500,000 only. The additional yield from a 1% increase in the rate on sales above &euro;1,000,000 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;58 million. </p><p>Finally, the Ready Reckoner can be used to extrapolate the estimated additional yield from increasing the commercial stamp duty rate to 15%. This estimated additional yield would be in the region of &euro;555 million. However, it should be noted that this estimate does not take account of behavioral changes that would arise from changing the rate significantly.</p></reply>

However, based on current deferrals, the annual cost of the reduction outlined by the Deputy is  estimated by Revenue to be in the region of &euro;0.1 million. </p>  <p>  The rate of interest was examined in the context of the LPT 2019 Review which recommended retaining the previous rate of 4%. The reduced rate of interest recognises that the circumstances in which a person defers the tax charge are very different from those where the property owner simply fails to pay the tax. A review of the interest rate also took place in 2021, in advance of the LPT revaluation. The review took account of the Covid initiative on the warehousing of tax debts, in respect of which a reduced interest rate of 3% applies for late payment of outstanding liabilities. In the interests of consistency and fairness, the Government decided to reduce the LPT deferral rate to 3% and this was provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021. The 3% rate applies to any LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022. </p></reply>

Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors, and further taxation is a matter for their country of residence. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Non-resident investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of IREF withholding tax if the relevant tax treaty allows for this. Irish resident investors are not subject to the IREF withholding tax as they are already subject to 41% exit tax on income/gains from funds.</p><p>A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a quoted company, used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property. The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are publicly listed companies - therefore distributions are dividends within the scope of Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT), which applies at a rate of 25%. REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of profits annually. Irish resident investors are liable to tax at their marginal rates on dividends received, with a credit for the DWT deducted. Non-Irish resident investors are subject to DWT at 25%. Those resident in treaty-partner countries may be able to reclaim some of this DWT under the relevant tax treaty.</p><p>The Deputy should note that, as outlined above, IREFs are not required to operate DWT in the same manner as REITs. The IREF withholding tax is charged at 20% and operates separately to DWT.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the yield from changes in the rates of withholding taxes on REITs and IREFs would be dependent on the level of future distributions by these entities. There is no basis available to provide an accurate estimate of these future distributions. Furthermore, as set out above, investors resident in treaty-partner countries may be able to reclaim some of the REIT DWT or IREF withholding tax deducted, by reference to an agreed distribution rate in the relevant bi-lateral treaty. In such cases, there would be no net Exchequer yield from an increase in the withholding tax rates as treaty relief would reduce the net tax back to the existing agreed rate. </p><p>However, the Deputy may be interested to note the information published on IREFs in the Revenue statistical report titled Corporation Tax &ndash; 2021 Payments and 2020 Returns which is available at the following link:<i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/ct-analysis-2022.pdf.</i></p><p>Table 18 in the report provides information in respect of IREFs based on returns filed with Revenue. Due to the low number of REITs operating in Ireland and Revenue&rsquo;s obligation to observe confidentiality, I am advised by Revenue that equivalent information in respect of REITs cannot be provided.</p></reply>

These serve different, defined purposes with some having been in place for a number of years. I should also state that there are no plans to discontinue them at this time. These are briefly detailed below.</p><p>The 2 per cent Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy is the only pure &quot;levy&quot; charged on insurance premiums. This is charged to fund the ICF, which covers the cost of claims in this State where an insurer goes into liquidation. This levy was in place from 1984 to 1992 and was reintroduced in January 2012. It currently applies at a rate of 2 per cent of premiums received on all non-life insurance policies and its purpose is primarily to repay the Exchequer for funding the administration of Quinn Insurance. As there is still a significant amount owing to the State, the levy is likely to be applied for most of the remainder of this decade.</p><p>Separately, while there is not a 1 per cent insurance levy, the Deputy may be referring to the stamp duty charged on life insurance premiums, which is occasionally described as a levy. However, this is recorded to the Exchequer as a tax receipt jointly with a separate 3 per cent stamp duty charged on certain non-life premiums. As such, it is not possible to differentiate both distinctly. Information on Stamp Duty yields, which includes these Life Assurance and Non-Life Insurance Levy components from 2010 onwards, can be found on the Revenue website statistics page: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/receipts/stamp-duty-receipts.pdf</i>. However, since 2010 the total amount collected under these specific stamp duties has totaled c.&euro;1.8 billion.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note the Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund (MIIC Fund) is a contribution equivalent to 2 per cent of gross motor premiums, which is provided by motor insurers. This is not considered a levy as the decision rests with the insurance companies as to how this is financed i.e. either through absorbing it or passing it onto consumers. This ensures the compensation levels payable from the ICF for third party motor insurance claims as a result of a motor insurer insolvency is now  aligned with that where a motorist is in a collision with an unidentified or uninsured driver.</p><p>The contribution rate is subject to an annual review by me in my role as Minister of Finance. Currently, it is expected to continue for a number of years.</p></reply>

This stability has enabled companies to plan long-term investments in Ireland, generating employment and increasing economic activity.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland signed up to the OECD Two Pillar agreement in October 2021, including the agreement of a global minimum effective rate of 15% for in-scope entities.  Before joining the OECD Two Pillar agreement in 2021, I ensured that Ireland would continue to be able to offer a 12.5% rate for businesses out of scope of the agreement, i.e. businesses with revenues less than &euro;750m. This means that over 95% of companies operating in Ireland are outside of the scope of the global minimum effective tax rate of 15% and they will continue to be taxed at the 12.5% rate.</p>  <p>  On a straightforward, mathematical basis there would be a large theoretical yield from increasing the 12.5% trading rate of corporation tax (with a smaller theoretical yield for the non-trading 25% rate). However, as has been demonstrated in research published by my Department and the ESRI, it is likely that such changes would lead to lower levels of economic activity, behavioural changes in the locational decisions of multinational companies and employment in the multinational sector. In turn, this would be expected to result in reductions in tax revenues across a number of tax heads.  Therefore, it is not possible to accurately or robustly estimate the potential yield from rate increases of this nature.</p>  <p>  With regard to effective rates of tax, analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance (co-authored by an independent academic), a separate report undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General and Revenue&rsquo;s annual analyses of corporation tax payments and returns, all using the most appropriate methodology, confirm that the overall effective rate of corporation tax paid by corporations in Ireland is between 10% and 11%. While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of a small number of targeted tax measures that may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As signatories to the OECD Two Pillar agreement, Ireland is now working towards the introduction of the 15% global minimum effective rate by end 2023.  While this will increase the tax rate for in-scope companies, it is important to recognise that this is only one element of the Two Pillar agreement.  Any projected changes to corporation tax yields following implementation must therefore also take into account Pillar One, which provides for a reallocation of certain profits to market jurisdictions.  Ireland signed up to the OECD Two Pillar agreement in October 2021 in the knowledge that there would be a net cost in terms of reduced tax revenues.  However, the agreement will have broader benefits in that implementation is expected to bring much needed stability to the international tax framework after the turbulence and uncertainty in recent years, allowing companies the certainty to plan investments and focus on core business activities.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s current estimate of the cost of joining this agreement is in the region of &euro;2 billion annually, albeit that it remains very difficult to accurately estimate the impact at this stage.</p>  <p>  The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly but I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century</p></reply>

Its internal employee resource group, the Bankability Network, is responsible for providing support to employees with disabilities, raising awareness among staff of disability issues and attracting prospective employees with disabilities to the Bank. The Bank engages with the Bankability Network on relevant matters to ensure colleagues with disabilities are provided with an opportunity to contribute on these issues. Within the past year, the Bankability network hosted various events promoting disability awareness and the network contributed to the Staff Diversity Newsletter. By promoting disability awareness and making every effort to provide an environment to do so, the Bank is creating an environment that employees will feel comfortable to disclose their disability in order for it to provide the support and/or accommodations they may require.  The Bank has a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group which provides an opportunity for members to inform and contribute to its overall Disability and Inclusion agenda, and has an internal Disability Taskforce in place that is responsible for coordinating and overseeing compliance with disability legislation. The Bank engages with external organisations to support the employment of persons with disabilities. It continues to engage with the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) on the facilitation of Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) work placements, ring-fencing roles on its graduate programmes for those who apply via WAM. The Bank participates in various events and workshops including AHEAD&rsquo;s annual careers event for students and graduates with disabilities.  </p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is committed to the priorities set out in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NDIS). The accessibility of its services for people with disabilities and the consideration of wider human rights and equality issues related to the FSPO&rsquo;s functions form a key commitment within its current 3-year Strategic Plan, &ldquo;Connecting and Innovating&rdquo;. In particular, in relation to Action 32 of the NDIS, the FSPO has committed to reviewing its key projects over the lifetime of the Strategic Plan through a human rights and equality lens which will involve disability-proofing its services and may include consultation, as appropriate. In 2021, the FSPO conducted an open public consultation process to inform the development of its Strategic Plan. </p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is fully committed to providing excellent service to all individuals. As part of that commitment, Revenue provides a network of trained Access Officers who are available to assist customers with disabilities. To ensure the quality of this service is maintained to the highest standards, Access Officers receive ongoing training in disability awareness and equality, guided by material published by the National Disability Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Revenue also works with Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS), the national sign language interpreting service for Ireland, to provide a free Irish sign language interpreting service to customers with hearing disabilities. Revenue is committed to achieving the compliance standards set out under the European Union (Accessibility of Website and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) -Regulations 2020. Revenue ensures that its website (<i>revenue.ie</i>) and its online services (ROS, myAccount, LPT Online) meet all of the Level AA Success Criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - <i>www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21</i>/.

Officials from my Department participate on this Working Group. </p><p>The objectives of the group are to identify the scope of relevant significant defects in housing, to evaluate the scale of housing affected, to propose a means of prioritising defects, to evaluate the cost of remediation, to recommend appropriate mechanisms for resolving defects and, to consider financing options in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>The final report of the Working Group is due shortly, and I will consider any recommendations that might envisage tax expenditures in the light of my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.

However, as Article 13a of the relevant EU legislation (2020/1151) is structured differently to what is already permitted for small beer producers (under Article 4), the existing relief in Irish legislation for beer cannot be simply extended to cider.  It will be necessary to provide a separate new relief, which would be similar in concept but different in detail. To this end, the Department of Finance and Revenue are engaging with industry and working to bring forward a new relief broadly modelled on the existing relief arrangements for beer but compatible with the amended EU legislation for the forthcoming Finance Bill.</p>  <p>  The scope of the relief will be subject to a Budget decision. As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

It also provides for the transposition of Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The Bill provides for enhanced protections, notably:</p>  <p>  - the extension of the existing protections of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to a wider cohort including volunteers, shareholders, persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, and persons going through a recruitment process or in pre-contractual negotiations,</p>  <p>  - reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts,</p>  <p>  - access to interim relief at the Circuit Court against penalisation, and </p>  <p>  - providing for criminal penalties for penalisation.</p>  <p>  Following a recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report and at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February of this year, I signalled my intent to consider how to make provision for retrospective protection where possible. At each stage when this Bill has been considered, I have updated members of the House on progress in this regard, and my commitment to go as far as possible to provide retrospective protection, where possible, to persons who have reported relevant wrongdoing within the meaning of the Act prior to the Bill's forthcoming enactment. In light of my instruction to provide retrospective protection as broadly as possible, the amendments required careful consideration by my officials in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The amendments introduced at Committee Stage in the Seanad fulfil the commitment I gave to the Houses on this matter.</p>  <p>  The amendments I have introduced provide that a worker who reports a relevant wrongdoing before the Bill is enacted but suffers penalisation after the Bill is enacted is entitled to the enhanced protections of the amended legislation, including the reversal of burden of proof in civil proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the courts.</p>  <p>  The amendments further provide that a worker (as defined in the 2014 Act) who reports a relevant wrongdoing and suffers penalisation before the Bill is enacted but has not initiated proceedings at the WRC or the courts will be entitled to the reversal of the burden of proof in such proceedings.  I am satisfied in light of my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Attorney General that it is not possible to apply those changes to existing proceedings, since that would involve interfering with already existing litigation.  To seek to apply new rules to cases where proceedings have already issued would be unfair and give rise to legal issues.  This is especially so where there is already a Court decision in place.</p></reply>

PAS set out last year to develop its first ever <b>Equality Monitoring Dashboard. </b>The ESRI, the data partners for this project, have analysed data relating to 4,500 recruitment campaigns, including candidate profile information, applications made, and appointments made. This work will support the development, across the wider civil and public services, of a robust set of ED&amp;amp;I metrics and will help identify emerging trends. </p><p>Recruitment and selection processes, policies and procedures need to be reviewed, assessed and improved where required to encourage and enable access to opportunity for candidates from diverse backgrounds. An ED&amp;amp;I diagnostic review of PAS&rsquo;s internal and external recruitment operations has taken place; the next steps will be to develop an action plan to deliver on the recommendations in the report. </p><p>PAS have also developed a school resource kit to bring careers in the civil and public sector to life for young people from all backgrounds, and in this resource kit PAS profile people from all backgrounds. </p><p>The position in relation to the remaining bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out below. </p><p><b>Office of Public Works (OPW)</b></p><p>The Office of Public works implements best practice procedures for recruitment and selection in accordance with Employment Equality laws, and acts as an equal opportunities employer.The Office does not collect statistical data about candidates or employees who are members of the LGBTQIA+ community and does not set recruitment targets for members of this community.</p><p>In accordance with its public sector duty under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014, the Office has regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and treatment for its staff.  The whole OPW workforce has been involved in affirming our commitment to upholding the values of FREDIE - Fairness, Respect, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement.Among its strategic HRM objectives, the Office will continue developing policies and practices that ensure equality and parity of esteem for all staff, equality of opportunity, inclusion, diversity and a strong sense of belonging where difference is celebrated in all aspects of working life.  </p><p><b>National Shared Services Office (NSSO)</b></p><p>The Public Appointments Service is responsible for recruiting staff to the NSSO and as such recruitment to the NSSO is arranged under the PAS Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy. </p><p><b>State Laboratory</b></p><p>The State Laboratory is an equal opportunity employer, and uses the Public Appointments Service and 3<sup>rd</sup>party recruitment agencies to undertake recruitment. Whilst positions have not been specifically ring fenced for LGBTQIA+ communities, the ethos as an equal opportunity employer prevails.</p><p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p><p>The recruitment of staff in the Office of the Ombudsman over the last number of years has predominantly been undertaken through competitions run by the Public Appointments Service with the exception of one competition which the Office ran directly for a number of specialist posts.  This Office is very aware of robust equality legislation being in place which includes the outlawing of sexual discrimination in the recruitment of staff and is also aware of the National LGBT+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-21.</p><p><b>Office of the National Lottery Regulator (ORNL)</b></p><p>The ORNL is a small office with Ministerial sanction for 11 staff, including two part-time staff.  The Office is fortunate in that it does not have a high turnover of staff and has not needed to fill any vacancies since January 2020.  Two vacancies have now arisen and the recruitment process to fill these vacancies is about to commence.  The Office is, and always has been, an equal opportunities employer and actively and prominently welcomes applications for all posts advertised from any applicant (regardless of their LGBTQIA+ status, disability status, etc.) that meets the requirements of the post being filled. The Office is an inclusive environment and celebrated Pride month in June.</p></reply>

As part of the total budget package set out for each year to 2025, amounts of between &euro;3 to 3.4 billion are indicated as for &lsquo;budgetary decisions&rsquo; in Table 1 of the document.  For 2023, this figure under &lsquo;budgetary decisions&rsquo; is &euro;3.0 billion. This category comprises provision for Existing Levels of Service (ELS) costs and the planned core capital expenditure increases under the National Development Plan (NDP).</p>  <p>  The NDP published in October 2021 provides a detailed and positive vision for Ireland over the next 10 years, and sees total public investment of &euro;165 billion over the period 2021-2030. Core capital increases in upcoming Budgets will be in line with the parameters set out in the NDP, with an additional &euro;0.8 billion in 2023.</p>  <p>  Under the approach set out in last year&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement, 3% of the core current expenditure base is being set aside each year to meet ELS costs. These include costs arising from demographic pressures in areas such as Social Protection, Health and Education; carryover costs from measures already introduced in prior year Budgets; and public service pay commitments under existing pay deals. &euro;2.2 billion is indicated under Budget 2023 to meet these costs.</p>  <p>  The division of the available resources under this 3% provision between the areas covered by ELS will be examined and allocated as part of the Estimates process each year, with the breakdown published in the Expenditure Report.</p></reply>

Following the Revised Estimates in December 2021, &euro;3.9 billion of this funding remained unallocated. This contingency is held in reserve centrally to allow Government flexibility to respond to emerging needs during the year. </p><p>In February 2022, the Government announced a suite of measures to assist with costs of living pressures. This included the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, which had an estimated cost of &euro;400 million. This required a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, given the scale of this amount in relation to the original Estimate for Vote 29. This Supplementary Estimate was brought before the D&aacute;il in March to provide an additional allocation of &euro;271 million with the remaining cost funded through reallocation of existing Vote 29 resources. Following this development, the remaining contingency balance stood at just under &euro;3.7 billion. </p><p>While this is the only draw down from the contingency funding allocated in Departmental Estimates in the first six months of 2022, there are significant pressures and commitments on the remaining funding including:</p><p>1. Further Covid support measures, including the response to the Omicron wave will require additional funding over that foreseen at the time of Budget 2022. This includes income and employment support schemes in the Department of Social Protection, Department of Health Covid-19 response, the targeted Commercial Rates Waiver for Q1 2022 and Department of Education Covid response measures.  These Covid-19 expenditure pressures are evident in the end June expenditure reported in the Fiscal Monitor with gross current expenditure in the Department of Social Protection &euro;292 million ahead of profile and &euro;284 million ahead of profile in the Department of Health.</p><p>2. Additional allocations may be required to fund the other cost of living measures announced in throughout the first six months of 2022. </p><p>3. Costs related to the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine will also need to be provided. Ultimate costs will depend on the numbers of refugees arriving, the length of stay, labour market participation over time and the accommodation solutions provided. There is considerable uncertainty in relation to these elements and it is too early to say how much will be required from the contingency at this point. To date approximately &euro;186 million has been spent across a number of Departments.</p><p>4. An additional Supplementary Estimate of &euro;110 million was presented to the D&aacute;il at the beginning of July for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to make funds available to address security of energy supply for winter 2023/24 as set out in the <i>EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022</i>.</p><p>Further allocations from the contingency will be considered later in the year taking account of any offsetting underspends.  </p><p>Regarding the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR), Budget 2022 announced around &euro;500 million of the overall BAR allocation will be made available as a first tranche of funding, with the remainder (c.&euro;0.6 billion) available in 2023. </p><p>Areas for funding identified under the BAR include: enterprise supports; measures to support fisheries and coastal communities; targeted supports for the agri-food sector; reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at ports and airports.</p><p>To allow Departments to proceed with programmes to be funded under the BAR, some &euro;54 million was allocated as initial funding in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022.

All government departments report Equality Budgeting indicators, with 26 metrics published in the latest Public Service Performance Budgeting Report published in May 2022. REV 2023 will continue this process. </p>  <p>  More generally, the Equality Budgeting agenda is being progressively developed:</p>  <p>  - An Expert Advisory Group was established to guide development of Equality Budgeting policy, and has met regularly since 2018. To further support the implementation of Equality Budgeting across all Departments, in March of this year, the Government agreed to the establishment of an Inter-departmental Group on Equality Budgeting.</p>  <p>  - In 2019, my Department commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. </p>  <p>  - In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equality data strategy, the CSO completed a data audit in cooperation with my Department, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. A report on this audit was published in October 2020. </p>  <p>  - The OECD Policy Scan also raised the issue of an Equality Budgeting Statement. In light of the recent developments in the area outlined above, my Department is reviewing the different approaches to Gender Budgeting statements published by other OECD countries. The timing of publication, and the level of detail, vary greatly across OECD countries. This work will be used to inform future developments in this area taking into account: the level of detail in relation to Equality Budgeting currently published including in the REV and Public Service Performance Report; analysis published as part of the Spending Review process. Existing tools such as the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model; and linkages with the development of the Well-being Framework. In particular, this work will need to reflect that the approach to date with Equality Budgeting has been to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process by setting out targets in the REV and reporting on performance versus targets in the Public Service Performance Report, with analyses such as Social Impact Assessments also supporting this whole-of-year approach.</p></reply>

In July 2021, the Government published an initial report, <i>First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland, </i>that set out an initial multi-dimensional well-being framework.  The overarching vision of the <i>Well-being Framework for Ireland</i>is &ldquo;enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future&rdquo;.  In June 2022, the Government published a second report, <i>Understanding Life in Ireland: The Well-being Framework</i>, that builds on the initial report by taking account of the contributions to a public consultation and further research.  Since autumn 2021, the CSO has hosted an interactive dashboard that flows from the conceptual framework and uses a cohesive set of indicators to measure life and progress in Ireland.</p><p>The Government is also committed to ensuring that the well-being framework is utilised in a systematic way across government policy making in evaluating programmes and reporting progress as well as in setting budgetary priorities (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).</p><p>As the budgetary process is a whole-of-year process, the well-being initiative is being developed in a way that seeks to inform this process as a whole.  </p><p>Already, the use of a well-being perspective has been evident at the National Economic Dialogue.  Over the course of the last couple of years, I have chaired breakout sessions that have been informed by a well-being perspective.  This has provided participants with an opportunity to consider longer-term economic, social and environmental factors as part of their discussions of budgetary prioritisation. </p><p>Departments have been invited to consider how they might utilise the Well-being Framework as part of the Spending Review process.  This is part of a wider effort to progress the use of the Well-being Framework as part of the policy process.  </p><p>Finally, as noted in the <i>Expenditure Report 2022, </i>and subsequently in <i>Understanding Life in Ireland: The Well-being Framework, </i>the next phase of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform's work in this area is to develop an approach to associating public expenditure with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework.  The intention is to develop over time a way of setting out budgetary decisions on the basis of well-being dimensions; an approach that would complement the existing Vote Group approach to presenting such decisions.</p></reply>

Action 32 of the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 required that service providers actively engage with disabled people and their representatives in the planning, design, delivery and evaluation of public services.  In 2019, to further engage in monitoring of the effectiveness of legislation around building access, under Section 25 of the Disability Act 2005, OPW and the NDA published <i>An Operational Review of the Effectiveness of Section 25 of the Disability Act 2005 </i>following focused user-group /stakeholder engagement. In this instance the OPW collaborated closely with the National Disability Authority. At present, and mainly as a result of Covid 19, the OPW does not have any such consultative committees in train.</p><p>In most instances, all new works are required to apply for a Disability Access Certificate (DAC). Historical buildings, protected structures and heritage visitor sites have some dispensations, depending on the impact of alterations on the historic fabric, attendant grounds, planning restrictions, archaearchaeology or the setting or all of the above. Often in these situations, modern facilities are provided in separate purpose-built temporary or permanent accommodation. This is usually subject to a suite of statutory obligations and to consents if it relates to a national monument. In any case, the Office of Public Works strives to comply with Disability Access Certificate (DAC) requirements in both modern and historical buildings within the State&rsquo;s portfolio. With regard to modern buildings, built before the advent of DAC's, OPW have a policy and ongoing programme to update those buildings to modern compliance standards, as a high priority, for which there is a dedicated Universal Access Budget. </p><p>All new or significant upgrades to existing OPW owned or leased civil service office accommodation, completed since the advent of DACs, would have gone through a regulatory DAC process or equivalent. This means that the staff and visitors to these buildings have access to universal access facilities in compliance with the Technical Guidance Documents of the Building Regulations 1997-2010. </p><p>Due to the nature of its role, my Department and the Office of Government Procurement, which is also part of my Department, currently have no office locations that provide such facilities to the general public.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) also does not have public offices open to the public for this purpose but the Office manages a number of buildings and heritage sites around the country to which the public has access.  Most of these are open, albeit subject to public health restrictions, and further information can be found on the OPW website.</p><p>With the exception of the Office of the Ombudsman, all other bodies under the aegis of my Department would not, under normal circumstances, be open to the public to access these facilities.  I have been advised that the office of the Office of the Ombudsman has fully accessible changing places and toilet facilities which are open to the public.</p></reply>

As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have policy responsibility for recruitment to the civil service. As reflected in the <i>Civil Service Renewal 2024 Strategy</i>, the civil service is strong committed to equality of opportunity for all in terms of its recruitment and employment practices and building a more diverse and inclusive workforce that is reflective of the modern Ireland that it serves.</p><p>My Department also works closely with the National Disability Authority, as well as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and with the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth to further embed Equality Budgeting in the performance budgeting and policy making process to help ensure that resource allocation decisions are appropriately targeted. This is done through the work of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group and the Interdepartmental Group on Equality Budgeting established to further guide the ongoing rollout of Equality Budgeting. </p><p>DPER published the Public Service Performance Report in May 2022, which includes a section on Equality Budgeting. 26 metrics have been published and all the Departments reported on equality budgeting. Of these, four elaborated and provided data for disability metrics. An ongoing project with the OECD is developing a system for future tagging of equality budgeting to assist in further embedding the initiative and increasing coverage to support better policy outcomes.</p><p>In addition, my Department recently reported to the National Inclusion Strategy Stakeholder Group on the progress we made in these initiatives as part of the implementation of the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities. </p><p>OneLearning, the Civil Service Learning and Development Shared Service Centre based within my Department, provides staff with the opportunity to undertake a self-guided eLearning module developed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) on Equality and Human Rights in the Public Service. This eLearning module has been developed to support and enable staff to understand and meet their obligations under the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty (Public Sector Duty) within public bodies and to support our goal to develop more diverse and inclusive workplaces.</p><p>PAS, which is a body under the aegis of my Department, is the primary recruiter for the civil service and other parts of the public service. PAS plays a central role in attracting a diverse range of talented people from all backgrounds to take up employment opportunities in the civil service. PAS launched its first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2021-2023 following extensive and ongoing engagements with NGOs.</p><p>In partnership with AHEAD, the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme offers graduates with a disability a 6 month mentored paid work placement in either the private sector or Civil Service.  My Department and PAS play a key role in driving the annual intakes of work placements across the Civil Service.  To date, WAM has placed over 550 graduates, of which 44% (241) have been placements across 39 Departments / Offices.  Over 80% of WAM graduates have subsequently secured longer-term employment upon completion of their WAM programme. </p><p>In terms of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion within my own Department, the HR Unit developed a HR Strategy that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training.  This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-Divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum, the PERspectives Group.  My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability.  New hires receive the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority.</p></reply>

In the case of medical card holders, a grant of up to &euro;6,350, or up to 80% of the approved cost, may be payable in respect of houses situated on the mainland, rising to &euro;8,252 where the house is situated on a specified off-shore island.  </p>  <p>  There is no requirement for the house to be the primary dwelling of the owner, however, the owner must consent to the proposed works and the house must be occupied as a full time place of residence on completion of the approved works i.e. not occupied as a holiday home. A total of 95 thatching grants were processed in 2021 with associated funding of &euro;435,038.</p>  <p>  Separately, Minister Malcolm Noonan, launched A Living Tradition, the new vernacular architectural heritage strategy, in December 2021. Action 6 of the strategy sets out to &lsquo;enhance the protection and conservation of historic thatched roofs&rsquo;. Officials in my Department have established a specific steering group, the Built Vernacular Heritage (Thatch) Steering Group to oversee and assist with the implementation of this particular part of the strategy. Under Action 6, the Steering Group will examine all issues relevant to thatched buildings, including thatching standards, fire prevention guidance, and the availability of suitable thatching materials, and any other relevant matters. The action also seeks to accelerate the recording and protection of these buildings, and to establish a central database. At present my Department estimates that there are 2,000 older vernacular thatched houses, and the establishment of a central database will provide further clarity on this figure. </p>  <p>My Department, in conjunction with the Steering Group, will also progress relevant parts of other actions of the strategy as they relate to thatch, including a review of grant assistance for such buildings.  </p></reply>

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard (includes concrete blocks, aggregates for concrete, hardcore etc.), is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.</p><p>SRs outline the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, manufacture of concrete blocks and require third party oversight of the manufacturing process by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks). A full list of designated Notified Bodies for construction products may be found on the New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System hosted by the European Commission.</p><p>Following the Government decision on the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme on 30 November 2011, NSAI was tasked with delivering the programme of work which includes a technical review by NSAI Masonry Committee of the Irish Standard for Concrete Blocks (including aggregates). This review by NSAI will adopt an evidence-based approach to enable technical advancement of the SRs. To this end, since 2021, I have commissioned further research to support NSAI in their task and gain a greater understanding of the effects of deleterious materials in aggregates and concrete blocks in order to avoid future adverse effects in buildings.</p><p>NSAI does not operate under the auspices of my Department, it is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, and as such detail issues in relation to committees, expertise, timelines etc., are matters for the NSAI.</p><p>Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant SRs published by NSAI.</p><p>My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the marketing and use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; on its website.  This Guide provides guidance to economic operators (manufacturers, importers and distributors) on the marketing of aggregate concrete blocks to EN 771-3 standard, the harmonised European standard under the Construction Products Regulation. It also outlines the responsibilities of specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users for compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021.  This Guide was disseminated to all building control authorities, NBCMSO and industry stakeholders and interested parties.</p><p>While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011. Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas.</p><p>In 2019, my Department issued <i>&lsquo;Guidelines for local authorities in the preparation of their Corporate Plans 2019-2024&rsquo;.</i>The corporate plan serves as the local authority&rsquo;s strategic framework for action over the duration of the plan. These guidelines emphasise the importance of the Building Control function to ensure safe and sustainable buildings in urban and rural areas and highlights the key responsibilities for Building Control, including monitoring compliance with Building Regulations, Building Control Regulations, Construction Products Regulation and Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) is managed by the National Building Control Office &amp;amp; Market Surveillance Office (NBCMSO) within Dublin City Council to provide oversight, support and direction for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities, through the five pillars of Training, Inspections, Compliance Support, Information System - BCMS and Market Surveillance.</p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) is delivered through a three-tier management structure which includes:</p><p>- The National Building Control Advisory Board, which advises on the strategic direction and guidance of the NBCMP.</p><p>- The NBCMSO, which implements the NBCMP and manages the working groups under each of the five pillars.</p><p>- Three Regional Building Control Committees (Eastern &amp;amp; Midlands, Northern &amp;amp; Western, and Southern), which provide a network for building control officers to exchange views and share good practice, leading to a uniform high level of enforcement in the discharge of the building control function. The Committees also contribute to and participate in the working groups established under each of the five pillars.</p><p>Officials from my Department participate throughout this structure at Board level, working group level and committee level.</p><p>In 2020, in order to strengthen the market surveillance function, I appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority, under the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020, for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis.</p><p>NBCMSO has been established for this purpose and may be contacted  at: support@nbco.gov.ie.  Building control authorities liaise with NBCMSO to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p><p>In 2020, my Department provided a budget allocation of &euro;500,000 to support the development of the Market Surveillance Office.  &euro;147,000 of the budget was expended as the project was at the early development set up phase.  In 2021, my Department provided &euro;564,000 to continue to support the development, and resourcing of the Market Surveillance Office which included a budget allocation of &euro;100,000 to Geological Survey Ireland to support NBCMSO with specific geotechnical expertise in the extractive and manufacturing sectors to further support more effective enforcement nationwide of construction products legislation.  Funding of &euro;564,000 is being provided by local authorities to the NBCMSO in 2022.  In addition, my Department is providing &euro;100,000 to Geological Survey Ireland to continue the work funded in 2021.</p><p>Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by NBCMSO, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to focus on the extractive industries sector and expand upon the programme commenced in 2021.</p><p>In October of last year I requested a Market Surveillance Audit of all quarries in Donegal which was carried out by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office in partnership with Donegal County Council and Geological Survey Ireland. I received a report of this audit at the end of June 2022 and I am currently examining its contents.</p><p>Finally, building control authorities and NBCMSO are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.</p></reply>

This practice, along with being unlawful under the Wildlife Acts, has also been linked to other criminal activity. Staff in my Department along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have carried out a number of joint operations in order to combat this practice and we have had six successful cases for illegal hare coursing in recent years. I would also like to confirm that NPWS enforcement staff  monitor social media in order to build up intelligence as, often, the social media clips in themselves are not sufficient to sustain a prosecution through the courts.</p>  <p>  In relation to enforcement generally, NPWS staff are working across all regions of the country to address wildlife crime and enforcement. These include Conservation Rangers and District Conservation Officers, supported by Regional Managers and Divisional Managers. There are in excess of 80 Conservation Rangers stationed right across the country at present, and I am committed to further increasing ranger numbers up to 120. This will greatly assist us in combatting this and other types of Wildlife Crime. </p></reply>

These include a commitment to examine defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report <i>&quot;Safe as Houses?&quot; </i>and to assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance. <i>Housing for All</i>, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments.</p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings have taken place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.

Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:<br /><br />-Identification and description of defect,<br /><br />-Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,<br /><br />-Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,<br /><br />-Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,<br /><br />-Period of construction affected,<br /><br />-Type of dwelling affected,<br /><br />-Location of dwellings affected.<br /><br />3.  Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.<br /><br />4.  Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.<br /><br />-In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.<br /><br />5.  Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:<br /><br />-Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,<br /><br />-Efficient means of carrying out work,<br /><br />-individual dwellings or whole building approach,<br /><br />-routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,<br /><br />-Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.<br /><br />6.  Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.<br /><br />7.  Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.<br /><br />8.  Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing. </blockquote>  <p>The working group is currently concluding its deliberations in support of the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and working towards finalisation of its report.

The Scheme uses regional price ceilings based on the median prices of new build first time buyer homes. This is to temper any inflationary pressures and to target support at the lower part of the price distribution in each area.</p>  <p>  The setting of the initial First Home Scheme price ceilings has been informed primarily by an analysis of the most recent published CSO data, specifically the national Residential Property Price Index (RPPI), together with a review of current market data and sales prices for new homes by first-time buyers. The price ceilings for the First Home Scheme are available on the dedicated website www.firsthomescheme.ie.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme Designated Activity Company holds responsibility for maintaining and any review or updating of price ceilings nationally. First Home has confirmed a review of ceilings will be undertaken after 6 months of operation of the scheme and periodically thereafter. This is to ensure any ceilings allow the scheme to deliver on its underlying objectives.</p></reply>

Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. The programme has been devised in a way to give local authorities a level of flexibility when selecting properties to retrofit ranging from those requiring minor levels of works to properties needing the maximum level of retrofitting required to bring them to a B2/Cost Optimum standard. </p>  <p>  Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department.

It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p>  <p>  Having a centralised passport system allows us to maintain the integrity of this vitally important document. It ensures that applications are processed by highly skilled staff who are expertly trained. The Irish passport ranks fifth in the world in terms of its security. It is critical that this high standard is maintained. </p>  <p>  Passport Service figures show a very small number of applicants, less than 1%, use the in-person Urgent Appointment Service available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork for those renewing their passport. This is mainly due to the efficiencies of the online system through which over 40% of adults using the service to renew their passport received it within 2 days.</p>  <p>  In terms of any proposed additional passport office, there are considerable financial implications to consider.</p>  <p>  The number of new passport applications is now, in fact, decreasing.

All applicants should check whether or not a civil letter of freedom is required. Please note if both partners are Irish citizens, they will both need to fill out separate applications.</p><p>Applicants need to submit an online application and pay the relevant fee, print the completed form (MP1) along with the relevant declaration form (MP2A if single), and have this witnessed by a solicitor/a commissioner for oaths/a notary public.  These will then need to be posted to the address provided, along with the original birth certificate and copy of passport.  If an applicant or their fianc&eacute; have ever been divorced the original petition and divorce decree must also be submitted.  </p><p>An application should be submitted at least four months in advance of the date of the marriage but no more than six months in advance of the date of marriage. If an application is received within 28 days of the intended date of marriage, a late application fee will apply.  We do our best to facilitate applicants but do request that applications are sent in four months in advance of the date of marriage. </p><p>The Marriages Abroad team in my Department will be glad to discuss the above with the person referred to, who I understand has not yet submitted an application.

The report includes statistical information on programme expenditure in a series of annexes. These show the distribution of aid, including the amounts allocated to our priority focus areas as set out in A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy. </p>  <p>  In 2019, a total of &euro;870 million was allocated to ODA, of which &euro;512 million was bilateral ODA. Health spending in 2019 amounted to 8% of bilateral ODA. Across all areas of ODA, including multilateral assistance, health related spending accounted for approximately 10% of the total for 2019 (approximately &euro;87 million). </p>  <p>  In 2020, a total of &euro;868 million was allocated to ODA, of which &euro;458 million was bilateral ODA. Health spending in 2020 amounted to 14% of the bilateral ODA. Across all areas of ODA, including multilateral assistance, health related spending accounted for approximately 13% for the year (approximately &euro;113 million), reflecting an increased emphasis on the sector in response to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The 2021 ODA spend is in the process of being verified by the OECD and the full breakdown will be published later this year in Ireland's Development Assistance Annual Report for 2021. However, we expect health related expenditure to be at least &euro;100 million in 2021, based on internal estimates. </p></reply>

All of our recruitment competitions are run in accordance with the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) Code of Conduct 2022. The Code requires recruitment competitions to be administered in a fair and equitable manner. Opportunities advertised by PAS, or by my Department, include language clarifying that the Civil Service is an equal opportunity employer that welcomes applicants from diverse backgrounds. All interview boards are trained not to discriminate on any of the nine grounds of the Equality Acts and are also given training on unconscious bias.</p><p>My Department recognises the importance of creating a diverse and inclusive organisation.  The Human Resources Division leads on work to further embed a culture of dignity and respect in the Department, emphasising gender, equality, diversity and inclusion.  In 2019, under my Department&rsquo;s first HR Strategy 2019-2022, a dedicated Equality Officer was appointed to oversee work in this area, and policies have been developed that specifically support inclusion of LGBTQIA+ colleagues, notably A Guide to Supports for Maternity, Adoptive and Parental Leave, and A Guide to Supporting Transgender Colleagues.  </p><p>On 5 July 2022, my Department launched a Gender, Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Action Plan 2022-2025 that includes 39 actions and ambitious time-bound targets which include recruitment initiatives to increase diversity and the development of guidance for DFA staff on LGBTQIA+ issues for staff relocating overseas on postings.  A key partner in this work by Human Resources is the Management Board Sub-Committee on Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (GEDI), which includes a staff-led voluntary working group focusing on LGBTQIA+ issues. </p></reply>

My Department is also guided by the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service.

Service users can also use this platform to provide feedback/complaints to the Disability Liaison Officer on any aspect of the delivery of our services. When communicating with the public, my Department follows the recommendations of the National Adult Literacy Agency in using plain language. The Passport Office was previously the recipient of a NALA award for the use of plain English. My Department has also ensured that a number of staff working in the Passport Office are trained in Irish Sign Language to meet our obligations under the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.</p><p>  My Department also attaches the highest priority to ensuring the Department&rsquo;s buildings at home and abroad are accessible to people with disabilities.  One of the actions in my Department's new Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy will involve a comprehensive review of the accessibility of our buildings in HQ and the accessibility of our websites and online services.</p><p>  As part of our commitment to increase disability awareness amongst staff as set out in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, my Department has made available a comprehensive online Disability Awareness Training programme for all staff. This training complements training provided to staff engaged in the delivery of services to members of the public and was facilitated by an external consultant with extensive experience in area of disability awareness and training. On successful completion of the course, officers receive a Certificate of Completion which is valid for two years under the Disability Act 2005.</p><p>The Department will continue its efforts to improve the delivery of its services to all members of the public into the future, consulting with relevant stakeholders throughout.  </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p><p>Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time (apply on time and confirm they require a school bus ticket on time) are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p><p>Children who are not eligible but who apply for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats and are subject to certain conditions. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p><p>The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p><p>Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021/22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.</p><p>Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months; including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments. </p><p>A number of meetings have been convened in recent weeks with both the Technical Working Group and the Steering Group with a view to finalising the second phase of the review.  </p><p>Decisions in regard to measures for the 2022/23 school year will be made shortly and it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible. </p><p><b></b>The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.  </p></reply>

There are limited exceptions where the department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a specific and urgent need, for example Leaving Certificate Japanese and Italian.  </p>  <p>  Curriculum specifications and prescribed syllabus material are determined by the NCCA and it is the responsibility of each individual school to select the resources, if any, that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum.</p>  <p>  The NCCA meets with the educational publishers collectively, to regularly update them on curriculum developments and apprise them of the timelines for the development of new specifications. The NCCA does not advise upon the content of specific text books. Nor does the NCCA review or provide feedback on textbooks or have any role in endorsing or approving textbooks &ndash; this would be considered as interfering with the commercial marketplace </p>  <p>  The Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including Book Rental Schemes. Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.1 million in 2020 to all of these schools. School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes this Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Some 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools currently operate a book rental scheme.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the board of management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school. However, they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need. </p>  <p>  The Department published Circular 0032/2017 &ndash; &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; - in April 2017 which asks schools to provide a book rental scheme as well as to consult with parents on their views and suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.</p>  <p>  Members of the Irish Educational Publishers&rsquo; Association (IEPA) subscribe to a Code of Practice which includes an agreement that publishers will not revise any texts within at least four years - unless there is a change in the curriculum, the state examination or methods of assessment, or if there is a recognised teacher-led demand to do so.  </p></reply>

In the context of those students seeking to study in the UK, I note that, following the announcement of the publication date for the Leaving Certificate results by the State Examinations Committee, the CAO have now confirmed the date for the first round offers as 8th September 2022.  Within the UCAS system, the current date for the acceptance of final offers is 7th September, on which date the UK Higher Education Institutions start working through clearances (similar to the rounds system in the CAO).  Therefore there is no issue in terms of Irish students meeting the UCAS deadline.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also written to all EU Ministers for Education and have advised them of the date for issue of the Leaving Certificate results this year.  I have also requested that they give consideration to Irish students who may not have their Leaving Certificate results in time to complete the processing of their admissions at the usual time in the systems of each EU country.  For this reason, engagement with EUNICAS has not been necessary.  It is important to note that officials in my Department, working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will assist Irish students with issues they may be having with individual EU universities in this regard.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools and supporting small schools and I am delighted that significant progress has been made.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I ensured major investment in our primary and post primary schools and brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This was my second successive Budget which saw an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools. This significantly increased investment reflects my commitment and that of Government to support the educational success of learners and to provide a quality inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for all.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021, at primary level, saw the annual staffing schedule which determines the allocation of teachers to schools reduced to an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has delivered a further 1 point reduction for the 2022/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September. </p>  <p>  Prior to 2016, teachers were allocated to primary schools at a general average of 1 teacher for every 28 pupils. Budget 2016 improved this ratio by 1 point, to 27:1 and Budget 2018 further improved this ratio by 1 point, to 26:1</p>  <p>  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools giving a class size of 19:1 in junior schools, 21:1 in vertical schools (schools with junior and senior classes) and 23:1 in senior schools. The DEIS programme serves over 180,000 students annually and this will increase to 240,000 from September.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, teachers are currently allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the free education system and 23:1 to schools in the fee charging sector. </p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.7:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level and 13.6 to 12.4 at post-primary level when comparing the 2010/11 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  There are over 12,000 more teachers employed in our schools during the same period.</p>  <p>  Each one point improvement in the staffing schedule at primary level would cost in the region of &euro;15.5 million per annum and each one point adjustment to the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level would cost approximately &euro;58m per annum. </p>  <p>  My Department has in place detailed design guidelines for primary and post-primary schools which are available on my Department's web-site.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to extract the specific historic costs of additional accommodation associated with a reduction in the pupil teacher ratio.  Given the more flexible use of school accommodation at post primary level, it is expected that some level of additional staffing could be facilitated within most schools&rsquo; existing accommodation.  However, specific circumstances at each school including subject choices, timetabling and enrolment numbers by year group will be relevant in the assessment of any additional accommodation requirements.</p>  <p>  The actual cost of constructing a classroom for primary or post primary school can vary depending on a number of factors which can include, but not limited to the size and scope of the construction contract the classrooms are being constructed under, market conditions, site constraints, planning conditions, procurement method, etc. The Department's published Basic Building Costs limits apply. Based on this rate, it is expected that the construction cost of a typical primary school classroom would be in the region &euro;233,000.00 and &euro;179,000.00 for a post primary classroom.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  In 2021, receipts from school transport charges which includes eligible and concessionary tickets amounted to approximately &euro;12m (net of refunds issued arising from Covid related school closures).  The total amount of receipts without refunds, would be approximately &euro;16m.</p>  <p>  As part of the cost of living measures announcement by Government on 10 February 2022 for policy measures to mitigate the cost of living, for the 2022/2023 school year the annual school transport cap per family was set to be reduced from the previous cap of &euro;220 to &euro;150 per family at primary level and from the previous cap of &euro;650 to &euro;500 per family at post-primary level.  There were no reductions announced for single annual tickets at this time. Eligible children holding valid medical cards and eligible children with special educational needs were exempt from paying the annual charge.</p>  <p>  However, as you are aware, in recognition that this is an expensive time of year for families, within the last week I have put in place measures worth over &euro;17m which will ensure free school transport for families availing of the school transport scheme in the 2022/2023 school year, this includes students who travel on a concessionary basis.  These measures will provide families with savings of up to &euro;500 on the cost of tickets.  This figure is based on current patterns of school transport uptake and could vary depending on eligibility and demand.</p>  <p>  School Transport is a demand led scheme and services are planned annually based on the number of eligible pupils who apply and pay on time. The closing date for receipt of payment for school transport for the 2022/23 school year was set for the 29th July 2022.</p>  <p>Families who have already paid/entered medical card details for their ticket do not need to take any further action. Families who have not yet paid for their ticket will need to confirm they still require a ticket by the 29th July 2022 in line with the process.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have informed the Department the estimated total amount of payments received for the 2022/2023 school year was &euro;4m. Bus &Eacute;ireann will process a full refund to families who have already made payments for the new school year.  </p>  <p>  The final number of children to be accommodated on school transport services for the 2022/23 school year will not be known until after the closing date for confirmation has passed. </p></reply>

This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. </p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021/22 school year and will also continue for the 2022/23 school year. </p></reply>

To facilitate a September 2023 transfer, decisions would need to be made prior to the end of 2022 to allow for the various steps to be completed.</p><p>The learnings from the process in the pilot areas should provide a pathway forward on the process for providing multi-denominational options for parents in other towns and areas of the country going forward.</p><p>Most primary school property is in private ownership (often the Diocesan trust), with the local Bishop as patron. Where transfers of patronage take place and the school property owner is not the Minister for Education, lease arrangements between the property owner and new multi-denominational patron will be required and this will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware I recently announced initiatives to assist families with back to school costs. In recognition that this is an expensive time of year for families, I have put in place measures worth over &euro;17m which will ensure free school transport for families availing of the school transport scheme in the 2022/2023 school year.  This measure will provide families with savings of up to &euro;500 on the cost of tickets. </p>  <p>Families who have already paid/entered medical card details for their ticket do not need to take any further action. Families who have not yet paid for their ticket will need to confirm they still require a ticket by the 29th   July 2022 and further information will issue to families shortly in this regard. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time and who proceed to confirm to Bus &Eacute;ireann that they require a ticket by the 29th July 2022 will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2022/23 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for application for the 2022/23 school year was Friday 29th April 2022.</p>  <p>  Late applicants are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. </p>  <p>  School Transport is a demand led scheme and services are planned annually based on the number of eligible pupils who apply and pay/confirm on time. The closing date for families to confirm they require a ticket for school transport for the 2022/23 school year is 29th July 2022.  The final number of children to be accommodated on school transport services for the 2022/23 school year will not be known until after this date.</p></reply>

The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits and payments were calculated based on the Yearly Averaging approach.  PRSI Class S contributions (self-employed) were not reckonable for the State Pension (Transition).</p><p>It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to and more arduous than those applicable to the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) nor the Living Alone Allowance.  Furthermore, the State Pension (Transition) scheme had a retirement condition whereas the State Pension (Contributory) did not.</p><p>Since the State Pension (Transition) scheme ceased with effect from 1 January 2014, very significant amendments have been made to the State Pension (Contributory) scheme, which include the introduction of the interim Total Contributions Approach and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  Due to these changes, applicants for the State Pension (Contributory) are assessed under the Yearly Averaging system and the interim Total Contributions Approach and awarded on the basis of the most beneficial calculation. </p><p>While it would be possible to estimate the potential cost of reintroducing the State Pension (Transition) on the exact same legislative basis as it previously existed (which included specific rate-band structures and a yearly average method of payment calculation), it would not be possible to reintroduce it on that basis because of the changes outlined above.  Therefore, introducing such a scheme would require significant design changes to the previous State Pension (Transition) to modernise it in line with the Total Contributions Approach method of payment calculation and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As no such design work has been done, it is not possible to estimate the cost as requested. </p><p>In February 2021, I introduced the &quot;Benefit Payment for 65 year Olds&quot; in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who choose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not qualify for the State Pension until age 66.</p><p>The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7<sup>th</sup>October 2021 and it contained almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, agendas, minutes, external presentations and submissions in response to an extensive public consultation process are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.The Commission&rsquo;s work established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  It has set out a wide range of recommendations, including in respect of the State Pension Age and early access, and aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age. </p><p>In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of these deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration when that work is completed.</p><p>It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and complex.  It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In 2021, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 38.6% to 11.6%.  This represents a 70% reduction on the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  Ireland is consistently one of the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers. </p>  <p>  It is through this evidence-based approach that, over the past 10 years, budget measures have both exceeded inflation in that period and have also been targeted to support those most at risk of poverty.  This is evident in the recent results of the Survey on Income and Living Conditions which showed welcome reductions in the number of people at risk of poverty or deprivation. </p>  <p>  Having said that, the Government is acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households who are dependent on social welfare.  For this reason, this Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  </p>  <p>  Last week I, along with my government colleagues, announced further measures to mitigate the rising cost of living for families.  I provided an additional &euro;100 increase in the rate of the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for each qualifying child.  This brings the rate for children aged 4&ndash;11 years to &euro;260, and &euro;385 for children aged 12 and over.  This will benefit over 262,000 children.  </p>  <p>  I am also inviting an additional 310 recently designated DEIS schools to participate in the School Meals programme which will benefit almost 60,000 additional children.  In addition, my colleague Minister Foley announced that students availing of the school transport scheme will not be charged fees for the next academic year.  These measures will cost an additional &euro;67 million and will help struggling families with back-to-school costs.  </p>  <p>  The Government continues to monitor the situation carefully in preparation for the Budget.  I will be meeting a range of NGOs at the Department's pre-budget forum later this month and will listen carefully to the views expressed by all organisations including, I hope, Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. </p>  <p>  This Government has provided timely, targeted support and I will continue to prioritise evidence-based measures aimed at supporting the most vulnerable in our society. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another social welfare payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income. </p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes except for Fuel Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  Incapacity Supplement is an increase payable in addition to Disablement Benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit such as Illness Benefit.  This Incapacity Supplement is a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, while Disablement Benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for Fuel Allowance because a person may continue to or take up work, or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for Incapacity Supplement in addition to Disablement Benefit qualifies that recipient for Fuel Allowance (subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria).</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to prepare a report reviewing the treatment of Disablement Benefit under the Fuel Allowance scheme.  This report has now been finalised and the report's contents and recommendations will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides supports and services to help support people on low incomes and facing financial hardship. </p><p>The additional needs payment is an overarching term for exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements paid under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.  This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million for the provision of exceptional and urgent needs that are provided for as Additional Needs Payment in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).  The scheme is demand led and funding is not capped.  The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently receiving a social welfare payment or working on a low income. </p><p>An exceptional needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. </p><p>Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>While it is not possible to show the payment value for each individual ENP and UNP paid for the months in question, tables 1 and 2 show the breakdown by category of the number and total expenditure of ENPs and UNPs paid in each of the months for October 2021 to end of March 2022.</p><p>This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 4th July 2022 and is subject to change.</p><p>A Heating Supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have exceptional heating costs over and above the normal due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition that has been certified by a Registered General Practitioner and are unable to meet those costs out of household income. </p><p>Heating supplements are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme.  All the relevant circumstances of the case are taken into account in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p><p>Guidance is provided to assist staff and does not limit the discretionary powers available to officers administering the scheme to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. </p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the guidance issued to the Community Welfare Service officers on the Heating Supplement scheme is kept under review to ensure that it continues to support those most in need of assistance.  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of a particular case he should bring the details to the attention of the Department. </p><p>Approximately 1,100 people benefited from this supplement in 2020 and approximately 1,000 in 2021.  There are currently 946 claimants in receipt of a heating supplement.  Table 3 shows the total number of heating supplement recipients at the end of each month for October 2021 to March 2022.</p><p>More generally, my Department also provides discretionary Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) where appropriate to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  In 2021, over 2,300 exceptional needs payments totaling almost &euro;750,000 were made to assist with household bills and heating costs.  To the end of June 2022, some 1,450 exceptional needs payments totaling almost &euro;530,000 were made to assist with household bills and heating costs.  </p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to a payment under the SWA Scheme is encouraged to contact their local Intreo Centre.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Table 1 - The number by category of ENPs and UNPs paid in October/ November/December 2021, and January/February/March 2022.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Category </th>       <th>October 2021 </th>       <th>November 2021 </th>       <th>December 2021 </th>       <th>January 2022 </th>       <th>February 2022 </th>       <th>March 2022 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bills </td>       <td>124 </td>       <td>147 </td>       <td>106 </td>       <td>125 </td>       <td>148 </td>       <td>197 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Related </td>       <td>161 </td>       <td>193 </td>       <td>129 </td>       <td>129</td>       <td>170 </td>       <td>172 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clothing </td>       <td>865 </td>       <td>975 </td>       <td>809 </td>       <td>531 </td>       <td>630 </td>       <td>1,280 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Funeral </td>       <td>202 </td>       <td>222 </td>       <td>137 </td>       <td>193 </td>       <td>252 </td>       <td>238 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General </td>       <td>1,213 </td>       <td>1,298 </td>       <td>1,351 </td>       <td>941</td>       <td>1,088</td>       <td>1,512</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing </td>       <td>2,009 </td>       <td>2,117 </td>       <td>1,844 </td>       <td>1,557 </td>       <td>1,834 </td>       <td>1,781 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness </td>       <td>102 </td>       <td>115 </td>       <td>75 </td>       <td>94 </td>       <td>104 </td>       <td>103 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Urgent Needs Payment</td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>36 </td>       <td>38 </td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>25 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>4,700 </td>       <td>5,103 </td>       <td>4,489 </td>       <td>3,596</td>       <td>4,251</td>       <td>5,328</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Note: </b>These figures are taken from the Department's ENP/UNP database and represent a snapshot of ENPs/UNPs as they are approved by an officer rather than when they are paid.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.902.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300103#WRP02900"><p>Claimants with cohabiting partners are recognised within the social welfare system as having additional  needs in cases where their cohabiting partner is financially dependent upon them.  The payment of an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) in addition to the personal rate of payment reflects these additional household needs.</p>  <p>  The IQA is payable in respect of a person who is wholly or mainly maintained by the customer, subject to a means test, regardless of whether the couple are married or not.  Where one member of a cohabiting couple claims a means-tested social assistance payment, their partner's income is taken into account in the means test.  </p>  <p>  In regard to schemes, neither the Widow(er)&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory nor the Non-Contributory Pension are payable to surviving cohabiting partners who have not entered into marriage or a civil partnership with the person they were cohabiting with.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between cohabiting couples. </p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is regulated by the Minister for Justice.  Aside from the wider legal issues regarding the status of marriage and civil partnerships, which is a much broader policy area than its implications for the income support schemes of my Department, extending the current provisions to people who have not undertaken equivalent legal obligations would carry significant costs.  Estimating the extent of the costs is not currently possible. It would also raise significant issues about eligibility criteria if these were to be based upon cohabitation</p>  <p>  Therefore, any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for the widow(er)&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner's pension, be it contributory or non-contributory, would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations, as well as any legal issues that may arise.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a Widow/er or Surviving Civil Partner with dependent children may qualify for One-Parent Family Payment.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 1,034,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Estimating the cost of extending the free travel scheme to students aged 18 to 24 who hold a Public Services Card is very difficult, as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the increased number.  The fact that many operators have reduced fares for students would also have to be considered. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Free Travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community and, while consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the Free Travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the Free Travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p>  <p>  Any such scheme would also require a fundamental expansion to the administrative set up and operation of the Free Travel scheme, as it would have to grant and withdraw potentially hundreds of thousands of passes each year, using information which would have to be provided by all the colleges in the State in the case of higher education students.  Any proposals in this regard would have to be considered in the context of priorities for the Free Travel scheme and the budgetary implications of same. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, and additional living expenses. </p><p>Indecon also identified that there is not a single typical cost of disability; rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs, depending on individual circumstances. </p><p>As the findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-Government perspective is needed. </p><p>This is why the Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which Is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability.  This group comprises of relevant departments, agencies, a Disability Stakeholder Group and people with disabilities.  The group will consider and monitor recommended actions required by the various Government Departments bi-annually. </p><p>From the perspective of the Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers, which reflect some of the findings of the report.  These included a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards as well as supports to employers.</p><p>The estimated additional annual cost to the Exchequer of a weekly cost of disability payment of &euro;20 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <td>285,958* </td>       <td>x&euro;20 </td>       <td>x 52wks</td>       <td>&euro;297m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Note: the estimate is based only on persons in receipt of the following payments (at the end of May 2022): Domiciliary Care Allowance, Partial Capacity Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Disablement Benefit.  The cost of such an approach would increase, as other payment groups may need to be included, given demographic trends and other factors.</p><p>It is important to note that the above approach is not in line with the cost of disability report conclusions.  </p><p>The report notes that the concentration of any additional supports should be targeted on those most in need and who face the greatest additional costs of disability - that this approach would be more effective in meeting policy objectives and in enhancing value for money than in introducing additional small scale supports for those who face minor additional costs of disability.  </p><p>The report also indicated that the levels of disability payments and allowances should be changed to reflect the very different costs of disability by severity and type of disability.</p><p>Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, the Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to &lsquo;simplify the system, remove inconsistencies/anomalies, recognise the continuum of disability and to support employment&rsquo;. Work on a &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal is underway by officials, and the proposal will take on board the recommendations of the Indecon report, with a public consultation process to commence in due course.</p></reply>

CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding. </p>  <p>  Therefore, pay and conditions are matters for the employer and not my Department -  as the employees concerned are not public servants, but employees of individual schemes.  Any claim that would potentially increase the overall costs of running schemes or state funded activities in the wider community and voluntary sector would need to be considered in the wider budgetary context. </p>  <p>  My department acknowledges the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes in delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>  My department is fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve CE for the benefit of the supervisors and participants, given the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is based on average payment rates.</p>  <p>  Both Illness Benefit and Occupational Injury Benefit apply a period of three waiting days. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working on the introduction of Statutory Sick Pay which would cover the first three days of illness in the first year of operation, extending to ten days over time.  Entitlement will be subject to the employee having worked for their employer for a minimum of 13 weeks and providing a medical certificate.  This will cover the vast majority of employees.  Many of the people not covered for Statutory Sick Pay due to short duration of service are unlikely to meet the criteria for Illness Benefit of a minimum of 104 contributions and the criteria as to when those contributions were made.  It is not possible to estimate the number of people who would be eligible for Illness Benefit and Occupational Injury Benefit but not eligible for Statutory Sick Pay.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Meetings of the forum are scheduled on a quarterly basis. The forum provides a space for representative organisations to highlight issues from the perspective of people with disabilities; to discuss solutions; and to share views and perspectives on policy and operational matters.  The forum includes a wide membership of disability organisations, the National Disability Authority and representatives from the Citizens Information Board. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department hosts an annual Pre-Budget Forum, which disability representative bodies attend. This will take place later this month. The Department invites submissions from disability representative bodies as part of the Forum.</p>  <p>  My Department also hosts two meetings of its Community and Voluntary pillar each year, which representatives from the sector attend. The Department is also represented on various groups, such as, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group with representatives from the sector.</p>  <p>  As part of its commitment under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, my Department convenes quarterly meetings of its Disability Consultative Committee. This committee is attended by the Disability Stakeholders Group and a National Disability Authority representative. This committee discusses and monitors delivery of the Department&rsquo;s commitments under the Strategy. The Disability Stakeholders Group reports twice a year to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group on the progress the Department has made.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department hosts its Annual Carers Forum as part of its commitments under the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. The purpose of the Forum is to provide carers with a voice at policy level.  It also provides an opportunity for engagement between officials and people experiencing care issues first-hand.</p>  <p>  My Department also consults widely as part of it review processes. Currently the Department is reviewing its Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants.  As part of this review, a public consultation was undertaken from the end of March to mid&ndash;May.  To reach as many people as possible the consultation was publicised using print, radio and digital media channels. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department presented at two information sessions held by the Disability Participation and Consultation Network.  This network has been established by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as part of an approach to ensure effective consultation with the sector, as required under the UN Convention on the Rights Of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD).</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the National Disability Authority are developing an implementation approach with regard to the UNCRPD, including consultation processes.  Once approved, the approaches identified are to be adopted by departments and their agencies as part of their own implementation planning.</p></reply>

It is a targeted payment to people dependent on specified long-term social welfare payments.  The purpose of this payment is to assist those households most in need with their energy costs.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including a means test and the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment is targeted at those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  Saying that, I am acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households who are dependent on social welfare.</p>  <p>  All options, including the suggestion in the question, will be kept under review, together with trends in prices, to inform preparations for the budget later this year. We will, however, have to take account, as always, of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the primary income support through which the Department supports carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness, including mental illness.  The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency, be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that in setting income limits, as is necessary with all means-tested payments, there are always people whose incomes will just be above that limit. The creation of a second band, as outlined by the Deputy, would naturally lead to another limit that people will just be above. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced significant improvements to the means test for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society. These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years.</p>  <p>  -  The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  -  For carer&rsquo;s who work, the weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p>  <p>  The changes outlined came into effect on 2 June and many Carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will now be brought into the Carers Allowance system for the first time.  </p>  <p>  The Carer's Allowance disregards are the most generous income disregards in the social welfare system and mean, in the case of a couple, that earnings of up to &euro;39,000 p.a. are disregarded. By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week. For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%. For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means. </p>  <p>  Any additional changes to the Carer&rsquo; Allowance means test would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

There is a range of schemes available to people who make Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Entitlement to such schemes is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria.  Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension are two such non means tested income supports.</p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme allows a person who is in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for 26 weeks) to enter or return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment.  Following a medical assessment, if a person's restriction regarding their capacity for work is rated as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% of their previous payment while in employment.  Partial Capacity Benefit has also been designed so there are no restrictions/limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work.</p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  Disability Allowance and Blind Pension are two such schemes, which are also subject to a medical assessment and habitual residency requirement.</p>  <p>  Both Disability Allowance and Blind Pension have been designed to support recipients to pursue employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  When a person commences employment, an income disregard of &euro;140 per week is applied. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test. </p>  <p>  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme has been designed to support persons, including persons with disabilities, to become self-employed. It allows a person to retain 100% of their payment in year one and 75% in year two.  This includes any increases for a qualified adult, and qualified children in payment. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting, that under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, the Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to - simplify the system, remove inconsistencies/anomalies, recognise the continuum of disability and to support employment.  Work is currently underway within the Department, with a public consultation process to commence in due course.</p></reply>

As part of the implementation of Phase 1 of the National Action Plan for Childminding, Budget 2022 enabled the recruitment of an additional 6 Childminding Development Officer posts within the CCCs as well as a national CCC Childminding Lead whose work includes overseeing and coordinating the team of 12 Childminding Development Officers. As the Childminding Development Officers work on a regional basis in collaboration with the CCCs in each region, the team of Childminding Development Officers provides full national coverage.   </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Action Plan for Childminding, the role of the Childminding Development Officers is to prepare the childminding sector for the move towards wider regulation and support, while also in the immediate term supporting childminders who are subject to the current regulations but are not yet registered with Tusla to meet Tusla registration requirements, thus enabling more childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme and other State supports. </p>  <p>  The full-year cost of the 12 Childminding Development Officer posts that are now in place is &euro;843,000 per annum, which includes costs for salaries, PRSI, travel and subsistence and overheads. </p>  <p>  The Childminding Development Officers are employed by the City/County Childcare Committees, and the costs of each post vary between counties. Assuming that the average cost of employing a single Childminding Development Officer, including all related employment costs as well as overheads, is approximately &euro;70,000 per annum, the additional cost of employing 15 additional full-time Childminding Development Officers would be approximately &euro;1 million per annum.</p></reply>

If this same level of bursary were to be extended to the cohort referenced above, the cost would be &euro;4.9 million to support 6,520 early years educators.</p><p>However, this would not mean that the degree-level qualification was free-of-charge for participants as my Department only partly funds early years educators to pursue a higher qualification under the Learner Fund. The full cost is significantly higher with a substantial proportion being borne by early years educators. </p><p>To estimate the cost of ensuring that the upskilling were free-of-charge to staff, a sample of relevant part-time degree programmes was examined, in which the annual fees were found to range from &euro;3,150 to &euro;4,990 per year. The Professional Award Criteria and Guidelines for Initial Professional Education (Level 7 and 8) degree programmes for the Early Learning and Care sector in Ireland, published in April 2019, set the standard of new Level 7 ELC qualifications at 3 years in duration. In the sample of degree programmes examined, the total cost per student would therefore range from &euro;9,450 to &euro;14,970. If this full cost were to be covered for 6,520 early years educators, the total cost to the State would be between &euro;61.6 million and &euro;97.6 million.</p><p>In December last, I published <i>Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022 to 2028</i>. <i>Nurturing Skills</i>commits to the provision of funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for current early years educators. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. </p><p>The new funding scheme will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to early learning and care services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed.</p></reply>

It is intended to commence the amended 2015 Act as soon as is possible following the enactment of the Amendment Bill. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the abolition of wardship and to replacing it with a more person-centred and rights-based functional capacity model.

It will be introduced to the Seanad when the Houses resume in the autumn and will be progressed as quickly as possible in the autumn session. It is intended to have the Bill enacted, and the 2015 Act commenced, at the earliest possible opportunity. </p>  <p>  Once the amended Act is commenced, the Decision Support Service will become fully operational.  The Decision Support Service (DSS), which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act, will respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties. The preparations of the Decision Support Service have gone well, and have been supported by an Inter-Departmental Steering Group. The DSS is in the process of finalising its own procedures for going live and will be ready to operate the progressive provisions of the new legislation when the legislation is commenced.</p></reply>

All services for international protection (IP) applicants are mainstreamed. Applicants access health services through the same referral pathways as Irish citizens, including referrals to medical and psychological support services through primary care, GP referral and emergency services.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service's (IPAS) response is based on needs that are identified through referrals to the Resident Welfare team. This team utilises community based services that specialise in supporting those that are misusing drugs and alcohol and any other psychological and welfare needs. Each referral is triaged and discussed with a social work team. </p>  <p>  The social work team comprises of three social work team leaders. Upon discussion, it is decided that a member of the social work team complete a welfare check in respect of a IP applicant. This involves a conversation with the IP applicant, and can also include a separate conversation with the centre manager. The social work team leader undertaking the welfare check seeks consent from the IP applicant and then contacts appropriate local services/agencies that are able to assist issues/difficulties identified.</p>  <p>  IPAS, through Vulnerability Assessments, identifies needs and supports for difficulties such as drug and alcohol dependency. The HSE Social Inclusion Officer may also be contacted to avail of any HSE supports. NGOs working with different centres are contacted to support the IP applicant. IPAS&rsquo;s National Reception Centre (Balseskin) Medical Centre has psychology services that identifies dependency difficulties early and provides brief support for IP applicants when they are in the National Reception Centre and make onward referrals on dispersal if required.</p>  <p>  I trust that that this information can provide you the necessary reassurance that the Government is committed to the welfare of all residents of accommodation centres.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.1095.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300106#WRS04200"><p>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) as the means through which the cost of childcare is to be reduced. </p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced an end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families since 2 May 2022. I also announced the extension of the universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children. Full year estimates of these changes have been factored into the costs below but the impact of these changes will not be fully known until Q4 2022.</p><p>It is not feasible to consistently apply a subsidy to all families using the NCS which would result in the same flat payment for all families.</p><p>To model on closest equivalence the estimated costs below are based on the hourly rate of a full-time service at the average national full-time rate. The average hourly fee rate is applied across all model types. The costings above are based on the average fee rate per the sector profile 20/21, which is &euro;186.84, which equates to &euro;4.15 per hour for a 45 hour user. Therefore the below costings are meant to be indicative only and should be interpreted with caution as the fees can vary greatly depending on the age of the child, the location and the provider. </p><p><b>-  Age -</b>The average weekly fees for different types of provision vary depending on the age of the child. The level of fees decrease as the child gets older, both for full day and part-time provision. The highest fees charged are for babies up to 1 year (&euro;192.06 for full day), while provision for children aged between 5 to 6 years is the lowest at &euro;178.64 for full day.</p><p><b>-  Location -</b>The level of fees charged by services varies depending on their location. Differences are observed both between counties and also within counties depending on the level of affluence or disadvantage of the community in which the service is located. It is worth noting that averages can mask significant variations within counties. For example, the highest weekly full day fee charged by an individual service was in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown (&euro;324.35). However, the lowest weekly fee charged in the same local authority was &euro;134. Historically, fees are higher in urban areas and along the East coast.</p><p><b>-  Provider - </b>As a general principle, services charge a fixed fee across which applies across a banded number of hours per day (a session). These models may, for example, follow the session types outlined in regulation. These are:</p><p>-  Less than 3.5 hours</p><p>-  3.5 to 5 hours</p><p>-  Greater than 5 hours</p><p>In practical terms, this means that any given service may have the same &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; fee whether, for example, a parent regularly uses 6 hours or 8 hours.</p><p>The NCS subsidies are calculated based on hours used, so, from the above example, the parent may pay a higher co-payment for using <i>less</i>hours within those session bands by virtue of the lower subsidy available for lower hours.</p><p>The estimates are derived from current levels of usage and expenditure adjusted for the Budget 22 changes. <b>These individual estimates are based on no behavioural change and should be interpreted with caution</b>. </p><p>It should be noted that changes to subsidies may result in changes to patterns and levels of usage by families. These changes are likely to be more pronounced as the cost of childcare to parents reduces. The respective estimated costs are in addition to the existing costs associated with the provision of the NCS. <table>    <tr>       <th>Effective reduction in cost to:</th>       <th>Approximate Cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;50 weekly</td>       <td>&euro;270 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;100 monthly</td>       <td>&euro;255 million</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level.</p><p>- An <b>income-related subsidy</b>is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider.  The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount). </p><p>Significant investment is being made by my Department to address affordability for parents through the NCS. I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of last year's Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents. Firstly, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours.</p><p>Secondly, from September 2022, the upper age eligibility for the NCS Universal Award will change from 3 years to 15 years. This means that the minimum rate for an NCS Award will be raised to 50 cents for all children under 15.</p><p>These changes taken together mean that the parents of the child referred to in the question will be eligible for the NCS universal subsidy for after school care in September and, depending on their means, may be eligible for a universal subsidy.</p><p>Funding for the NCS will increase over the coming three years, to improve the affordability of childcare for parents.  The amounts of NCS funding for each year will be set in the relevant Budgets. </p></reply>

The purpose of the programme is to attract high achieving world class talent who might not have considered undertaking a PhD programme or, if they had, would not have considered Ireland as a location.</p>  <p>  The support package being developed for I4I is designed with comparable international programmes in mind, and will apply only to students qualifying for the programme, i.e., an initial tranche of 400 students. The next step in implementing this proposal will be a competitive call for proposals from consortia of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), this is being developed and should be initiated later this year.  Thus, details of the scheme are still under development and the final shape of the scheme  will be framed once proposals have been received and fully assessed.</p>  <p>  It is similarly too early to comment on what impact a new competitive research funding agency might have in this space, other than to observe that the new agency will be supporting researchers at all career stages, building on the strengths of both of the existing agencies</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the stipend is not the only source of funding available to PhD students. My Department also supports students through SUSI at all levels, including PhD.</p>  <p>  In relation to whether the I4I stipend will be taxable income, I wish to advise that taxation policy is a matter for the Department of Finance, and that it&rsquo;s a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine tax liability in any individual case, but there is an exemption for stipends given to people in full-time education. I am advised that the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides, in certain circumstances, for a tax disregard for an exhibition, bursary or other similar educational endowment</p>  <p>  On the issue of stipends in general, my Department provides funding for postgraduate research through both Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC). Funding is also provided by other statutory funders and, of course, private funders.  Some students also self-fund. Stipends are frequently a feature of funding globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research</p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In that regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarship by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%.

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to over &euro;357m for more than 146,000 eligible higher education students in 2020/2021.

The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. Currently Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for the postgraduate special rate of maintenance grant. The income threshold for this grant is &euro;24,500, also special rate postgraduate students are eligible to have their post graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. All other postgraduate students who earn below the income threshold of &euro;54,240 in 2021/22 qualify for postgraduate fee contribution of &euro;3,500. </p>  <p>  To date there have been 5,266 applications at postgraduate level for the 2021/22 academic year, of which circa 3,900 have been awarded. Of these circa 1,000 have been awarded the special rate of grant, which includes a maintenance payment of up to &euro;5,915. The estimated cost to restore maintenance grants to the remaining grant holders who are in receipt of a "fee only grant" would be in the region of &euro;7.5m for a full year. This would benefit in the region of 2,600 students currently receiving a fee only grant based on 2021/22 awards of which 90% are paid. Not all grant holders who are awarded a grant are paid out for a variety of factors including failure to attend the course. As the 2021/22 application process has not yet been finalised due to issues such as ongoing appeals or outstanding queries to applicants, it is not possible at this stage to give the total amount of funding that has been paid out to this cohort.</p></reply>

I am committed to continuing the process of investing in our higher education system and to the development and implementation of a sustainable funding, reform and performance model for the sector. On 4th May I launched the Funding the Future framework which includes the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future of higher education.</p><p>The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our ambitions to drive reform and support agility and responsiveness in the sector, and the need to ensure that students are supported in accessing education and training. This includes:</p><p>- Planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.</p><p>- Plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education, and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant in line with the Student Grant Review.</p><p>The provision of Higher Education funding on an annual basis is part of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy for Government. It is of course imperative that funding is made available to my Department to support these plans and I will be seeking to have the additional funding required to address the identified core funding gap and also to address costs for students of attending higher education as part of the annual Estimates processes over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Plan promotes general access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship through targeted actions to encourage participation from under-represented groups including people with disabilities, women, ethnic minorities and those from marginalised and disadvantaged groups in general.</p><p>Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the further development of the apprenticeship system. It is envisaged that the subcommittee will include representation from second-level, community education, youth justice programmes, broader FET provision, and higher education.</p><p>The National Apprenticeship Office will increase the visibility of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship literature and promotional material to reflect the participation and positive experience of people from all backgrounds and communities, as well as the availability of assistive supports.</p><p>Participation targets for under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups, will be set with the Equity of Access Subcommittee and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions supporting increased diversity within the apprentice population. Indicators are currently being developed which will enable us to best identify target groups and a response will be shaped with input from representatives of these groups.</p><p>Work on the development of the new National Access Plan: A Strategic Action Plan for Equity of Access, Participation and Success in Higher Education, 2022 &ndash; 2028 is almost complete.  The consultation process was an extensive one which received 122 submissions from a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>The consultation process highlighted the importance of recognising and naming additional &lsquo;priority groups&rsquo;, which are groups considered marginalised or disadvantaged.  One such group that arose during the consultation process is students who have experience of the criminal justice system and is being considered as a named priority group in the new Plan. A Memorandum for Government will be brought to cabinet before the summer recess with the intention of publishing the new Plan in Q3.</p><p>In 2019, Maynooth University and Mountjoy Prison came together to establish Ireland&rsquo;s first university-prison partnership. The MJMU Partnership aims to harness the transformative power of education to promote access to third level and support the reintegration of prisoners and former prisoners in society. Maynooth University support engagement by the University within the space of the prison through a range of educational activities and through the creation of shared learning spaces for students in prison and students in university. </p><p>Building on the work which has already been taking place between the university and Mountjoy, the partnership provides strategic direction and support for a range of new initiatives, including being the lead institution which has developed the KickStart scholarship for people with criminal convictions on a pilot basis in 2022/2023 academic year. MU is working in partnership with 3 other institutions - Dublin City University, Dundalk Institute of Technology and Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest, Athlone Campus. The KickStart Scholarship Fund is an initiative established by the Irish Probation Service and supported by the Irish Prison Service. It aims to support people with a criminal justice history who face financial challenges in accessing Higher Education. This scholarship initiative builds on the existing partnership between Maynooth University and Mountjoy Prison (MJMU Partnership) and the recent successful launch of the Unlocking Potential website and toolkit for fair admissions policies for people with convictions.</p><p>The Kickstart Scholarship Fund is considered as an income disregard when calculating reckonable income for the Student Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution required from the apprentice.</p>  <p>  For craft apprenticeships, the ASC charged is typically one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT.  In the case of consortia-led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as off-the-job training has a more flexible structure, ranging from periods of block release to one day per week or remote learning options.  </p>  <p>  If the ASC was removed, with the apprentice paying examination fees only, then the cost to the State is estimated at an average &euro;267 per apprentice per annum.  Based on a current population of  23,639 registered apprentices, the estimated cost is &euro;6.3m per annum. An estimated 50% reduction in the ASC to apprentices would cost an estimated &euro;3.15m and a 20% reduction in the ASC to apprentices would cost an estimated &euro;1.26m per annum.</p></reply>

Her appeal was heard by the independent Student Grant Appeals Board on 5th   July 2022 and the determination was issued directly to the student.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.

This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

This is reflected in the governance structures established under Impact 2030:  Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment develops intellectual property policy, prepares legislation and provides an intellectual property regime which reflects the international law environment and best practice.</p>  <p>  A competitive IP protection regime supports the creation of proprietary knowledge and simultaneously encourages its exploitation by rewarding the knowledge creators. A fit-for-purpose IP regime acts therefore as an important driver of innovation, leading to economic and employment growth.</p>  <p>  Optimising the transfer of knowledge from our public research system to enterprise has been central to our strategy for science and innovation for many years. We have built up capacity within the public research system to engage with industry on issues relating to intellectual property, and we have assisted industry &ndash; and SMEs in particular &ndash; to absorb research outputs and to engage with the academic research community. </p>  <p>  A well-functioning intellectual property framework is key to providing companies that are researching and developing new medicinal products with the certainty that if a medicine makes it to the market, it can be protected, for a specific period time, from being copied or used by another party without the permission of the rightsholder.  </p>  <p>  The national IP Protocol, published by Knowledge Transfer Ireland, sets out the Government&rsquo;s policies to encourage industry to benefit from publicly-funded research and describes the practical arrangements for this to happen. It serves to encourage innovation from Irish research and the commercialisation of all forms of intellectual property arising from the publicly-funded research sector.</p>  <p>  Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are one of the principal means through which companies, creators and inventors generate returns on their investment in research, innovation and creativity.  IPRs are a crucial incentive for the development of new and innovative medicinal products, enabling the research and development necessary for the creation of many of today&rsquo;s medicines and provide the incentive to encourage companies to continue to invest in the development of new treatments, medicinal products, and vaccines.</p>  <p>As Intellectual Property rights fall under the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, my Department and I have regular engagement with our colleagues there on a wide range of issues, including intellectual property rights when necessary.   </p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and during all levels of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. Regrettably, the current average processing time for naturalisation applications is approximately 23 months.</p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.

These forms are available to all staff on the Prison Service intranet portal PRISM, from the Governor of the prison or from Corporate Services Directorate. </p>  <p>  All nominations should be sent to the Local Staff Recognition Committee for the institution for consideration. This committee comprises of management representatives, staff association members and other staff of that prison or business support centre.  The role of these committees is to investigate and gather information in relation to the incident and verify the facts of the matter before making a recommendation to the Prison Service National Staff Recognition Committee (National Committee). </p>  <p>  As part of the process the Governor of the prison or the business support centre also confirms that they know of no reason why the nomination form cannot go forward for consideration to the National Committee.</p>  <p>  The National Committee consider the nominations and supporting information. This Committee makes the decision in relation to nominations for Commendation awards itself and makes recommendations to the Director General in relation to the nomination for award of a Brian Stack Medal or a Distinguished Services Medal.  </p>  <p>  The Director General makes a decision based on the recommendation of the National Committee and on any other information available. All decisions are communicated to the local staff recognition committee.</p>  <p>  In the event that a review is sought, the Irish Prison Service Staff Recognition Policy provides for a formal review by the Director of Human Resources. </p></reply>

My Department shares this value and is committed to building and maintaining an inclusive workplace environment, which enables, supports and encourages contributions from all members of staff.  To that end, I am committed to ensuring that equality, diversity and inclusion are embedded in my Department&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department launched its first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy in March 2022. The Strategy aims to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capabilities to promote equality, embrace diversity and foster inclusion, not only in our daily interactions and activities as colleagues, but also in the design and delivery of the services that we provide to the public.</p>  <p>  The EDI Strategy prioritises three main areas of focus for strategic impact: </p>  <p>  - achieve better policy outcomes and improve the accessibility and quality of our services;</p>  <p>  - support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce which is reflective of the diversity within our population / country;</p>  <p>  - build and embed a workplace culture which facilitates, supports and encourages contributions from all.</p>  <p>  Each of these strategic outcomes are underpinned by a number of actions which the Department will implement over the life of the EDI Strategy. These actions will be integrated into our business plans including adding appropriate indicators and monitored along with other organisation goals and strategic priorities. For example, as part of our objective to support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce, training on a range of EDI related areas such as disability awareness, intercultural relations, managing inclusivity will be rolled out and embedded in training programmes and induction. </p>  <p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our values and processes should reflect this. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will proactively collaborate with PAS and other key stakeholders on recruitment &amp;amp; retention initiatives that support our EDI agenda, including by working to ensure eligible candidates from all communities in Ireland today, including members of the LGBTQIA+ community, are supported and encouraged to apply for any applicable competitions as they may arise. </p></reply>

It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make this the most ambitious Strategy to date, and in particular to make a real impact on the provision of refuge units and other associated support services, will require additional expenditure. The Strategy also places significant emphasis on working with all of society to combat the underlying assumptions and attitudes that can lead to violence against women. This includes working in an appropriate way with younger people, including in the context of the education system </p>  <p>  The implementation plan published alongside the Strategy is for actions to be progressed between now and the end of next year, at which point the next implementation plan will be published. The implementation plan sets out how each of the aims of the Strategy will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them, and the timeframe for delivery, so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable. </p>  <p>  There was regular constructive engagement between officials from my Department and the Department of Education during the drafting process for both the Strategy and the implementation plan. I also met with Minister Foley in May to discuss the Strategy and the important actions that the Department of Education will take forward. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education has had and will continue to have a vital role to play in the development and implementation of the Strategy, particularly in relation to teacher education; raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence issues; anti-bullying policy and updating the curriculum for Relationships and Sexuality Education in Primary and Post-Primary schools. </p></reply>

In the development of its Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy, my Department consulted with stakeholders from several disability stakeholder groups. The feedback has played a significant role in informing and strengthening the development of its EDI strategy. </p>  <p>  As part of its work regarding awareness raising campaigns, the Department convened a working group on Campaign Evaluation and Measurement. The group has reviewed several frameworks to shape campaign planning and is developing a guide for colleagues based on this work. The Department&rsquo;s Access Officer has been asked to input to a checklist document for campaign planning to ensure that accessibility issues are considered at an early stage.</p>  <p>  The checklist document requires that any campaign team consult with Internal and External stakeholders in a way that reflects the Department&rsquo;s responsibilities and commitments to:</p>  <p>  - Inclusive stakeholder groups</p>  <p>  - Accessible outreach. </p>  <p>  - Language inclusivity.</p>  <p>  - Offering opportunities for all to be heard.</p>  <p>  I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the agencies, bodies and offices under the remit of my Department in relation to implementation of action 32 of the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that many of the agencies and bodies under the aegis of my Department have informed me that they actively engage with staff who have disabilities to ensure that their working environment and specific needs are addressed. </p>  <p>  Additionally, as part of the Courts Service Modernisation Programme, engagements with a wide variety of stakeholder groups is ongoing, including with bodies that represent people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In line with strategic objective 4 of the Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy 2019-2021, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) established a Garda National Diversity Forum to monitor and review the implementation of the strategy and also to act as a critical friend. The Forum is made up of 15 representatives of communities and key stakeholders from across the entire diversity spectrum and also includes, as invited guests, the Policing Authority. The Irish Criminal Justice Disability Network (ICJDN) is also represented on the Garda National Diversity Forum. </p>  <p>  While the monitoring function of the Forum is to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out the commitments in the strategy, the Forum also provides a link to minority communities and are a voice for concerns within those communities. </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) have advised me that they have engaged with the National Advocacy Service to provide assistance and improved accessibility to its services. I understand GSOC also attend National Disability Authority conferences in order to be engaged and up to date on legislation and best practice.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Data Protection Commission (DPC) is on track to meet of all its commitments under the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, and that the DPC is committed to engagement with people with disabilities and has had engagement in public consultation, e.g. the DPC's consultation on Children's Rights, where they identified and engaged with relevant groups.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA) seek engagements with persons with disabilities through their research and consultation work on an ongoing basis, and are still working through their statutory reporting agenda with that in mind where feasible.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board has assured me that they are committed to ensuring people with disabilities have equal access to legal advice. The Legal Aid Board has appointed an Access Officer in accordance with the Disability Act and the Access Officer is responsible for providing or arranging for, and coordinating assistance and guidance, to persons with disabilities accessing services provided by the Board. The Board also has in place Disability Liaison Officers (DLO) whose role is to assist and support staff with disabilities by providing necessary information, appropriate contacts, guidance, suggestions and advice. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Legal Aid Board established an External Consultative Panel a number of years ago. The purpose of this panel is to provide a forum to enable the Board to keep stakeholders informed and updated on relevant developments in the areas in which the Board has an interest and to facilitate stakeholders to provide feedback and assistance to the Board on the Board&rsquo;s services from the perspective and informed position of the stakeholder. The Citizens Information Board (CIB) has a representative on the Panel. The CIB has a mandate to advocate for people with disabilities and supports that National Advocacy Service (NAS) for people with disabilities. In January 2022 representatives from the Disability Federation of Ireland also joined the Panel.</p></reply>

It is also cognisant of the challenges that were highlighted and intensified at the early stages of the pandemic and seeks to learn from these experiences, including access to medicines. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made to date on the delivery of actions laid out in the Implementation Plan, with some of the mechanisms of delivery addressing more than one of the desired actions. (55 outlined actions both legislative and non-legislative which will operationally realise the objectives of the strategy). These include revision of the General Pharmaceutical, Orphan and Paediatric legislation work to define/set criteria for unmet need, creation of the Health Emergency Response Authority, Structured Dialogue Initiative, and Clinical Trials Regulation.</p>  <p>  A status report on the implementation actions is expected to be tabled at the next Pharmaceutical Committee meeting due to be held in October 2022. </p>  <p>  Strategic considerations relating to issues around availability, accessibility and affordability of medicines, medicines shortages, the enhanced use of digitalisation in the context of its role and potential in facilitating market access, are of importance. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has established a Cross Departmental/Agency Group with key Stakeholders with differing perspectives so as to be best equipped and informed to react holistically from a national perspective as the implementation of the strategy progresses.  Representatives from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment are members of this group.  The Group has already held two meetings with a third one planned for early Autumn.</p>  <p>  At a European level the Department of Health also attends Directorate General Sante meetings where Pharmaceutical Strategy Priorities are discussed with other Member States. Ireland is actively involved at these meetings ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s views are expressed.</p>  <p>Finally, insofar as the White Paper on Enterprise is concerned, at the request of the Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, the Government agreed in March this year to the development of this White Paper which is being led by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.  The White Paper will set out set out an ambitious medium- to long-term direction for enterprise policy in response to challenges, opportunities and new drivers of growth catalysed by the Covid-19 pandemic, new economic and geopolitical realities, and an increased urgency to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry.  In so doing, the White Paper will articulate what needs to be done differently to realise this vision and to set out clearly the risks to be faced - such as energy, skills availability, technological change, etc. - and the policy choices and trade-offs that will arise in order to maintain high-quality jobs, to protect the elements which make Ireland&rsquo;s economy globally attractive for investment and to ensure a competitive Irish economy into the future.  The Tanaiste announced his Department&rsquo;s public consultation on the White Paper on 3rd   July and details are at www.enterprise.gov.ie Public consultation on the preparation of the White Paper on Enterprise - DETE</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>.</p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 8 July, 68,943<b></b>eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 20,000 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 88,943. All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment. As eligibility is still being assessed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with an estimated number of public service workers who are eligible to receive the payment.  </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; <br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </blockquote>  <p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place. </p><p>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers highlighted above has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers who will receive the payment. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible. </p></reply>

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.</p><p>Many of the recommendations of the <i>National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018)</i>have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.</p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p><p>In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.</p><p>The Clinical Genetics service at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin was founded in 1995 and provides a diagnostic, counselling and clinical genetic testing service for children and adults affected by or at risk of a genetic condition. </p><p>The service is the main provider of general genetic counselling to the population of the Republic of Ireland. It cares for and manages families with genetic conditions, rather than simply focusing on individual patients. </p><p>Currently there are four Consultant Geneticists in CHI at Crumlin. I am pleased to advise that two vacant posts have been approved by the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee and have been advertised with a closing date of 22nd of July 2022. A locum post is also currently in place.  </p><p>To support the progression of Genomics and the development of a national genomics network work a single vision for the future of genomics is required. The Department of Genomic Medicine at CHI is in a central position to build on the foundations of the clinical genomics service in CHI at Crumlin to support clinical teams in understanding and managing disease through precision medicine. CHI are progressing the recruitment of a Genomics Medicine Lead (consultant) across CHI who will link and advise on a national strategy. </p><p>I fully support the development of a national strategy for Ireland, and I am pleased to advise that Dr Colm Henry, HSE Chief Clinical Officer, has recently set up an international group to review and advise on the national strategy for genomic medicine. This group will be reporting on its outcomes later this year and I look forward to hearing its progress.&rsquo; </p></reply>

It was concluded that the current Act does not present legal barriers for the approval of orphan drugs for reimbursement.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and clinical need.</p>  <p>  I am therefore satisfied that the criteria contained in the 2013 Act are fit for purpose and do not discriminate against the assessment of orphan drugs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of dedicated funding for new medicines has had a positive impact on the reimbursement of orphan drugs. The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021 enabled the HSE to approve 52 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines in 2021, 19 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the approval of new drugs. The HSE has approved 36 new medicines/new uses of existing medicines to date in 2022. At 30 April 2022 three of these were for the treatment of rare diseases. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.1332.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300110#WRW02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 487, 490, 492 and 495 together.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act is a clear, robust, statutory framework under which all new medicinal products must be assessed by the HSE. The HSE is the statutory decision-maker for the reimbursement of such products, and the Act ensures that these decisions are made on an objective and scientific basis.</p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to remove any threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) informed by the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) metric from the assessment of orphan medicinal products while retaining the responsibility for the HSE to consider cost-effectiveness under modified criteria.</p>  <p>  The QALY is the economic evaluation system which is used to set a threshold of cost-effectiveness when assessing medicines. Using the QALY, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) can systematically assess new medicines for cost effectiveness. Disregarding a validated systematic evidence-based scientific methodology to inform decision-making would greatly limit the HSE&rsquo;s capacity to determine whether the submitted price for orphan drugs represents value for money. In the absence of cost-effectiveness information on orphan drugs, the HSE would enter commercial negotiations in an uninformed, and therefore disadvantageous position.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not provide for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs. The statutory framework in the 2013 Act requires the HSE to take account of a range of objective factors and not just cost-effectiveness under the QALY system.  In making reimbursement decisions, there is a list of criteria contained in the Act which the HSE is required to consider, including the magnitude of the clinical effect, cost effectiveness, budget impact, available resources, and unmet medical need.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the QALY economic evaluation system does not restrict the HSE from applying discretion particularly in seeking to address unmet medical need. In making reimbursement decisions, the HSE often reimburses orphan medicines in excess of a cost per QALY of &euro;45,000 in cases where the potential to address unmet need is supported by robust clinical evidence.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and nineteen of the fifty-two new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the approval of new drugs. The HSE has approved 36 new medicines/new uses of existing medicines to date in 2022 including three medicines  for the treatment of rare diseases.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the concerns outlined above, the Bill is honourable in its intent and must serve as an opportunity to explore the policy options available to us. We all want an assessment process for orphan medicines which provides our most vulnerable patients with access to the innovative treatments which they deserve. The Bill represents an opportunity to comprehensively look at the current system and consider how issues such as transparency and communication can be improved, and I have asked my officials to do that.</p></reply>

The majority of new, innovative medicines are evaluated by the EMA and authorised via the European Commission&rsquo;s centralised procedure in order to be marketed in the EU.</p><p>The timing of company applications for reimbursement in different countries can vary for a number of reasons, not least the available market share in each country. Once a company responsible for the commercialisation of a new medicine receives market authorisation, it can apply for reimbursement in the country (or countries) of its choice. Ireland, by virtue of its size and market share, may not always be prioritised by a company in the first stages of marketing a new product.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, once a new medicine has received marketing authorisation, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have the product added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost-effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p><p>The final decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT). The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p><p>As outlined in the Framework Agreement with industry on the pricing and supply of medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving a company&rsquo;s pricing/reimbursement application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to approve a new medicine for reimbursement.</p><p>The HSE must ensure that the best possible price is achieved for new medicines as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments over several years. This can lead to protracted commercial negotiations.</p><p>The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. However, the allocation of dedicated funding for new medicines has had a positive impact on the reimbursement of orphan drugs.</p><p>The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021 enabled the HSE to approve 52 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines in 2021, 19 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30m for new medicines this year which will provide access to new innovative medicines for patients.</p></reply>

Companies insist that parts of the application are confidential.</p>  <p>  The NCPE publish a Technical Summary Document for each completed Health Technology Assessment (HTA), which provides an overview of the clinical and economic dossier reviewed by the NCPE, and the outcomes of the economic assessment.</p>  <p>  The NCPE&rsquo;s website is updated in real time in respect of all steps in the HTA process. Additionally, their dedicated online section for patients includes information on the submission process, the drug reimbursement process and how to interpret NCPE recommendations.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also confirmed that it faces significant challenges in publishing all of the information it uses in decision-making, as such information is also subjected to commercial confidentiality by the pharmaceutical companies.</p>  <p>  The NCPE&rsquo;s Patient Organisation Submission Process encourages consideration of the lived experience of patients, carers and their families, as well as their views on the difference a new medicine may make. This information is then used as part of the Health Technology Assessment of medicines undergoing evaluation.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act. The group also includes representation from the National Patient Forum.</p>  <p>  When considering applications, the HSE can request the input of the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC). The RDTRC gives a voice to rare disease patients and also to clinicians with expertise in the specific illnesses in question. Using the guidance from the Committee, the HSE is able to take account of the challenges faced by patients in terms of unmet need and the potential impact of the drug, alongside considerations of cost effectiveness.</p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.1364.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300111#WRX00600"><p>While the pricing of medicines is not considered to be fully unrelated to intellectual property rights, particularly in the context of monopoly suppliers, pricing determination remains a national competency.  The European Commission has developed an intellectual property rights framework to encourage and sustain innovation by the pharmaceutical industry in developing new medicinal products. For the case of medicines, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend patent protection for medicinal products whereby several years have passed while clinical trials were underway and in advance of receipt of a marketing authorisation. The framework ensures that a return on investment is achievable if a product makes it to market and ensures the continued investment by the pharmaceutical industry in the development of new and innovative medicinal products.   </p>  <p>  Specific to the setting of prices in Ireland, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 is the primary legislation that governs medicine pricing and reimbursement procedures and policies. Under the 2013 Act, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the power to set the relevant reimbursement prices for certain medicinal goods. Section 21(2) of the 2013 Act sets out the factors that the HSE must take into account when setting the relevant reimbursement prices proposed by the supplier of a medicine, which are as follows:</p>  <p>  (a) the equivalent relevant prices (if practically available) of each item in all other Member States where the item is marketed, (b) the relevant prices of therapeutically similar listed items, (c) the potential therapeutic benefits in each case, (d) the budget impact of each item, (e) the ability of suppliers to meet demand, (f) the resources available to the Executive, and, (g) any agreement on pricing in place with industry </p>  <p>  The HSE has also agreed and set out standard processes with industry in relation to the assessment of pricing and reimbursement applications for medicines. In that context, the 2021-2025 multiannual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and Medicines for Ireland (MFI) represent an important step in reducing the cost of medicines and improving access to innovative new medicines for patients.</p>  <p>  Although the use of the Health Act 2013 remains a viable option for the State in managing drug expenditure, it is accepted that there are wider benefits to maintaining a collaborative and cooperative approach with industry to the supply and pricing of medicines while the terms of such framework agreements continue to deliver for all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The new deals will deliver improved access for patients to new and innovative medicines, reductions in the cost of existing medicines and an easing of financial pressure on the health services into the future. It is estimated that this will result in the state paying between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million less for medicines than it would otherwise.</p>  <p>  As part of a pricing and reimbursement application for a new chemical entity, the manufacturer submits a price application form (PAF) for a medicine it wishes the HSE to include on its reimbursement list / for hospital pricing approval. Under the IPHA agreement, the price included in the PAF must be no more than the average price based on 14 nominated states. The states include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK). This is referred to as external reference pricing (ERP) whereby the price in a &lsquo;basket&rsquo; of reference countries is used to derive an acceptable price. </p>  <p>  For generic and biosimilars, reimbursement is automatically approved, provided the pricing is in line with the generic and biosimilar (and hybrid) pricing framework/agreement. The pricing of such medicines is linked to the price of the originator or patented medicine. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention. </p>  <p>  The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications. The purpose of challenging the pharmaceutical company pricing is to arrive at a position of value for money. In doing so, resources are used as effectively as possible to reimburse a wide range of medicines. </p></reply>

The resourcing of this work is kept under review to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s health interests are adequately promoted and represented within the EU and its institutions. Accordingly, with the agreement of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the staffing complement seconded from the Department of Health to the Permanent Representation in Brussels has increased at times of particular demand, such as during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union and also in response to increased workloads associated with the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Undoubtedly the health area has assumed a greater profile internationally since the experience of COVID-19 and officials in my Department will, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs as appropriate, give due consideration to any associated resourcing needs going forward.</p></reply>

However, Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run, and staff in these organisations are not public servants. Their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. </p>  <p>  Certain Section 39 organisations have achieved pay restoration in recent years. An agreement was reached at the WRC in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by 50 agencies only. Pay restoration commenced in April 2019 with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000.  Any outstanding balance was paid in 2020 and 2021. A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021, and the third and final payment due to be made in 2023.</p>  <p>  I am unable to advise you of projected costs for providing additional funding to Section 39 organisations. The previous pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. There is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that process has reached a final resolution. </p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE also has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e., in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care or are receiving end of life care.  In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.  Additionally, patients who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having  a prognosis of 24 months or less are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.</p>  <p>   With regard to the estimated cost of providing a medical card in the manner sought, this information is not readily available and it is, therefore, not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of the proposal.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p><p>Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p><p>Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p><p>With regard to the estimated cost of the deputy's proposals, the data required to model these are not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost or number of cards.</p><p>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

Among these temporary measures, I extended the Pandemic Placement Grant of &euro;100 per week to all eligible nursing and midwifery students on supernumerary placement to the end of the academic year 2021/22. Currently, HSE officials are working to make sure this grant is paid to any eligible students who have not yet received it. While this process is well underway, I am keen for it to be completed urgently and I have asked the HSE to prioritise this. </p>  <p>  I also announced additional support to nursing and midwifery students needing overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements. I doubled the cap on the vouched accommodation allowance to &euro;100 per week of placement.</p>  <p>  These additional supports arose following the Longer-Term Review of Matters relating to Student Nurses and Midwives. This independent review, conducted by Mr. Se&aacute;n McHugh at my request , set out a number of recommendations, including in relation to introducing an enhanced Travel and Subsistence scheme for students while attending their supernumerary clinical placements. My Department and I are considering these further so that an enhanced scheme can be put in place  for the forthcoming academic year that will provide a targeted and more equitable approach to supporting students in undertaking their supernumerary clinical placements. </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p><p>Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p><p>The additional cost to the State of adding Asthma as a condition to the LTI scheme (excluding sub-threshold &amp;amp; private patients) is c. &euro;17.3m. This costing is based on the latest available data from 2020.</p><p>This costing is subject to the following caveats:</p><p>- Excludes any potential impact Covid-19 will have on respiratory conditions.</p><p>- The costings may also have been impacted by a change is client behaviour in 2020/21 due to the Pandemic. </p><p>- Dispensing frequency is at 80% or pre Covid levels but costs on that 80% has increased by c. &euro;1.2m.</p><p>- Resetting back to pre Covid dispensing level the forecast additional cost reported above of &euro;17.3m would increase to in excess of &euro;17.6m.</p><p>In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p><p>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p><p>In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p><p>In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p><p>Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Both I and the Government have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services. The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS. </p><p>To help address this issue, I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish and an enhanced oral health examination. </p><p>I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings. </p><p>The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p><p>Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I hope that this substantial additional investment attracts more dentists to treat medical card patients.</p><p>These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy. The HSE will assist anyone still experiencing problems accessing a service under the Scheme.</p><p>I understand that contractors are looking for more substantive reform of the Scheme. It is my intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy, which sets out a body of substantial services reform.</p><p>Work is underway to design a governance framework to oversee and facilitate root and branch service reform. The Chief Dental Officer in my Department is already engaging with stakeholders on such reform and I understand that she will shortly be meeting with the Irish Dental Association.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: . Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.

Since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p><p>The Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) provides for the refund of the amount by which expenditure on approved prescribed medicines or medical and surgical appliances exceeds a named threshold in any calendar month. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.</p><p>On 1 January 2022, the DPS threshold was reduced to &euro;100 per month. On 1 March 2022, the DPS threshold was further reduced the DPS threshold to &euro;80. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. </p><p>The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations prescribed 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Prescription charges do not apply to persons who qualify for the LTI scheme.</p><p>A review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. The current priority has been on access to GP services and a review of hospital charges.</p><p>Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p><p>The abolition of prescription charges for persons with long-term medical dependency is not currently under consideration for Budget 2023. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-13a.1491.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071300113#WRAA03600"><p>I inform the Deputy that the Agriculture Appeals Office operates independently of the Department.  The Office has responsibility for agriculture appeals and in addition, the Office provides administrative and secretariat support to the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) which was established in February 2018.  In addition to their agriculture appeal functions, Appeals Officers are also appointed as members of the FAC. </p><p>A Review of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and operations at the Agriculture Appeals Office was completed in December 2017. </p><p>The report of the Review Committee included a recommendation that, where an appellant is not satisfied with the decision of an appeals officer, he or she can seek a review of that decision from an Independent Agriculture Appeals Review Panel.  </p><p>The Review Committee recommended that the panel should consist of an independent chairperson, the Director of the Agriculture Appeals Office and additional members with technical and practical expertise.</p><p>The recommendation for an independent Agriculture Appeals Review Panel is a key priority for the current Government. Indeed, the Programme for Government <i>Our Shared Future</i>(2020) includes a commitment to &ldquo;<i>establish an Independent Agriculture Appeals Review Panel in legislation, as a priority, and ensure that the panel includes participants with practical knowledge and experience of farming</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>This, and other recommendations contained in the Review, will require a change to primary legislation prior to implementation.  Work is ongoing to implement this and other recommendations contained in the Review report and I have met with both the Director and Deputy Director of the Agriculture Appeals Office in this regard. Their work on the entirety of the Review recommendations has been extensive and has included consultations with relevant stakeholders including the farming representative bodies.</p><p>Recommendations of the Review that are already in place include:  the appointment of a Deputy Director, bespoke legal training for Appeals Officers, engagement with the farm bodies involved in the Farmer&rsquo;s Charter of Rights Monitoring Committee, formal induction training for newly appointed Appeals Officers, the publishing of a Code of Practice for Appeals Officers, the holding of case conferences, and the holding of remote oral hearings for appellants. </p><p>During 2021, engagement took place with relevant stakeholders, including representative bodies, regarding implementing the recommendations and establishing the Independent Review Panel and work is progressing on the required amendments to legislation. </p><p>The Agriculture Appeals Office has set itself a target of three months for closure of an appeal from the time of receipt of the Department file documents.  Certain circumstances may result in appeals not being completed within that target time frame. In addition to the impact of COVID-19 and Forestry Appeals commitments, the reasons for appeals being closed outside the three month period varies and can include delays in agreeing dates for oral hearings with all parties, the complexity of cases, legal issues, time taken by appellants and/or the Department to revert with additional information requested, and resource capacity.  </p><p>I have been informed that during 2021, there was an increased demand on resources due to the backlog of Forestry appeals, which I am informed has since been resolved.  COVID restrictions also contributed to delays, as oral hearings could not be held during certain periods within the year, and a high level of postponements at short notice due to close contacts and other COVID-related matters.</p><p>I have been assured that the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently working on reducing the number of open appeals on hand and reducing the time period from the assignment of an appeal to an Appeals Officer to the closing of that appeal and has made significant progress in this regard in 2022 to date. In addition, I have been advised that the records of the Agriculture Appeals Office indicate the number of appeals received had increased from 570 in 2019 to 760 in 2020 and to 809 in 2021.  Also, the number of forestry appeals had increased in 2019 and 2020. Both of these factors had a negative impact on the time taken to resolve appeals. I am now informed that the number of agriculture appeals received to the end of Quarter 2 this year was 325 and during that same period 489 appeals were closed and the time taken to resolve appeals is reducing in line with these trends.  </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: . </p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 8 July, 68,943<b></b>eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 20,000 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 88,943.</p><p>All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment. As eligibility is still being assessed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with an estimated number of public service workers who are eligible to receive the payment but have yet to be paid. </p><p>I assure you that it is the intention of the Department to have all eligible healthcare workers paid without delay, and all possible efforts are being made to achieve this.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the carbon footprint measurement is to enable the quantification of all of the environmentally sustainable activity carried out by Irish farmers. </p>  <p>  The SBLAS sustainability audit, including the Carbon Footprint measurement, is developed on an internationally verified quality assurance model.  There is no direct cost to the farmer for participation in the SBLAS, as the costs of the audits are funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the carbon footprint measurement is both an eligibility requirement and an integral element of the proposed Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme under the new CAP.  In designing the scheme, in consultation with farming stakeholders, the Department gave detailed consideration to all aspects of the scheme design including potential mechanisms for delivery of the carbon foot-printing requirement.  I am satisfied that the chosen scheme design is the most appropriate.</p></reply>

The scheme closed for applications on Monday 11th July.</p>  <p>  A key condition of the scheme is to reduce breeding pig numbers by 10% as compared to the National Pig Census 2021 return and maintain that reduction for four subsequent and consecutive months.  The objective of the reduction measure is to incentivise pig farmers to reduce their number of breeding sows in order to reduce their overall feed costs, and to contribute to food security by aiming to protect the viability of pig farmers. It also supports farmers who participate in animal health and husbandry measures which are seen as key drivers in productivity and feed efficiency. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this condition is therefore a necessary requirement of this voluntary scheme.</p></reply>

For instance, my Department commissioned a digital recording of all our schemes and services to assist a customer with reading difficulties, supplied documents in Braille to assist a visually impaired customer and provided Irish Sign Language interpretation services for onsite meetings with our customers when requested.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) fosters awareness of equality and disability issues among staff and provides support, advice and guidance to both staff and managers around reasonable accommodation requests to ensure employees with a disability have equal opportunities throughout their career in my Department.</p><p>We frequently engage with the National Disability Authority regarding policies relevant to persons with disabilities.</p><p>My Department is represented on a range on interdepartmental committees of relevance to the representation of people with disabilities. These include:</p><p>- Working Group on the development of a Well-being Framework for Ireland</p><p>- Oireachtas Disability Group</p><p>- Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights</p><p>- Interdepartmental Committee on access to services by &lsquo;off-line&rsquo; citizens</p><p>My Department supports the AHEAD (Association for Higher Education and Disability) Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme which aims to promote access to the workplace for graduates with disabilities. During 2021 my Department facilitated four paid and mentored placements under the WAM programme for suitably qualified candidates. Many former WAM participants have gone on to secure permanent employment. It is planned to facilitate further placements on this programme during 2022.</p><p>The Oireachtas Work Learning Programme (OWL), which was launched by the Ceann Comhairle in September 2018 is an unpaid applied learning, development and socialisation programme for young adults with an intellectual disability.  The Programme aims to support individuals in developing the skills and confidence which will lead them to access paid employment in the open labour market.  My Department collaborated with the Houses of the Oireachtas in facilitating three trainee placements on the 2019/20 programme. Many graduates of this programme have now gone on to secure permanent employment in the Public sector and one of the graduates recently joined my Department in a permanent post.  </p><p>The move of my Department&rsquo;s website to the www.gov.ie portal enabled the redesign of this platform to comply with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and National Disability Authority (NDA) guidelines. This includes ensuring that content on the website is at a suitable reading comprehension level.</p><p>As regards the 12 State Bodies under the aegis of my Department, the information requested is an operational matter for the State Bodies themselves. I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Agencies and have requested that a response should issue within 10 days.</p></reply>

As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the LIS is funded into the future. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.</p><p>The scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  From 2017 to 2021, my Department has allocated funding towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p><p>Last year, I was in a position to double the initial LIS allocation to &euro;21 million following the identification of savings in other capital areas. I was pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year bringing the total allocation since 2017 to over &euro;90 million. This year, I am continuing to closely monitor expenditure patterns. Should savings emerge, I will give consideration to again allocating additional funding to the scheme.</p><p>The table below sets out the allocations to each county since the scheme was reintroduced

To date, 191 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;278 million for projects costing &euro;377 million.</p><p>Calls for applications to the Fund are sought under two categories &ndash; Category 1 and Category 2. Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed. Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for Category 1 applications</p><p>The fourth call for Category 1 applications to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed on the 29<sup>th</sup>April 2022.  My Department received 42 applications to this call, together seeking funding of over &euro;149 million. I understand that an application was received from Clare County Council for the project referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The application process for the Fund is competitive in nature. Applications are currently being assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department will prepare a report setting out recommended projects. My role as Minister will be to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding.  </p><p>I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming months.</p></reply>

Rather, other issues such as the centrality of communities were cited more strongly as being key to sustainable and inclusive development of rural areas. Our Rural Future was developed accordingly, to prioritise investment in the facilities and infrastructure required to support those communities to maximise their potential.</p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage that there are currently no plans to re-introduce Town Councils. However, in line the with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government, the Minister has signalled his intent to consider the introduction of further measures to strengthen the system of municipal districts.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, my Department will continue to invest significantly in rural towns and villages, through programmes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, each of which provide funding to support the development of rural towns and communities as more attractive places to live, work and raise a family.</p></reply>

Public Participation Networks (PPNs) have been established in all local authority areas. Membership of a PPN is open to all volunteer-led/not-for-profit groups in each local authority area. They bring together volunteer-led groups in each area to represent the Community and Voluntary, Environment, and Social Inclusion sectors. Over 18,000 groups nationwide are currently members of a PPN.</p>  <p>  The PPN is the main link through which the local authority connects with the local community sector within its area. Its primary function is to provide representation for the community sector in Local Authority policymaking structures, giving local volunteers a greater say in local government decisions which affect their own communities. Where community representation is required on local authority committees, such as Strategic Policy Committees or Local Community Development Committees, etc., it must be sourced through the PPN.</p>  <p>  A &lsquo;root and branch&rsquo; review of PPN structures was commissioned by the Department of Rural And Community Development and conducted by an independent contractor, Mazars, in 2021. Fulfilling a commitment in the Programme for Government, the report on the independent review was published last month, and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The Department will now work with stakeholders to develop an implementation roadmap to guide any changes to Public Participation Network structures. Participatory and co-design processes will be used to prioritise recommendations based on stakeholder input, and to ensure a diverse range of views and representatives are involved. </p>  <p>  The total funding allocated to the Department of Rural and Community Development to fund PPNs and progress initiatives in this area in 2022 is &euro;2,450,000.  The question of additional funding will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2023.  </p></reply>
