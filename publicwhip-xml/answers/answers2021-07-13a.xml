This is the largest single increase in recent memory and will make a real difference to our critical care staff, who have done extraordinary work under extreme pressure throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;52m to the implementation of this Strategic Plan. This will retain permanently the 40 beds provided in 2020 and will add further new build capacity to bring baseline permanent capacity to 321 beds by year end. This funding also allows for workforce planning and education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that 42 of the 66 beds funded for 2021 are now permanently open, bringing the national baseline to 297. The number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors. The HSE has further advised that the number of staff associated with these beds is of the order of 400. Recruitment and capital works are ongoing to open the remaining beds as soon as possible. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

In that regard, the Government is committed to the development of the new National Maternity Hospital planned for the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements were set out in the Mulvey Agreement. This Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company &ndash; National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. The draft legal framework that has been developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements.</p>  <p>  While, as stated previously, my preferred option would be that the site for the new hospital was owned by the State, under the draft legal framework the State would lease the site from St Vincent&rsquo;s for 99 years, with scope for a further 50-year renewal. </p>  <p>  However, I will not bring any proposal to Government unless it provides the necessary assurances in relation to, firstly, ensuring that all legally permissible services are provided at the new hospital and, secondly, protection of the State&rsquo;s investment.</p>  <p>  In that context, there will be further engagement with all stakeholders in relation to this project, as we move toward the finalisation of the legal arrangements. However, I will not be making any further comment on the nature of this engagement until it concludes.</p></reply>

The health supports include counselling services, physiotherapy and a discretionary medical card. </p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The HSE has advised that, as of 8 July 2021, a formal application for pricing and reimbursement with respect to Solriamfetol (Sunosi) has not been received. If the marketing authorisation holder chooses to submit a pricing/reimbursement application for this medicine, it will be processed by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of over &euro;2 billion annually and continue to make new and innovative treatment available to patients. The additional funding of &euro;50m provided for new medicines in Budget 2021 has enabled the HSE to approve 29 new drugs for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  I am also pleased to advise that the drug Patisiran (Onpattro) to treat hATTR Amyloidosis, has also been approved for reimbursement upon commencement of a Managed Access Programme, currently under development by the HSE. </p></reply>

This includes a cross-party Oireachtas Committee, and a group of Civil Society organisations brought together by the NWCI. I will also be meeting with clinicians providing services.

In 2021 an additional investment of &euro;150 million has been made available to fund over 24.2 million hours of home support. This is 5 million hours more than the 2020 target and represents an unprecedented level of investment and a substantial increase in service provision.</p><p>Due to the effects of the cyberattack the most recent complete data available represents the period to the end of March 2021.  As of this date there were 54,112 people in receipt of home support and almost 4.7 million hours had been delivered across the country.</p><p>In Longford and Westmeath, the HSE had provided almost 130,000 hours which was about 25,000 more hours compared to March 2020.  There were 1,317 people receiving the service and there was nobody waiting for approval of funding for a new or additional service.</p><p>In Mayo over 160,000 hours were provided which represented an increase of about 15,800 hours compared to the same period in 2020.  There were 2,070 people in receipt of home support hours and there were 50 people waiting for approval of funding for new or additional service.</p><p>In Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal the HSE had provided almost 338,000 hours which represented an increase of 48,000 hours compared with March 2020.  At the time there were 3,111 people in receipt of these hours and 131 people were waiting for funding approval. </p><p>Enabling people with care-needs to continue to live independently at home for as long as possible is a priority for the Government. To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.  </p></reply>

Scientific and clinical evidence is evolving on the long-term effects of COVID-19. An increasing number of reports and studies are now being published on the topic, however, at present there is no agreement on the definition or the terminology.</p>  <p>  We do however, know that the clinical course of viral illnesses varies between people, and that the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in some people for many weeks. However, this does not mean that people are infectious for a prolonged period of time. </p>  <p>  People who have had Covid-19 are being followed up by their GP or in hospital settings. People in the community who are concerned about persistent Covid-19 symptoms should contact their GP. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.</p>  <p>  Specific guidance on the treatment of Long Covid is presently under development both here and internationally. </p>  <p>  The HSE is assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID. I can advise the Deputy that the HSE as part of its work on post-Covid care, is now looking at how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has been in touch with and will be engaging with a group of people who are suffering post-Covid symptoms to inform understanding. Guidance is being developed to align needs with care provision and to develop criteria and strategies for the ongoing evaluation of patients.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of Long Covid to inform policy as appropriate.</p></reply>

However, a number of legal issues were identified which necessitated further consideration.  </p><p>Since services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019, there has been a limited number of reports of protests or other actions relating to termination of pregnancy.  This is an extremely positive development. It suggests that these services have bedded in relatively smoothly to date and are becoming a normal part of the Irish healthcare system, as intended.</p><p>Where problems do arise with protests outside healthcare services, there is existing public order legislation in place to protect people accessing services, staff and local residents.  </p><p>The Department of Health has liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on safe access to services. The Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda Stations raising awareness about the issue. It directed that any protests be monitored, and breaches of existing law dealt with. The Department has provided information on existing public order and other relevant legislation to the HSE for appropriate distribution.</p><p>Termination of pregnancy services have continued to function during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is regular ongoing engagement between my Department and the HSE to facilitate the smooth-running of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise. </p></reply>

Section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 provides for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take a person into Garda custody if the Garda believes the person is suffering from a mental disorder.</p>  <p>  The Commission highlighted that there had been an increase in the use of Section 12. While the cause of this increase is not known, the Department is generally in favour of the limited use of Section 12 to detain people because being taken into Garda custody can have a traumatising effect on people. The HSE has requested clarity from the Commission on the number of applications made by Garda&iacute;, particularly a breakdown between the use of Section 9 and Section 12.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will understand, the proportion of applications for involuntary detention reflects the unfortunate reality that Garda&iacute; often encounter persons with severe mental health issues and will be called upon by members of the public or indeed family members where a person is experiencing high levels of distress.  Very often, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the first available frontline service to whom people will turn in such situations.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently finalising a draft general scheme to significantly amend the Mental Health Act 2001, including proposed changes to the admission process and an updated criteria for detention.  Work on updating the Mental Health Act has been in development for the last number of years. The draft general scheme is generally in line with the recommendations of a 2015 Expert Group review of the Act. This Expert Group made 165 recommendations on a range of different issues/sections of the legislation, including a change to Section 12, with a greater role for Authorised Officers. The Expert Group recommended that, in future, Authorised Officers should be the only group allowed to make an application for involuntary detention under Section 9 of the Act, and in cases where a person is taken into Garda custody under Section 12, an Authorised Officer would have to be contacted immediately to assess whether or not an application for involuntary detention should be made. These have been taken into account during the finalisation of the draft heads.</p>  <p>  In addition to these recommendations, the Department has carried out extensive consultation over the past few years, including a recent public consultation which received 100 submissions, and extensive engagement with key stakeholders such as the HSE and the Mental Health Commission. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme was approved by Cabinet today and will be published this month. The bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Attorney General with a view to introducing the legislation to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Justice established a High Level Cross-Departmental and Cross Agency Task Force, which brings together senior officials from the Department of Justice, the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Health and the HSE, the Central Mental Hospital, the Department of Housing and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This Task Force is a commitment in the Programme for Government and is considering the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care supports on release.  It is chaired by Ms Kathleen Lynch, former Minister of State with responsibility for Primary Care, Mental Health and Disability. The group has established a number of sub-groups which are focusing in the first instance on effective diversion from the criminal justice system; along with capacity levels in the Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service; and also at community care and through-care from custody.   </p>  <p>  Applications for involuntary detention are never made lightly and applications made by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take full account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&lsquo;s obligation to protect the human rights and welfare of individuals and communities. The only statutory option available to Garda&iacute; responding to people in a mental health crisis and potentially posing a risk of harm to themselves or others is to invoke Section 12 of the Mental Health Act, 2001.  Section 12 requires Garda&iacute; to take the person into custody in order to have them assessed by a registered medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has confirmed that all trainee Garda&iacute; are trained over two days in an internationally recognised Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) workshop which is delivered in collaboration with the HSE.  This workshop is a suicide first aid programme which equips trainee Garda&iacute; with the necessary skills to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce immediate risk of suicide if necessary. Trainee Garda&iacute; also study the Mental Health Act 2001 and the procedures that are required if they have to invoke their powers.</p>  <p>  As part of the Continuous Professional Development core programme for operational members, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided training on awareness of mental health difficulties in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001. The programme also covers types of mental health difficulties, Garda powers and procedures, and the transportation of people in mental health crisis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland concluded that societal issues such as the mental health of individuals should not be the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone and the Commission recommended the establishment of multi-agency teams that would include Garda&iacute; to respond to the needs of individuals with mental health issues.  A pilot crisis intervention team is being developed in the Limerick Garda Division. This pilot is being progressed in close collaboration with the HSE and it is hoped to begin the rollout of the pilot team early next year.</p></reply>

The HSE and the Department continue to plan for any surge in demand for mental health services and supports as it arises. The HSE have service surge capacity plans in place, including access to acute beds in the private sector.</p>  <p>  The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service needs, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. In 2020, an additional &euro;2.2 million was allocated to develop telehealth and psychosocial responses to Covid-19. Telehealth services are now fully established while the HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, provides a cohesive, coordinated, consistent and collaborative whole-of-population approach to the provision of mental health services and supports.</p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;50 million for mental health services in 2021, bringing the annual budget to in excess of &euro;1.1 billion. &euro;23 million of this additional funding is dedicated to commencing implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision while &euro;15M is allocated to address additional challenges posed by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  More generally, further developments in mental health services continue in line with the national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision and commitments set out in the HSE National Service Plan 2021. The &euro;23 million allocated to the implementation of Sharing the Vision is funding enhanced resources for community mental health teams, CAMHS hubs/teams, adult crisis resolution services, increased supports in employment, peer support workers, bereavement co-ordination, and dialectical behaviour therapy. Work is progressing in these areas, including the recruitment of the 153 new mental health staff this year.</p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recommends the continued phased implementation and evaluation of existing national clinical programmes in mental health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in Psychosis, and Eating Disorders. The clinical programmes, which are in various stages of design and implementation, are at the heart of service improvement. </p>  <p>   Additionally, out of hours crisis supports will be enhanced in line with Sharing the Vision and commitments set out in the HSE National Service Plan 2021.  Funding has been allocated in 2021 for crisis resolution teams, crisis  or community cafes, and CAMHS telehealth hubs.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to improving its infrastructure, including new or improved community-based facilities and services for people with more severe and enduring mental health difficulties. Of the additional funding provided in 2021, &euro;7m will fund reconfiguration of mental health facilities, in line with Mental Health Commission and  Covid-19 related risk assessment recommendations. This, plus the recurring &euro;6m in new development funding, means there is &euro;13 million for minor works and refurbishments in 2021.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in 2020, the Government Covid-19 Stability Fund provided &euro;45 million to community organisations providing services, including social care. An additional &euro;10 million was provided in 2021. The fund is managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development, and Pobal are administering partners. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced additional funding for mental health for proposed cross-governmental and inter-agency initiatives to meet evolving demands for mental health arising from Covid-19, including those relating to young people. This will cover, for example, promoting positive mental health, increasing awareness of the wide range of supports available, and improving signposting to these service and supports. The Department of Health is at present progressing the details of this new initiative, including consultation with other relevant stakeholders in the health and education sectors.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I, along with the Government as a whole, remain fully committed to enhancing the provision of mental health services nationally.   </p></reply>

My Department will also continue to liaise with colleagues in other Departments where the issues intersect.</p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is the key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland.</p><p>The current Guidelines state:There are currently four COVID-19 Vaccines authorised for use in Ireland. The vaccines are not interchangeable. For vaccines that have a two-dose schedule, the same vaccine should be used for both doses.

This comprehensive piece of legislation will encompass the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a very wide range of practices, including domestic altruistic surrogacy.  </p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority, the establishment of which the Bill will provide for. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). </p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child. Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed. However, commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.</p>  <p>  Another important requirement for domestic surrogacy will be that the details of the surrogate, the intending parent(s) and any relevant donor will be recorded on the National Surrogacy Register, which will be established by the AHR Regulatory Authority. This will ensure that all children born through surrogacy will be able to access accurate and comprehensive information on their genetic and gestational origins.  </p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. As issues relating to international surrogacy concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments, my Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of this policy area. </p>  <p>  Overall, the aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR &ndash; including the protection of their identity rights &ndash; is the key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

The attack had the impact of removing access to most patient and care systems as well as the central business systems of the HSE. Over the last weeks many of these systems have been recovered and services have recommenced. There was a priority focus on key systems in the hospital and community areas with a view to resuming vita services. Some of the key areas recovered included, radiotherapy, laboratory, imaging, pharmacy, mental health systems, email and patient administration systems.</p>  <p>  At present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and indeed loss of records at a time when the HSE was working mostly on paper based processes. There are still la number of areas of ongoing concern including endoscopy in some locations, sterile supplies, stroke telemedicine email still has issues while the systems themselves are back.</p>  <p>  The impact of the attack on services has been to increase risk associated with the absence of systems or the use of manual processes, the loss of some services such as endoscopy, radiotherapy and scheduled care including community therapies. The position now is that most services have returned and have begun to catch up on patients / service users that were delayed. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak of Jan/Feb 2021 so Conti has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services.</p>  <p>  As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE. However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems.

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE, has implemented an antigen testing programme in food processing facilities, supplementing the PCR serial testing programme there. These tests are being carried out under clinical governance arrangements put in place by the Department of Agriculture. A further rapid testing pilot scheme began on June 14th in four universities including NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, UCD, and UCC. Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in other education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently published the report of the Antigen Test Validation Project which validated a number of rapid antigen detection tests (ADTS) intended for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The products evaluated were chosen as those expected to represent the best available products based on the manufacturers claims and other available evidence. The recommendations in this report will assist in the consideration of any other potential applications of rapid antigen detection tests to support the overall national testing strategy. </p>  <p>  I have established an Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Testing which will be chaired by Professor Mary Horgan, to support and advise Government departments who are responsible for progressing pilots and the rollout of rapid tests to their respective sectors.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which had a significant impact on acute hospitals.  </p><p>The HSE has been working since 14th May last to recover the effects of the cyber attack on its systems. The HSE advise that at present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and there are still a number of areas of ongoing concern. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak in the first quarter of this year and the ransomware attack has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services. My Department  does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13th May 2021</p><p>At the 13th of May 2021, nationwide there were 76,510 patients waiting for an adult or child IPDC procedure, a reduction of 13% (-11,085) compared to the same period last year. At the 13th May 2021 there were 630,270 waiting for a first outpatient appointment across all hospital groups, an increase of 10% (+59, 620) compared to the same period last year.</p><p>Specifically in relation to the Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore, at the 13th of May 2021, there were 1,279 patients waiting for an adult or child IPDC procedure, a reduction of 40% (-851) compared to the same period last year. At the 13th May 2021 there were 19,336 waiting for a first outpatient appointment at the Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore an increase of 4% (+811) compared to the same period last year.</p><p>The NTPF have advised my Department that they have approved Outpatient and Inpatient-Daycase insourcing initiatives so far in 2021 for the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore, which will facilitate treatment for 2,431 patients on waiting lists. Details of these initiatives are outlined in the attached document.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>NTPF Insourcing Approved OPD Proposals 2021 Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore <table>    <tr>       <th>Specialty</th>       <th>Initiative Type</th>       <th>Volume</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orthopaedics </td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vascular</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nephrology</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Medicine</td>       <td>OPD See &amp;amp; Treat</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Endoscopy</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>325</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1,525</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>NTPF Insourcing Approved IPDC Proposals 2021 Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore <table>    <tr>       <th>Specialty</th>       <th>Initiative Type</th>       <th>Volume</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Surgery</td>       <td>IPDC</td>       <td>55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ENT</td>       <td>IPDC</td>       <td>492</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orthopaedics </td>       <td>IPDC</td>       <td>359</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>906</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Inpatient - Daycase (IPDC), numbers waiting by time-band (months), Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore as at 13/05/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time-bands</th>       <th>0-6 Mths</th>       <th>6-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-18 Mths</th>       <th>18 + Mths</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Adult</td>       <td>814</td>       <td>121</td>       <td>97</td>       <td>184</td>       <td>1,216</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>63</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>874</td>       <td>124</td>       <td>97</td>       <td>184</td>       <td>1,279</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Outpatient (OPD), numbers waiting by time-band (months), Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore as at 13/05/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time-bands</th>       <th>0-6 Mths</th>       <th>6-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-18 Mths</th>       <th>18 + Mths</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Adult </td>       <td>4,868</td>       <td>3,376</td>       <td>2,283</td>       <td>6,023</td>       <td>16,550</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child </td>       <td>557</td>       <td>379</td>       <td>492</td>       <td>1,357</td>       <td>2,786</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>5,425</td>       <td>3,755</td>       <td>2,775</td>       <td>7,380</td>       <td>19,336</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It was advised, that treatment with cannabis be only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with the following medical conditions which have failed to respond to standard treatments;</p><p>spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis; </p><p>intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; </p><p>severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy. </p><p>Subsequently the Minister for Health established an Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of a Medical Cannabis Access Programme. This Group developed detailed Clinical Guidelines for the MCAP to be followed by clinicians, which contained inter alia guidance on  ingredient combinations that are recommended for each of the three indications included in the MCAP</p><p>The Medicinal Cannabis Access programme (MCAP) is a 5-year pilot programme. The purpose of the programme is to facilitate access to acceptable cannabis-based products for medical use that are of a standardised quality and which meet the requirements outlined in the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019 (as amended). </p><p>There are currently 4 products assessed by the HPRA for inclusion in Schedule 1 of the Regulations, more products are currently being assessed by the HPRA.</p><p>Reimbursement of the products, prescribed by approved medical consultants and supplied through community pharmacies for a specified therapeutic indication in line with Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019 (as amended) will be on an individual named patient basis aligned to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility under the community drug schemes (Medical Card, Long Term Illness Scheme and Drugs Payment Scheme). It cannot be assumed that reimbursement approval will be forthcoming on submission of applications. A reimbursement decision will be communicated with the prescribing consultant in writing.</p><p>The HSE have indicated that the MCAP will be operational this month.</p><p><b>Bedrocan</b></p><p>The products you refer to are manufactured by the dispensing pharmacy in the Netherlands. Owing to Dutch government restrictions cannabis-based oils may not be commercially exported to pharmacies or wholesalers however they will allow the filling of individual prescriptions for collection by the patient, the patient&rsquo;s family or a representative. </p><p>Representations were made to the Dutch authorities about having the products exported to Ireland to facilitate their inclusion in the Access Programme if the producers wished to do so. The Dutch authorities replied that magistral preparations may only be provided directly to patients or their representative on the basis of a prescription, presented for dispensing.</p><p>Since April 2020, owing to the pandemic the Department has been collecting patient&rsquo;s prescriptions from the Netherlands and delivering them to patient&rsquo;s homes. These collections approximately every four weeks and will continue post-pandemic. </p><p>As a result of the prohibition of commercial export of the cannabis-based products the manufacturers cannot apply to the Health Products Regulatory Authority to have the products included in the Medical Cannabis Access Programme. However patient's can continue be treated with these products if their clinicians have a Ministerial licence issued under the Misuse of Drugs Act to do so. </p></reply>

The syndrome involves an unusual combination of thrombosis (blood clots) with thrombocytopenia (abnormally low level of the components that help blood to clot, known as platelets). Vaccine recipients are reminded to seek medical attention if they experience any of the following signs and symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain, persistent abdominal pain post vaccination, severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, confusion, seizures (fits) or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days.</p>  <p>  In its most recent Safety Update, the Health Products Regulatory Authority noted that, as of 9th June, it had received seven reports that are suspected cases of TTS, and which describe the unusual combination of blood clotting in combination with low platelets. In relation to these suspected TTS cases, symptoms occurred approximately 1-3 weeks from vaccination with the first dose of Vaxzevria.  Based on information available at the time, the individuals were either discharged or recovering in hospital after receiving specialist medical care.</p>  <p>  As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

At a national level, as of July 2020, there were 1,033 applications for a residential placement, of which 92.7% related to applications from adults, while 6.3% related to children.  </p>  <p>  In relation to CHO 2,  there were 110 applications for a residential placement, as of July 2020.  It is important to note that these figures represent a "point in time" analysis and may not include applications which were received by the CHO, but not yet processed using the DSMAT tool. </p>  <p>  The allocation of residential placements is determined on the basis of presenting need and/or associated risk factors.  Each CHO continues to actively manage applications for support from service users with high levels of acuity/ safeguarding risks, through lower-cost non-residential interventions such as in-home and Residential Respite, active case-management and inter-agency cooperation.</p>  <p>  This year, the Government provided an additional &euro;100 million in the 2021 Budget for new disability developments. This includes &euro;15m earmarked for 102 additional residential placements, with a focus on increasing capacity within residential services in a planned way and continuing to respond to the need for crisis residential placements.  Within the allocation of &euro;100m, additional funding has also been provided to increase the availability of intensive support packages to enable people with a disability and complex needs to remain living at home for longer. </p></reply>

It was advised, that treatment with cannabis be only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with the following medical conditions which have failed to respond to standard treatments;</p>  <p> spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis; </p>  <p> intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; </p>  <p> severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy. </p>  <p>  Subsequently the Minister for Health established an Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of a Medical Cannabis Access Programme. This Group developed detailed Clinical Guidelines for the MCAP to be followed by clinicians, which contained inter alia guidance on  ingredient combinations that are recommended for each of the three indications included in the MCAP</p>  <p>  The Medicinal Cannabis Access programme (MCAP) is a 5-year pilot programme. The purpose of the programme is to facilitate access to acceptable cannabis-based products for medical use that are of a standardised quality and which meet the requirements outlined in the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019 (as amended). </p>  <p>  There are currently 4 products assessed by the HPRA for inclusion in Schedule 1 of the Regulations, more products are currently being assessed by the HPRA.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement of the products, prescribed by approved medical consultants and supplied through community pharmacies for a specified therapeutic indication in line with Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019 (as amended) will be on an individual named patient basis aligned to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility under the community drug schemes (Medical Card, Long Term Illness Scheme and Drugs Payment Scheme). It cannot be assumed that reimbursement approval will be forthcoming on submission of applications. A reimbursement decision will be communicated with the prescribing consultant in writing.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the operation of  the MCAP. The MCAP was included in the HSE Service Plan 2021  and the HSE has indicated that it is expected to commence shortly.  </p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which had a significant impact on acute hospitals.  </p><p>The HSE has been working since 14th May last to recover the effects of the cyber attack on its systems. The HSE advise that at present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and there are still a number of areas of ongoing concern. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak in the first quarter of this year and the ransomware attack has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services. My Department  does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13th May 2021. The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons on the waiting list for elective surgery in County Mayo is outlined in the attached document. <table>    <tr>       <th>Row Labels </th>       <th>0-6 Mths </th>       <th>6-12 Mths </th>       <th>12-18 Mths </th>       <th>18+ Mths </th>       <th>Grand Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cardiology </td>       <td>166</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>244</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cardio-Thoracic Surgery </td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dermatology </td>       <td>6</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gastro-Enterology </td>       <td>52</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Medicine </td>       <td>290</td>       <td>187</td>       <td>200</td>       <td>  223</td>       <td>900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Surgery </td>       <td>173</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>390</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gynaecology </td>       <td>180</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>  129</td>       <td>417</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Neurology </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ophthalmology </td>       <td>129</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>215</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oral Surgery </td>       <td>21</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orthopaedics </td>       <td>254</td>       <td>123</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>  177</td>       <td>635</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Otolaryngology (ENT) </td>       <td>44</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>102</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paed Cardiology </td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paed Orthopaedic </td>       <td>12</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Respiratory Medicine </td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Surgery </td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Urology </td>       <td>7</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pain Relief </td>       <td>32</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>54</td>       <td>146</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Plastic Surgery </td>       <td>121</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>267</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Respiratory Medicine </td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>9</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rheumatology </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>9</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Small Vol Specialty </td>       <td>20</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Urology </td>       <td>210</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>357</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vascular Surgery </td>       <td>8</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total </td>       <td>1,758</td>       <td>790</td>       <td>621</td>       <td>  865</td>       <td>4,034</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the COVID-19 NPHET actively monitors the epidemiological situation and provides advice to Government in relation to the application of public health measures. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Ireland has taken a public health-led, whole-of-society approach to managing the pandemic. Ongoing consideration is being given to current and future measures and approaches for managing the response to COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  The level of public health restrictions is kept under review by Government. While significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme and the position had been broadly stable over the earlier part of June, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant is rapidly increasing in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully vaccinated. For this reason, a number of higher risk indoor activities did not recommence as planned on 5 July, pending the implementation of a system to verify vaccination or immunity status.  </p>  <p>  Our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and phased, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. Significant and sustained progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.   </p></reply>

Since then, it has informed Departments&rsquo; and Agencies&rsquo; work in respect of sectoral guidance and public information regarding ventilation. </p><p>The Expert Group submitted two reports while reporting to the NPHET at the Department of Health, which were duly considered by the HPSC and HSE-AMRIC in the context of updating its guidance. These reports, along with relevant agendas and meeting minutes are available on the gov.ie website: www.gov.ie/en/publication/aa43c-expert-group-on-the-role-of-ventilation-in-reducing-transmission-of-covid-19/#reports.</p><p>It is the responsibility of individual Government departments to provide sector-specific COVID-19 advice on ventilation as per their respective remits.

The total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics (RACs) in 2020 (44,233) amounted to 88% of the 2019 figure (50,249). GP e-referrals to RACs for weeks 2-17 (up to 25th April) this year were 153% of the activity in the corresponding weeks in 2020, and 126% for the corresponding weeks in 2019.</p>  <p>  Medical and radiation and oncology services continued throughout the pandemic, utilising the safeguards of social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures built up over the past year.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy up to end-2020 was at approximately 88% of 2019 activity, while radiation oncology was operating at >90% of 2019 activity. </p>  <p>  Urgent surgery was prioritised and there was an emphasis on maintaining safe patient pathways in this regard. Surgery numbers up to end-2020 were at 76% of the 2019 levels. This figure does not include surgeries involving public patients that were undertaken in private hospitals, so the overall figure is higher. </p>  <p>  While the recent ransomware attack has had an impact on cancer services, every effort is being made to maintain services at present, with a particular focus on urgent and time-sensitive cases. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;12m was allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding is supporting hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It is also supporting virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and is facilitating infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across Rapid Access Clinics and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p>  <p>In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. This funding will facilitate developments across prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports.  </p></reply>

To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. </p><p>2.

As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been completed and approved for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. </p><p>The Preliminary Business Case (PBC), in accordance with the Public Spending Code, is also under preparation. As part of the PBC process, the Elective Hospitals Oversight Group made a public call for site submissions from members of the public, the HSE, Land Development Agency and Hospital Groups. The closing date for this call was 4 June. Sites submitted are undergoing evaluation to examine their suitability, including a multi-criteria assessment and cost effectiveness assessment with a view to the Preliminary Business Case recommending a single preferred site option in each of the three locations.  Only those sites submitted as part of the call for submissions and which were compliant with the requirements of the call are under consideration. </p><p>The site identification process in Cork and Galway has been fully informed by discussions with the South South-West Hospital Group. The site identification exercise sought submissions of sites sufficiently large to cater for future development needs in Cork, including new and replacement inpatient and outpatient facilities. The PBC is being developed with these future developments in mind.</p><p>Once completed, under the Public Spending Code, the PBC will be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and submitted to Government for its consideration. </p></reply>

However, BAM, as a Tier 1 construction company, has global reach into supply chains and is doing its best to mitigate those risks.</p>  <p>  Despite delays and Covid-19 restrictions, significant progress is being made on the site at St James&rsquo;s and the new children&rsquo;s hospital building is taking shape.  Over 90% of all concrete has been placed, with the concrete frame now complete. In March, a key milestone was reached when the last section of the seventh-storey was poured with concrete, meaning that the building has now topped out.  The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, closing in the concourse, will be complete by August 2021. </p>  <p>  Glazing and fa&ccedil;ade works are continuing such that the distinctive shape of the building is becoming clear. It is anticipated that the majority of the building will be weathertight by the autumn. The fit out of certain internal areas has begun, with discernible rooms and areas taking shape. The primary Mechanical and Electrical Plant comprising boilers; combined heat and power, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases are well progressed with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution around the building.</p>  <p>  A major milestone was reached in July 2019, when the Urgent Care Centre at the Connolly Hospital campus opened, providing a new model of ambulatory care for children. The opening of the second of the three new campuses, at Tallaght Hospital later this year, will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.  </p>  <p>  Construction work on the 4,600m2 facility is nearing an end, with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021. It will then be handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open for services after an 8-week period of operational commissioning and equipping. </p></reply>

Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of the contract for substantial enabling works.</p>  <p>  However, the ownership and governance arrangements are more complex. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. The draft legal framework that has been developed is designed to copper fasten these arrangements. </p>  <p>  I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be affirmed beyond doubt. </p>  <p>  In that context, and as I have previously stated, there will be further engagement with all stakeholders in relation to this project, as we move toward the finalisation of the legal arrangements. However, I will not be making any further comment on the nature of this engagement until it concludes.</p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which had a significant impact on acute hospitals.  </p><p>The HSE has been working since 14th May last to recover the effects of the cyber attack on its systems. The HSE advise that at present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and there are still a number of areas of ongoing concern. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak in the first quarter of this year and the ransomware attack has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services. My Department  does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13th May 2021</p><p>At the 13th of May 2021, nationwide there were 11,073 patients waiting for an adult or child orthopaedic IPDC procedure, a reduction of 19% (-2,569) compared to the same period last year. At the 13th May 2021 there were 75,799 waiting for a first outpatient appointment across all hospital groups, an increase of 6% (+4,379) compared to the same period last year.</p><p>Specifically in terms of hip and knee replacements, the NTPF have advised the Department that at the end of May 2020 there were 3,042 patients waiting for such a procedure. Through focused activity, and with the support of the NTPF, at the 13th May 2021 this figure had fallen by 26 % to 2,256 patients.</p><p>The NTPF have advised that they have provided funding for a number of Insourcing initiatives to reduce Orthopaedic waiting lists in 2021, which will see 15,385 patients receive appointments and procedures.

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Currently there are approximately 2,500 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme and as at 1 June, 21 panels, or less than 1%, are vacant. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. There are currently no vacancies in New Ross. </p>  <p>  Where a medical card or GP visit card holder experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, or where the person has been removed from another GP's list or refused entry onto a GP's list, the HSE has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.</p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 213 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021. The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

However, a number of legal issues were identified which necessitated further consideration.</p><p>Since services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019, there has been a limited number of reports of protests or other actions relating to termination of pregnancy.  This is an extremely positive development. It suggests that these services have bedded in relatively smoothly to date and are becoming a normal part of the Irish healthcare system, as intended.</p><p>Where problems do arise with protests outside healthcare services, there is existing public order legislation in place to protect people accessing services, staff and local residents.</p><p>The Department of Health has liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on safe access to services. The Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda Stations raising awareness about the issue. It directed that any protests be monitored, and breaches of existing law dealt with. The Department has provided information on existing public order and other relevant legislation to the HSE for appropriate distribution.</p><p>Termination of pregnancy services have continued to function during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic and associated restrictions has had a profound impact across society and especially for our older population.  </p>  <p>  All Community Health Organisations through the National Older Persons Office were requested in April 2021 to provide information on the status of their Day Care Services in order to ascertain the level of service that could resume on receipt of updated public health guidance.  As a result, it was intended that approximately 100 day centres would re-open week beginning 5 July. It was also intended that an additional 55 centres would resume in July and August, with a further 90 centres that require works expected to reopen before the end of the year.   It was indicated that these dates may be subject to change as the HSE continues to deal with the significant challenge of the on-going cyber attack.  </p>  <p>  Since then updated Public Health guidance to support the re-opening of Day Care Services for Older People was provided in June 2021 to facilitate re-opening plans. Following on from this a further information request issued to HSE Services to obtain an update on re-opening plans. The process for reopening of the centres has already commenced and it is expected that more centres will reopen in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which had a significant impact on acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>The HSE has been working since 14th May last to recover the effects of the cyber attack on its systems. The HSE advise that at present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and there are still a number of areas of ongoing concern. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak in the first quarter of this year and the ransomware attack has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services. My Department  does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently developing a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p></reply>

In response to the changing needs of the individuals that WCA support, it is proposed that the agency will receive &euro;41,009,426 in funding from the HSE in 2021.  This represents a significant improvement on funding levels since 2014, when the organisation was allocated &euro;28,774.642.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of our national specialist disability services, the Government provided an additional &euro;100 million in the 2021 Budget for new disability developments, which will see the budget for specialist disability services exceeding &euro;2.2 billion in 2021.</p>  <p>  This  allocation included funding of &euro;5.5m for the delivery of 9 new Respite Houses for Children with disabilities. Progress is well underway on the delivery of each of these houses over the next 6 months. St. Gabriel&rsquo;s in Limerick opened in May of this year, and I am pleased to note that The Hamlet in Swords will be operational this coming September. I also welcome the announcement that 85 additional therapy posts are now approved for the Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Team which will support the delivery of services in these special schools. </p>  <p>  In relation to capital funding, project prioritisation in the health sector is driven by healthcare needs. The HSE&rsquo;s service directorate must determine the service need and the most appropriate model of care. The role of the National Capital and Property Steering Committee is to prioritise projects and to recommend them for inclusion in the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual Capital Plan, subject to funding availability.</p>  <p>  In relation to multi-annual budgeting, in addition to the annual current expenditure levels which are set through the Estimates process, the Government now publishes indicative expenditure ceilings for current expenditure for a further two years which will operate as upper limits on expenditure for each year within the three-year period. Due to the level of uncertainty in 2021 as a result of the pandemic, Budget 2021 did not project multi-annual expenditure ceilings beyond 2021 at Estimates time in October 2020. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Review of Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements to 2032 has been completed, which examines the implications of anticipated changes in the size and structure of</p>  <p>the disability population for future service demand.   As we progress towards the vision outlined by Sl&aacute;intecare, it is essential that over the next number of years, the State moves to a population-based planning approach, based on demographic and geographic considerations, that reflects both the health and social care needs of those within our population, including those who require specialist disability services.   The Disability Capacity Review will be published in the coming days.  </p></reply>

The Department of Health continues to liaise closely with the National Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, security partners and with colleagues across the Public Service to ensure that best practice is followed as it relates to all aspects of cyber security.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Health Service Executive, in the wake of the recent ransomware attack, the HSE has deployed additional security toolsets and capabilities and applied recommendations from external consultants engaged following the ransomware attack. The HSE continues to engage with the National Cyber Security Centre and, with the support of my department, will continue to invest strategically in technical infrastructure, cyber defences and the resources necessary to protect the systems and data that are vital to the safe operation of the health system.</p>  <p>  The HSE has deployed additional expertise, resources and technology to provide enhanced monitoring of systems and networks. This is considered an interim measure as they procure a permanent Security Operations Centre to provide security and threat incidence monitoring and response including:</p>  <p>  - monitoring and alerting on portals and software;</p>  <p>  - monitoring and incident management of all devices on the network to ensure that all devices are compliant with rules/policies;</p>  <p>  - threat incident response including triage, close and/or escalation.</p>  <p>  Improved security measures have already been put in place within the Department of Health ICT systems. A complete security review of the ICT infrastructure is currently being finalised and specialised software has been installed to mitigate against malicious software, and to provide early warning notifications of same. The system is fully monitored, providing for a rapid response to any notified incidents.</p>  <p>  Inevitably, some planned health systems integration activities will require to be re-evaluated and re-planned in the aftermath of the ransomware attack.  Health systems cyber security and disaster recovery protocols will be informed by learnings from the recent criminal ransomware cyberattack. In keeping with procedures on any critical incident, post incident review findings and recommendations will inform the process of continuous improvement. When further planning health ICT systems modernisation and activities, both the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will be informed by recommendations made by the National Cyber Security Centre and post-incident reporting.</p></reply>

Today in Ireland, 86% - almost 9 in 10 women - feel that their own health is good or very good, so our starting point is incredibly strong.</p><p>But we also know that women have specific physical, mental and social health needs which services can struggle to meet. We know that women can have poorer health outcomes relating to certain conditions including some chronic diseases, cancers, and mental health conditions. </p><p>We know that women in minority or disadvantaged groups can face particular health inequalities. </p><p>Women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences are also affected by their roles in the family and society and their wider circumstances &ndash; for example more than 60% of unpaid carers are women which means they often access services on behalf of others.</p><p>We know that women often don&rsquo;t feel listened to within our health service and this has to change.</p><p><b>Recent Progress</b></p><p>There has been recent progress in the area of women&rsquo;s health including: </p><p>- the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy, </p><p>- implementation of the Sexual Health Strategy, </p><p>- establishment of a National Mesh Specialist Centre, </p><p>- improvements in screening services, </p><p>- improvements to sexual assault services, introduction of termination of pregnancy services, </p><p>- the rollout of the Maternal &amp;amp; Newborn-Clinical Management System, and</p><p>- the development of new models of care for ambulatory gynaecology and infertility.<b></b></p><p><b>Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce</b></p><p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce was established in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. </p><p>The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its twelfth meeting held earlier this month. Regular updates are provided through a dedicated webpage on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website at gov.ie. </p><p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce continues to work with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health to prioritise different issues each year with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.</p><p>Critical to this work is the process of listening to women - the Taskforce has so far listened to, engaged with and worked with more than 1,000 women and hundreds of organisations representing women and girls across the country. </p><p>Based on this information, the Taskforce has developed proposals to improve supports for gynaecological health, mental health, physical activity, and menopause all of which are rolling out this year and next year.</p><p>Through action like this forum, we can better address women&rsquo;s whole health and help ensure that action on women&rsquo;s health looks beyond reproductive health to make a real difference to women&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Work is ongoing to identify priorities for the year ahead, aligned to Sl&aacute;intecare, and I expect to bring these to Government for approval this Autumn.</p><p><b>Budget 2021</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that Budget 2021 provides a very significant investment to deliver on this commitment. This includes: </p><p>- funding of &euro;12m to ensure a renewed impetus to the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and the new model of maternity care, and to improve gynaecology services.  </p><p>- funding of &euro;10m to screening services including Breast Check and Cervical Check, </p><p>- and building on the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, a &euro;5m Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.</p><p>Through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund, the significant funding provided for maternity, gynaecology and fertility services, as well as the &euro;10m investment in screening services including BreastCheck and CervicalCheck, Budget 2021 has reiterated this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the further development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle. </p><p><b>Women&rsquo;s Health Fund</b></p><p>Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to implement a programme of actions arising from the work of the Taskforce.  </p><p>The first two proposals funded under the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund are:</p><p>- Two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services in Tallaght University Hospital and University Maternity Hospital Limerick.</p><p>- Expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis.</p><p>In 2021, the Fund will deliver:</p><p>- a national awareness to provide a trusted source of information and help normalise discussions about women&rsquo;s health,</p><p>- increased supports in the areas of gynaecology, menopause, mental health and physical activity, and </p><p>- further actions under priority areas to be decided in 2021.</p><p>Engagement is ongoing with Dept. of Health and HSE stakeholders to finalise further activities to be implemented under the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund in 2021. </p><p><b>Impact of COVID19 on women and girls</b></p><p>The Government recognises the significant physical, mental and social health challenges that women and girls in particular have faced due to the COVID19 pandemic and response. </p><p>These include particular impacts relating to:</p><p>- the high prevalence of women as frontline workers in health and retail sectors and within domestic and caring job roles; </p><p>- impacts on health services that are important to women&rsquo;s health specifically, such as restrictions on birth partners in labour; and </p><p>- wider issues such as the rise in domestic violence. </p><p>However, there have also been some positive service developments such as a new model of remote consultation for Termination of Pregnancy Services which will be continued. </p><p>Budget 2021 is supplemented by broader investment which will directly address some of the impacts of COVID19, including:</p><p>- &euro;38m for new mental health services and </p><p>- &euro;1.7 billion to protect health care workers, vulnerable groups and public from the impacts of COVID-19, and </p><p>- the recent launch of the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign which that which aims to support people and communities to mind their physical and mental health over the coming months including a new, free, online mental health and wellbeing programme called Minding Your Wellbeing. </p></reply>

The overall programme of improvement is the ongoing roll out of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People. This requires the reorganisation of all current HSE and HSE funded children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based Children's Disability Network Teams.</p>  <p>  The Progressing Disabilities Programme is doing this by forming partnerships between all the disability organisations in an area and pooling their staff with expertise in the different types of disabilities to form the Network Teams. These teams will provide for all children with significant disability, regardless of their diagnosis, where they live or where they go to school.</p>  <p>  The HSE is establishing a total of 91 Children&rsquo;s Disability Networks across each of the nine CHOs comprised of specialist inter-disciplinary Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams to work with children with complex disability needs. This reconfiguration of services under the Progressing Disability Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People programme is in line with Health Service Reform and the implementation of Community Healthcare Networks under Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  In addition, 100 new posts have been allocated under the HSE National Service Plan 2021. Funding for these posts will facilitate each area to determine the discipline and grade required to address the gaps in their Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams. The 2021 allocation of posts is being assigned to the CHO areas in two tranches of 50 posts and will further strengthen the capacity of Network Teams.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which had a significant impact on acute hospitals.  </p><p>The HSE has been working since 14<sup>th</sup>May last to recover the effects of the cyber attack on its systems. The HSE advise that at present most systems are operational and services are returning to normal activity. There is a challenge in back entering data and there are still a number of areas of ongoing concern. The HSE was already seeking to recover from the Covid peak in the first quarter of this year and the ransomware attack has delayed this and had the effect of increasing access delays for services. My Department  does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available. </p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13th May 2021. </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the NTPF has advised that as of 7 July 2021, funding has been approved for 273 In patient and Day Case procedures and 9,245 Outpatient appointments through insourcing initiatives at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin.  </p></reply>

The additional training places provide enhanced opportunities for doctors in Ireland and will ultimately support the delivery of shorter waiting times, the reduction of inappropriate hospital admissions, improved patient flow, and earlier discharge of patients to the community.  </p>  <p>  A significant expansion of the health and social care workforce is required to respond to the additional pressures caused by COVID-19 pandemic.  Budget 2021 provided for the longer-term expansion of the health service in order to meet the needs of the population, and funded the retention of these COVID-related posts on a permanent basis plus an additional circa 3,216 whole-time equivalents, funding a total increase of approximately 15,838 positions. Healthcare workers are being hired from across the range of professions, and recruitment campaigns continue to go live through the HSE and its recruitment teams. At the end of the April, the health sector workforce has 128,999 WTE, which is an increase of 9,182 WTE since the end of December 2019, and an increase of 1,915 WTE since the end of December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Reform Programme aims to address many of the challenges the health and social care system is facing, including through a stronger orientation towards primary and social care settings, community care provision through Community Health Networks and promoting integration of care. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare reform &ldquo;Workstream 6 &ndash; Workforce Planning&rdquo; programme, of the Slaintecare Implementation Strategy &amp;amp; Action Plan 2021-2023, is centred on having sufficient capacity in the workforce and the appropriate configuration of staff and skill-mix, which are integral to the delivery of safe and timely health and social care services.   Ensuring, that sufficient professionals are trained, attracted, and retained in the areas where need is anticipated, will form a key part of the work of Workstream 6 &ndash; Workforce Planning programme.</p></reply>

The timing of this, and other assemblies, over the lifetime of the Government has yet to be determined. One element critical to the success of assemblies has been the opportunity to meet in person. The restrictions experienced with Covid-19 have presented considerable difficulties in this regard, as meetings moved to being held online. The experiences and learning in this new way of working will inform how future citizen&rsquo;s assemblies are conducted.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Government agreed to adopt a health-led approach to people who use drugs, following the publication of the report of the working group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use, which was informed by 20,000 public responses. The approach will offer compassion, not punishment, to people who use drugs. The Programme for Government endorses this approach as an important step in developing a public health-led approach to drug use.</p>  <p>  An implementation group chaired by the Department of Health is finalising plans for the commencement of the Health Diversion Programme in 2021. The aim of the programme is to connect people who use drugs with health services and provide a pathway to recovery, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction. Under the programme, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will divert a person found in possession of drugs for personal use to the HSE for a health screening and brief intervention</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, the programme will be reviewed after the first full year of implementation to ensure that it is meeting all of it aims and to make any necessary changes.</p>  <p>  Another health-led approach is the drug treatment court in Dublin and other parts of the country. Together with the health diversion programme, these initiatives align with the strategic priority in the EU Drugs Strategy to provide alternatives to coercive sanctions for people who use drugs.  Ireland is committed to mainstream the implementation of effective measures that have a rehabilitative element and avoid a criminal sanction. To this end, Ireland will share comprehensive and in-depth data and exchange of best practices on alternatives to coercive sanctions with EU Member States.</p>  <p>The commencement of the Health Diversion Programme will demonstrate a health-led approach to drug use. I believe that a citizen's assembly could usefully considered the learnings from this programme and similar health-led initiatives in Ireland and internationally. It could also inform the development of new national drugs strategy, to replace the existing strategy when completed in 2025.  </p></reply>

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and with Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  Under the National Eating Disorder Model of Care, there are plans to develop 2 mini eating disorder hubs in CHO5. It is anticipated that a CAMHS mini eating disorder hub will be developed in Waterford and an adult mini eating disorder hub in Kilkenny, both of which will link up with the larger eating disorder hub network. Importantly, adults with eating disorders can access treatment from local community mental health teams. There are currently 112 adult community mental health teams nationwide. Children and adolescents can similarly access treatment through the 72 CAMHS teams  nationwide.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of &euro;3.94 million for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of 3 new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the 3 existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the expansion of the adult community team at the Mount Carmel site in Dublin, and this is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen real growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p>  <p>  As of last year, there are 3 specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, may require inpatient care for short periods for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS. One is the CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019).The other is in Dublin based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).</p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara in Dublin (8 beds) and Merlin Park in Galway (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need.</p>  <p>  There are plans for an eating disorder unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.</p>  <p>  For adults, people who may require in-patient care for short periods of time are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincents, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of 2 new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding annually to Bodywhys to run the helpline which is delivered by a team of trained volunteers. They also provide a range of services (support groups, online groups, email and family programmes) for adults and young people with eating disorders, and their families. The HSE also supports Bodywhys to run the PiLaR (Peer Led Resilience) Programme, a 4-week online modular based programme for parents, friends and carers of a person with an eating disorder to build resilience and gain support in their role as a carer. Additionally, in March 2019 the HSE launched the first Self Care App which provides valuable information for those with or people caring for someone with an eating disorder.</p>  <p>  People with eating disorders can additionally avail of our general mental health supports. The HSE provide a mental health text messaging support service, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers. Online counselling and supports are provided by Turn2Me, MyMind and other organisations. There are phone, text and email supports available through existing providers such as the Samaritans, Aware, Pieta and others. Furthermore, Jigsaw provides a variety of online, phone and text supports specifically to young people aged 12 to 25 years old.</p>  <p>  If an individual is concerned about themselves or someone known to them, they should be directed to their GP in the first instance for primary care screening assessment and examination. Their GP may then make recommendations which may include, if clinically indicated, referral to the secondary care mental health services for full eating disorder assessment.</p>  <p>  With the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.</p></reply>

To that end, the Department of Health continues to work closely with the Health Information and Quality Authority and nursing home providers to ensure that the highest standards continue to be met. The regulation referred to states that "On and from 1st January 2022, a bedroom in a designated centre which was carrying on the business of a designated centre on or before 1st July 2009 or a part of a designated centre where such business was carried on before that date shall have an area of not less than 7.4 square metres of floor space, which area shall include the space occupied by a bed".</p>  <p>  This regulation means that providers must provide a minimum of 7.4 square metres per resident in a bedroom, rather than requiring 7.4 square metres between residents.</p>  <p>  ?The HSE's National Service Plan 2021 contains a number of measures designed to mitigate the risk of a temporary reduction of capacity in some nursing homes arising from both regulatory compliance pending the completion of the Community Nursing Unit capital infrastructure programme and from infection and prevention control measures in place arising from COVID-19. These include funding for an additional 1,250 community beds to reduce the number of older people in long stay residential care through purposing existing or developing additional rehabilitation and intermediate care beds, expanding reablement and outreach services and by significantly increasing home support hours.</p>  <p>  With regards to the community nursing unit referred to by the Deputy, as this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE. However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems.

These placements have been continuing throughout the Pandemic and were only paused for a short time during the first and third waves. This occurred when the HSE required those staff who are normally assigned to support student education to be released to care for patients with COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The payment of clinical placement allowances to student nurses and midwives while on supernumerary clinical placement is governed by Department of Health Circular 09/2004.  This Circular provides for student nurses and midwives, in years 1-3 and the first semester of year 4, to receive a weekly accommodation allowance, currently of up to &euro;50.79 per week should their placement be away from their normal place of residence. It also covers reimbursement of their vouched travel costs.

Following my  acceptance of the key recommendation in the Collins report, a student nurse/midwife Pandemic Placement Grant (PPG) of &euro;100 per week for each week spent on supernumerary placement was introduced with effect from the start of the current academic year, September 2020.  The PPG is un-vouched and paid to every student nurse and midwife for every week of their supernumerary  clinical placement.  In addition to the PPG,  students can continue to avail of the existing travel and accommodation allowances,  </p>  <p>  I also directed that a second longer-term review take place. This review will include an examination of the existing clinical placement allowances payable to student nurses and midwives on supernumerary clinical placement as well as pay for the final-year internship placement. Conducted by Mr Sean McHugh, this review has commenced its work and while the HSE cyberattack has delayed progress , I expect to receive the report by the end of July.</p></reply>

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and with Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of &euro;3.94 million for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of 3 new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the 3 existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the expansion of the adult community team at the Mount Carmel site in Dublin, and this is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen real growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p>  <p>  As of last year, there are 3 specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, may require inpatient care for short periods for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS. One is the CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019).The other is in Dublin based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).</p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara in Dublin (8 beds) and Merlin Park in Galway (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need.</p>  <p>  There are plans for an eating disorder unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.</p>  <p>  For adults, people who may require in-patient care for short periods of time are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincents, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of 2 new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding annually to Bodywhys to run the helpline which is delivered by a team of trained volunteers. They also provide a range of services (support groups, online groups, email and family programmes) for adults and young people with eating disorders, and their families. The HSE also supports Bodywhys to run the PiLaR (Peer Led Resilience) Programme, a 4-week online modular based programme for parents, friends and carers of a person with an eating disorder to build resilience and gain support in their role as a carer. Additionally, in March 2019 the HSE launched the first Self Care App which provides valuable information for those with or people caring for someone with an eating disorder.</p>  <p>  People with eating disorders can additionally avail of our general mental health supports. The HSE provide a mental health text messaging support service, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers. Online counselling and supports are provided by Turn2Me, MyMind and other organisations. There are phone, text and email supports available through existing providers such as the Samaritans, Aware, Pieta and others. Furthermore, Jigsaw provides a variety of online, phone and text supports specifically to young people aged 12 to 25 years old.</p>  <p>  If an individual is concerned about themselves or someone known to them, they should be directed to their GP in the first instance for primary care screening assessment and examination. Their GP may then make recommendations which may include, if clinically indicated, referral to the secondary care mental health services for full eating disorder assessment.</p>  <p>  With the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.</p></reply>

The appreciation of the role of ventilation has evolved in the context of developing experience and evidence; guidance, training and measures implemented reflects this learning. Links to published guidance are provided below for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.  </p><p>The NPHET for COVID-19 regards ventilation as an important IPC measure and a NPHET subgroup, called the Expert Group on the Role of Ventilation in Reducing Transmission of COVID-19, was accordingly established in the early part of 2021 to provide scientific advice on ventilation and other control measures to reduce the risk of long-range (airborne) transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  </p><p>The Group has a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise in indoor air quality and related areas including, aerosol science, architecture, engineering, regulation, occupational hygiene, exposure science, virology, microbiology, and public health medicine.</p><p>It was agreed that the work of the Expert Review Group and its reports would be taken forward by the Senior Officials Group on COVID-19. Since then, it has informed Departments&rsquo; and Agencies&rsquo; work in respect of sectoral guidance and public information regarding ventilation. </p><p>The Expert Group submitted two reports while reporting to the NPHET at the Department of Health, which were duly considered by the HPSC and HSE-AMRIC in the context of updating its guidance. These reports, along with relevant agendas and meeting minutes are available on the gov.ie website: https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/aa43c-expert-group-on-the-role-of-ventilation-in-reducing-transmission-of-covid-19/#reports </p><p>It is the responsibility of individual Government departments to provide sector-specific COVID-19 advice on ventilation as per their respective remits.

The overall programme of improvement is the ongoing roll out of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People. This requires the reorganisation of all current HSE and HSE funded children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based Children's Disability Network Teams.</p>  <p>  The Progressing Disabilities Programme is doing this by forming partnerships between all the disability organisations in an area and pooling their staff with expertise in the different types of disabilities to form the Network Teams. These teams will provide for all children with significant disability, regardless of their diagnosis, where they live or where they go to school.</p>  <p>  The HSE is establishing a total of 91 Children&rsquo;s Disability Networks across each of the nine CHOs comprised of specialist inter-disciplinary Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams to work with children with complex disability needs. This reconfiguration of services under the Progressing Disability Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People programme is in line with Health Service Reform and the implementation of Community Healthcare Networks under Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  In addition, 100 new posts have been allocated under the HSE National Service Plan 2021. Funding for these posts will facilitate each area to determine the discipline and grade required to address the gaps in their Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams. The 2021 allocation of posts is being assigned to the CHO areas in two tranches of 50 posts. </p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (eg website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue.</p><p>On 4 May this year, I launched the latest round of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme to help Irish businesses to upgrade their websites and improve their competitiveness in online retail. The call for applications closed on the 25 May.  Under this call for applications, 173 retail businesses in Ireland were approved a total of &euro;6.3 million in funding.  To date, 503 retailers have been approved &euro;18.2m in funding under the COVID-19 Online retail Scheme.  I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector, through the Retail Forum, which I chair, in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.  It is my intention to open a further round of applications for funding later this year. </p><p>For retailers starting on the digital journey, Enterprise Ireland have put together a Starter Guide outlining the broad range of considerations to be addressed.  A copy of the guide can be found on </p><p>For retail businesses that fall outside the criteria of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme, there are many other financial and non-financial supports available. These include services offered through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme, administered by the LEOs, offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 with co-funding of 50% from the business along with training and advice to help businesses trade online.</p><p>Businesses that have already received a Trading Online Voucher can now apply for a second voucher, where upgrades are required. Funding can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers.  The voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions, to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p><p>The vouchers are targeted at businesses with the following profile:</p><p>- Limited or no e-commerce presence;</p><p>- 10 or less employees;</p><p>- Turnover less than &euro;2m;</p><p>- Applicant business must be trading for at least 6 Months**;</p><p>- Business must be located in the area covered by the LEO to whom they make their application i.e. LEOs cannot accept applications from businesses located outside their jurisdiction.</p><p>**applicant business must provide clear proof of trading for a minimum of 6 months to their Local Enterprise Office</p><p>The wide range of supports to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website </p></reply>

This investigation was requested by my Department in order to inform consideration of a request by the International Transport Workers Federation (ITWF) for the initiation of civil proceedings against the alleged employers.</p><p>In this instance the WRC decided not to pursue a civil prosecution. Indeed, there is no record of civil proceedings ever having been initiated under section 2B of the Employment Permits Act 2003.</p><p>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s current query is referring to a criminal prosecution, which arose from a separate investigation undertaken by the WRC.  This case was taken in the name of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in relation to alleged offences under the Employment Permits Act 2003, namely the employment of non-EEA nationals without an employment permit or valid permission to work.</p><p>This case was before District Court on 17<sup>th</sup>June 2021. As the Deputy will appreciate, the State does not comment on ongoing criminal proceedings. Given that the proceedings were imminent at the time of my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 159 on 15 June, it would have been inappropriate, and could have been considered prejudicial, to refer to those proceedings in my reply. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the criminal proceedings were dismissed on the day of the hearing by the presiding Judge, exercising his judicial authority in the matter.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.</p>  <p>  In order to work in Ireland a non-EEA National, unless they are exempted, must hold a valid Employment Permit or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an Employment Permit.  All applications for employment permits are processed in line with the Employment Permits Acts and associated Regulations which lay down in legislation the criteria in relation to the application, grant and refusal of an employment permit. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the State's vacancy led employment permit system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists.  These lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.  Applications are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation.  </p>  <p>  All Employment Permit applications are checked for immigration status to determine if an individual has the relevant permission from the Minister for Justice to reside &amp;amp; work in the State.  </p>  <p>  If the applicant is residing in the State under a valid immigration permission allowing them to access the labour market and they have a valid job offer, an Employment Permit application may be granted provided they meet all the requirements under the type of permit applied for.</p></reply>

I note that the business you refer to has also been impacted by Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As you know the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small business assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.  The level of business supports is unprecedented. </p>  <p>  I would urge businesses to ensure that they are aware of what is available to them.  Recently the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) has been expanded to include business that were not eligible for phase 1 of the scheme.  The scheme now allows businesses who operate from a non-rateable premises and businesses whose turnover is below &euro;50,000 to apply through their Local Authority.  The closing date for this scheme is 21st July.</p>  <p>  The Government has worked to ensure that there is a range of assistance in place for COVID-19-impacted businesses including the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme.</p>  <p>  I would urge the business you refer to to contact their Local Enterprise Office.  They direct businesses to supports that are available to them, they also mentor and offer advice for businesses and in particular they are best placed to offer advice in relation to Brexit supports available.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that all businesses supports are being kept under review to ensure that they are timely and target those that need them the most.</p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property. The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>  <p>  Universal and equitable access to safe, effective and affordable diagnostics, treatments and vaccines is crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.  The EU&rsquo;s participation in the recent G7 discussions, where additional commitments on the provision of vaccines globally was agreed, bears witness to that.</p>  <p>  The EU believes that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (The TRIPS Agreement), allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by proponents of the waiver.  Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing, which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p>  <p>  The EU has submitted a proposal for a Declaration to the WTO TRIPS Council, which seeks to clarify how the existing TRIPS flexibilities could be more effective than a waiver.  </p>  <p>  On the 4th of June, the EU also submitted a proposal to the WTO General Council, which proposes that WTO Members could agree on a global trade initiative for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics encompassing the three components of (i) trade facilitation and disciplines on export restrictions; (ii) concrete actions to expand production and ensure supply of vaccines at affordable prices to low and middle income countries during the pandemic and (iii) clarification and facilitation of TRIPS Agreement flexibilities relating to compulsory licenses.  </p>  <p>  Production capacity is a key issue here and, again at the recent G7 summit, the EU Commission announced &euro;1bn in funding towards the building and creation of an enabling environment in long-term vaccines manufacturing and production capacity in Africa.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions on how the intellectual property protections flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis and contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world. </p></reply>

In that regard stock abundance can only be assessed at the individual river stock level.Management advice on each stock is provided annually by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) which has statutory responsibility for salmon management. IFI is supported in its management by the assessment, carried out each year, of individual stocks and annual scientific advice from the Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS). </p>  <p>  The determining factor as to whether a fishery may be open is the availability of a harvestable surplus which does not negatively impact the sustainability of each stock. This determination is made with regard to the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive under which Atlantic salmon is a protected species. </p>  <p>  Fishing for salmon at sea is indiscriminate mixed stock fishing as it targets combined stocks from rivers in Ireland and other European countries. Many of the individual stocks are below safe biological limits and these stocks cannot be disaggregated at sea. The status of individual stocks is already well established and IFI research on aggregated stocks at sea necessarily concentrates on the significantly negative impacts on survival of migrating fish of factors such as sea-lice from salmon farms, predation and climate change in the marine phase of the salmon life-cycle. </p>  <p>  In order to comply with the EU Habitats Directive and the principles of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO), the Government decided in 2006 to cease all indiscriminate fishing in the sea and to manage all salmon fisheries strictly in line with scientific advice. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 8 July, over 233,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Westmeath in Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown, and Athlone. Pre-works have commenced in the areas around Mullingar. NBI has advised that surveying is underway in the area where the premises referred to in the Question is located and they anticipate that high speed broadband should be available for connection in the first half of 2022.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Whitehall Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Ballycomoyle GAA Club, and Clonkill Hurling Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de and Naomh Micheal have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State Intervention Area covered by the NBP as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has raised the matter with the service provider operating in the area and my Department will revert to the Deputy as soon as a response is received.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 8 July, over 233,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Mayo including in the areas of Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, Bunnyconnellan, Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla and Ringarraun. Surveys are commencing in the areas of Newport, Carrowbeg, Inishgort, Inishcottle, Myna, Fahy, Ashbridge, Glenisland, Srahmore, Glenhest, Comploon, Slogger and Tawnameeltoge. I am advised that pre-build works have commenced in areas around Castlebar and Ballina.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally). Covid-19 has affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The full extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in so far as possible.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. The Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. As part of that work NBI is engaging with all current build partners (eir and enet) to bring forward build activities and is also actively reviewing other possible build partners where such options could also speed up the build process. I am advised that these discussions are progressing well. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335  BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Belderrig Community and Research Centre, Bofeenaun Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Belderrig Community and Research Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, Keel Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Islandeady Community Centre, Finny Community Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Carrowkennedy and The Black Tom Freeman Sport and Community Amenities Centre, Aghamore (located 10.8km from the premises referred to). Further details can be found at .</p><p>Saint Coleman's National School, Scoil N&eacute;ifinn, Rathbane National School, Midfield National School, Meelick More National School, Kinaffe National School, Gortskehy National School, Facefield National School, Errew National School, Cloghans National School, Shraigh National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dooagh National School, The Brae Valley National School, Dookinella National School and Tavraun Central National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at . </p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that as of 8 July, over 233,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Cork including in the areas of Midleton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon, Kilpatrick. Surveys have started Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. I understand that surveying is underway in the area where the premises referred to in the Question is located. Main build works are ongoing in Carrigaline, Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown and Upper Rochestown. Pre-build works are ongoing in Midleton. </p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan. I am advised by NBI that, as of 8 July over 6,600 premises are passed in Counties Cork, Cavan and Galway and available for order and pre-order. As the programme continues to build momentum this figure is expected to grow month on month. In total over 19,000 premises can pre-order via retail service providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway and Limerick. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie , which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme.  The full extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in so far as possible. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335  BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Laharn Heritage Centre, Ballindangan Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Clogagh Community Hall, T.O. Park Labbamollaga, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Sherkin Island Community Hall, Glash Community Centre, Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Lissavard Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre (14.7km from the premises)  and Castletownkenneigh Community Centre (9.1km from the premises).  Further details can be found at .</p><p>Ballycroneen National School and Clogagh National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at https://nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that as of 8 July over 233,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties. This survey work has enabled detailed designs to be developed for each deployment area. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir, where Open eir ensures any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence.</p>  <p>  Main Fibre Build works are underway in 12 Counties covering a total of 43,000 premises and &ldquo;Make Ready&rdquo; Works which involves works by openeir to prepare their existing poles and ducts for re-use by NBI and also tree-trimming of the route for new poles and overhead cabling are underway in a further 6 Counties, covering an additional 52,000 premises. </p>  <p>  The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan. I am advised by NBI that, as of 8 July over 6,600 premises are passed in Counties Cork, Cavan and Galway and available for order and pre-order. As the programme continues to build momentum this figure is expected to grow month on month. In total over 19,000 premises can pre-order via retail service providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway and Limerick. </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.

NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally).  Covid 19 has affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. The Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. As part of that work NBI is engaging with all current build partners (eir and enet) to bring forward build activities and is also actively reviewing other possible build partners where such options could also speed up the build process. I am advised that these discussions are progressing well. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.  Of the 335 sites, some 116 schools have been installed with high speed broadband by NBI as part of this initiative, for educational access only.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at https://nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/  </p></reply>

Commercial peat extraction is subject to a dual consent process requiring planning permission and, for sites over 50 hectares, an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, there has been a history of widespread non-compliance with this dual consent process, with many operators in the sector lacking planning permission and / or an IPC licence.  </p>  <p>  Following a 2019 High Court judgment which re-affirmed, inter alia, that commercial peat extraction absent planning permission constitutes unauthorised development, the onus has been on operators to first regularise their activities via the planning system and then secure the necessary licenses before any recommencement can take place.  </p>  <p>  It is not open to the State to simply remove the requirement for operators to regularise their past unauthorised development, as this requirement is derived from EU law, and I believe the quickest route to regularisation is through engagement with the existing consent system rather than through the establishment of a new one.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the availability of supplies for horticulture use is concerned, this matter is being considered by a multi-stakeholder working group established earlier this year by Malcolm Noonan T.D., Minister for Heritage and Electoral Reform in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. In addition, officials from my Department are engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage​, to help identify all feasible options to support the supply of horticultural peat for the 2021 and 2022 seasons in particular.</p></reply>

The NBP contract was awarded following a detailed and comprehensive procurement process. In line with State Aid Guidelines, the procurement process was technology neutral meaning that the process did not specify a preferred technology. However, all bidders in the process proposed fibre as the best solution. National and international expertise points to a fibre based solution as being the most economical way to address all premises with a future proofed solution over the 25 year term of the NBP Contract.</p><p>In terms of whether the low earth orbit satellite technology could be used in the latterly scheduled regions of the National Broadband Plan intervention area, the NBP Contract allows NBI to explore alternative technologies, including satellite technology, if they are deemed necessary to assist delivery of the contract requirements. However, in doing so NBI must ensure that any alternative technologies utilised do not negatively impact on having a reliable and robust network available for all premises within the Intervention Area and that minimum contracted speeds are achieved. These considerations are a matter for NBI in the first instance. </p><p>It should be noted that under State Aid rules that subsidy cannot be awarded separately to an individual service provider, such as a satellite company, without a procurement process.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP and will provide high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network and people in the later stages of the roll-out can avail of high speed broadband at a number of BCPs around the country. The high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publically available sites and by the Department of Education for schools. As of 8 July 335 BCPs have been installed by NBI including 116 primary schools. Further information is available in this regard at .</p></reply>

Drivers with monocular vision cannot obtain or renew a category C (truck) driving licence. This matter was previously referred to the European Court of Justice, which determined that the minimum eyesight standards of the EU Directive (point 6.4 of Annex III to Directive 2006/126/EC, as amended) was compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, concerning equality before the law, non-discrimination on grounds of disability and the integration of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of individuals in any occupation, particularly those in which lives are at stake such as professional drivers, to ensure that they are fully aware of the safety and regulatory requirements of their profession.</p>  <p>  However, it is also clear that public bodies should ensure that individuals are made aware of changes that might fundamentally affect their ability to earn a livelihood.

This refers to a transport scheme&rsquo;s ability to impact upon a community&rsquo;s access to services and social amenities.  These criteria form the high-level criteria for appraising the expected benefits and impact of the scheme. Sponsoring agencies preparing business cases for transport schemes are required to consider and assess if any accessibility and social impacts for the general public and in particular, vulnerable groups&mdash;either positive or negative&mdash;are likely to arise as a result of the investment. Such vulnerable groups include, for example, those experiencing social deprivation, geographic isolation, physical or intellectual impairment. It is required that, to the extent that is possible, the scale of the anticipated impacts is set out within the appraisal, along with the specific groups likely to be impacted and how many people in those groups are likely to be impacted. </p><p>In respect of the requirements outlined above, I also note that the Strategic Research and Analysis Division in my Department is currently undertaking a work programme to review, update and improve the Departments existing sectoral guidance (the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes 2016).  This review and update will reflect the new requirements for evaluating, planning and measuring public investment as set out in the recently revised Public Spending Code published at the end of 2019. It also includes an examination of current approaches to measuring the impacts of projects or service changes to identify improvements that can be made. I expect that an updated Common Appraisal Framework will be published in the second half of 2021. </p><p>In relation to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), projects are delivered in compliance with the international, national, regional and local policy. Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan, for example, include 10 strategic objectives including: </p><p>- 3. To Strengthen Rural Economies and Communities,</p><p>- 5. A Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills,</p><p>- 10.  Access to quality Childcare education and Health Services.</p><p>The public spending code sets out the rules and procedure to ensure that the best value for money is achieved in the delivery of projects using public funding. The code requires the setting of objectives for the project and how project should be assessed.  Project options are assessed against how they comply with the project objectives as well as under the following criteria Economy, Safety, Environment, Accessibility  and Social Inclusion as well as Integration and Physical Activity.  </p><p>Assessment of the proposed project is also carried out as part of the planning approval process which is set out in law and under the associated regulations.  In relation to roads, the range of deliverables, as set out in TII&rsquo;s Project Management Guideline and all projects funded by TII, are assessed in line with these Guidelines.</p><p>I have also referred your question to the other agencies under the aegis of my Department for direct reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply with 10 working days.</p></reply>

There are no plans to move from that environmental rationale towards taxing vehicles on the basis of width.</p>  <p>  Applying width as the basis of motor tax for other classes of vehicle could potentially increase motor tax rates for vehicles that are larger by virtue of their function, but which provide an essential public or economic service, such as buses and heavy goods vehicles. </p></reply>

The NTA works with the relevant public transport operators, who have responsibility for day to day operational issues, to progressively make public transport accessible.</p>  <p>  From a policy perspective we are progressively making public transport accessible by ensuring that new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and retro fitting older facilities to make them accessible.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s high level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of &lsquo;Transport Access for All&rsquo;. This policy is based on the Disability Act 2005, key national strategies, including the NDIS and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES) 2015-2024 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD).</p>  <p>  As well as these two key national strategies, there are also public transport accessibility related actions in a range of other Departmental and &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; strategies where lead responsibility has been assigned to my Department, the NTA and the public transport Agencies. All these actions across all such strategies have been combined into my Department&rsquo;s Accessibility Work Programme. The actions in the Work Programme are grouped under 11 broad Themes to reflect the priority actions in the NDIS, including action no. 100, the CES, and the UNCRPD.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport&rsquo;s Accessibility Work Programme is updated regularly to align with meetings of the NDIS Steering Group, and meetings of the Department&rsquo;s Accessibility Consultative Committee (ACC). The most recent meetings of the ACC and the NDIS Steering Group were on 02 June and 15 June 2021 respectively. All of the Department&rsquo;s Work Programme Progress Reports from 2017 to 15 June 2021, can be found at </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/collection/ed138c-work-programme/. Each Progress Reports contains updates in relation to the NDIS, including Action no. 100.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-13a.640.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021071300081#WRO01500"><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. On 1 June, the Government approved the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021 as a key policy instrument to continue to provide the necessary employment support for eligible businesses.  </p>  <p>  Regarding eligibility for the scheme up until 30 June 2021, an employer had to be  able to demonstrate that his or her business would experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 30 June 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  However, the position is that for EWSS claims from 1 July 2021, the reference period against which the turnover condition will be judged has been broadened out from a six month period to a full year so that turnover in the full year 2021 is compared with that for the full year in 2019, with appropriate arrangements for qualifying businesses who may not have been in operation for all of 2019.  All other things being equal, this should allow a greater number of firms to qualify for the scheme than would be the case if the a six month reference period along the lines of that mentioned above had been retained. At the same time, the existing requirement for a 30% decrease in turnover is being retained and there are no plans at the present time to modify same in the manner mentioned by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  With some businesses remaining closed or limited in their capacity to trade due to the public health restrictions in place, upon the resumption of normal trading, such businesses can potentially generate turnover or customer orders of up to 70% of their full turnover/customer orders for 2019 during the remainder of 2021 and may remain eligible to claim support under the scheme.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that the EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an EWSS Eligibility Review Form through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue will be necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th   of the following month.  For example, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of July will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 August. </p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme. This, together with Revenue&rsquo;s EWSS ongoing real-time compliance program, will reduce the possibility of employers, inadvertently or incorrectly, claiming EWSS amounts to which they are not entitled and having to subsequently repay those amounts to Revenue. </p>  <p>  Where businesses do not meet the requisite 30% turnover reduction, Revenue will not seek repayment of EWSS claimed on foot of projections which are robustly prepared, reflect the actual trading environment throughout the period they cover, and differed from the actual position by an immaterial amount.  However, if the projections prepared together with actual results to date do not meet the 30% reduction, the business should deregister for EWSS and cease submitting additional claims.   </p>  <p>  Finally, employers must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance for the duration of the scheme.  </p></reply>

Revenue and the other State agencies clear shipments as quickly as possible once the business provides the necessary information or documentation.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that it is unaware of delays of three weeks once the necessary supporting documentation is provided. Revenue is aware of delays that occur prior to the provision of such information where the importer has difficulties obtaining the relevant information from other parties in the supply chain or where there is a breakdown in communications along the supply chain. Where a business encounters delays in clearing shipments, the business should contact Revenue on the Revenue Customs helpline - 01-7383685. The Customs helpline is manned on a 24/7 basis in order to assist businesses moving shipments through our ports and airports. In addition, Revenue also has a Brexit Queries mailbox - BrexitQueries@revenue.ie. If the Deputy forwards details of any instances where there have been such delays to my Department we will follow up with Revenue. Alternatively, he can forward details directly to Revenue for follow up. </p></reply>

In the first instance, the Central Bank is the independent regulator for financial services and as such it determines what measures or actions need to be taken in relation to any potential or actual wrongdoing by regulated financial service providers.  The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to engage with domestic and European counterparts to determine if further action is needed to ensure additional clarity for investors on the implications of investing in unregulated products of this nature.</p>  <p>  On the specific matter of the sale of unregulated investment products in this jurisdiction, European and Irish legislation requires the regulation of financial services firms providing investment services in relation to investment products. The law is prescriptive and lists the various type of investment services and investment products falling to be regulated.  Regulated firms may also sell investment products which are not specifically mentioned in the law (i.e. unregulated products). Consequently regulated firms are not prohibited from providing services in relation to unregulated products. Where they do so, certain investor protections, which apply to regulated activities, are not applicable to unregulated products.</p>  <p>  However, regulated firms subject to the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (CPC) that provide financial services to consumers in relation to unregulated financial products, must comply with provisions 4.8 and 4.9 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s CPC. These provisions state the following: </p>  <p>  4.8 A regulated entity may only use the regulatory disclosure statement in communications with a consumer where such communications relate solely to a regulated activity.</p>  <p>  4.9 A regulated entity must have separate sections on any website it operates, for regulated activities and any other activities which it carries out.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Pensions Authority is currently investigating if there are any pension scheme trustee duty issues of concern related to this case. The Pensions Authority has a mandate to investigate the behaviour and activities of Pension Scheme Trustees, and it has been noted that the relevant pension vehicles which are involved in this case are one member arrangement schemes, known as small self-administered schemes (SSAPs) and non-standard Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSA). You will appreciate that it will be for the Pensions Authority to take whatever actions it deems appropriate under its mandate. </p>  <p>  Consumers may have recourse to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) in relation to financial services provided to them by regulated firms. The FSPO is the statutory body tasked with the investigation, mediation and adjudication of complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers. It is worth noting that the FSPO is empowered to investigate complaints of mis-selling by regulated financial service providers and has carried out investigations in this area in the past. If a consumer wishes to pursue a complaint in relation to a regulated financial service provider, they must firstly make a complaint to the provider. If the complaint is not resolved, they can then make a complaint to the FSPO.  </p>  <p>  The FSPO has the power to direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;500,000 to a complainant. The FSPO can also direct that a financial service provider rectify the conduct that is the subject of the complaint. There is no limit to the value of rectification he can direct.</p>  <p>  I trust that this helps to clarify the position.</p></reply>

This analysis is available on budget.gov.ie and shows that each of those Budget packages were broadly progressive. In relation to Budget 2021, this analysis concluded that the lowest four income deciles benefitted the most as a proportion of disposable income, a finding which was supported by the ESRI&rsquo;s own analysis of the budgetary package. </p>  <p>  Over Budgets 2017-2021 my Department also published an analysis of the progressivity of the income tax and welfare system. This is a cross country comparison of the degree to which our tax and welfare systems reduce income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. The latest analysis showed that Ireland recorded the second highest reduction in income inequality in the OECD between market incomes, i.e. before tax and welfare measures, and disposable incomes, after tax and welfare measures. </p>  <p>  Outside of the budgetary process, as part of the review of the Local Property Tax in 2019, the distributional impact which a number of illustrative scenarios could be expected to have on levels of disposable household income was modelled across varying income deciles, and results shown relative to a no policy change baseline using the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model. This distributional impact assessment was undertaken in order to assess the relative progressivity of each scenario. </p>  <p>  In addition, for a number of years, the annual Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper on income tax has provided an overview of the distribution and burden of income tax and USC across income earners. Depending on the particular issue(s) under consideration by the TSG in any given year, further social impact assessments may be included in the TSG paper. For example, the recent income tax TSG papers included analysis in respect of equality proofing and gender proofing of certain aspects of the income tax system. In addition, the Department of Finance regularly carries out reviews of tax expenditures. By way of example, the Home Carers Tax Credit was reviewed in 2019 and included an assessment of the credit in terms of its impact on gender and household income coverage. </p>  <p>  Finally, in recent years, there has been increasing moves internationally to broaden attempts to estimate the living standards of the population beyond traditional aggregate economic statistics such as GDP.  In recognition of this, my Department published a paper on Well-being and the Measurement of Broader Living Standards in Ireland with Budget 2021. The Programme for Government also committed to developing new measures of well-being in order to create a broader context for policy-making. An expert group to guide the development of a national well-being framework has now been convened through the Department of the Taoiseach, with the Department of Finance a member and a joint sponsor of the work.  It is anticipated that the new well-being measures can serve, over time, as a useful reference for a range of policy and budgetary reform initiatives which are currently underway, including: performance budgeting, equality budgeting, spending reviews and proofing of policy proposals against environmental and other goals.</p>  <p>  As the development of budgetary policy is not within their remit, the bodies under the aegis of my Department do not undertake social impact assessments.</p></reply>

Work will now continue with a view to finalising a comprehensive agreement in October.</p>  <p>  Ireland has fully supported the Pillar One proposals. This is in recognition that the way in which business is conducted has evolved and that the taxation system must evolve with it. There will be a cost to Ireland for this in terms of reduced corporation tax receipts, but overall Pillar One will bring stability and certainty to the international tax framework and will help underpin economic growth from which all can benefit.</p>  <p>  Ireland expressed our broad support for the agreement on Pillar Two but noting our reservation about the proposal for a global minimum effective tax rate of &lsquo;at least 15%&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  A Consultation on OECD International Tax Proposals will be launched by my Department in the coming days. Interested parties will be invited to respond to this consultation on Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the international tax proposals being discussed at the OECD/G20 BEPS Inclusive Framework and, specifically, in relation to how our approach and those proposals can continue to support economic growth and prosperity. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to the OECD process and aim to find an outcome that Ireland can yet support. Ireland will continue to play our part in reaching a comprehensive sustainable and equitable agreement.</p></reply>

With the return form, Revenue will also issue a document called a &lsquo;Notice of Estimate&rsquo; containing an amount of LPT. This is <b>not </b>an assessment of the valuation of that person&rsquo;s property. Instead, it is an amount of local property tax that will become payable should a liable person not submit a self-assessed value to Revenue. While the amount may coincide with the value a liable person would self-assess, the person is still required to submit a return to Revenue containing his or her self-assessment. It is important to note that Revenue does <b>not</b>value individual properties for the purposes of selecting the amount of LPT to be used in the &lsquo;Notice of Estimate&rsquo;.</p><p>Revenue will accept, on a non-judgemental basis, liable persons&rsquo; self-assessed valuations, subject to the usual compliance checks that may subsequently be carried out in relation to all self-assessed taxes. Revenue is preparing extensive guidance that will be made available to property owners in advance of the issuing of returns to assist them in self-assessing the value of their property. </p><p>Regarding new build properties, Revenue will not be in a position to analyse the data and report quantitatively on these until after LPT returns are submitted and processed.</p><p>As is currently the case, Revenue will provide a wide range of payment options to liable persons which will allow them to choose the payment option that best suits their particular circumstances.  Payment of LPT liabilities for 2022 can be made in one single payment or can be phased evenly over the year from January 2022.  Details of the payment options available to liable persons will be provided with the issuing of LPT return forms.</p></reply>

This means that each partner is chargeable to tax on her/his own income and is entitled to the basic annual personal tax credit of &euro;1,650. Neither partner will be entitled to the increased standard rate cut-off point and, tax credits, tax bands, and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.</p><p>Parts 44 and 44A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide for joint assessment of a couple for tax purposes. However, joint assessment is available only to married persons or civil partners who live together. Joint assessment for other cohabiting couples is not provided for in the tax code.</p><p>Information on the taxation of cohabiting couples can be found on the Revenue website, available at .</p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution which compels the State to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p><p>Differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples arise from the objective of dealing with different circumstances while also respecting the constitutional requirement to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased. There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce, in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p><p>Furthermore, the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to Income Tax, and is also a feature of other taxes, such as Capital Acquisitions Tax. Therefore, any changes in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development more generally, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective.</p><p>The arrangements and associated legislation for the purposes of payments or allowances under the remit of the Department of Social Protection in relation to married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and her Department.</p></reply>

This is why it is important for consumers to shop around when it comes to renewal. </p>  <p>  More specifically in relation to no claims bonuses, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland for more information on the matter. It indicated that the administration of no claims bonuses is a matter for each individual insurance provider. The amount of discount offered, and the terms and conditions attached to same will vary according to the customer, policy, the nature of the risk and the provider. Insurance Ireland also noted that &lsquo;step back&rsquo; and &lsquo;protected&rsquo; no claims bonus/discount products are available in the market. It is important for a policyholder to review their policy documents in detail to understand the cover that they have in place in relation to no claims bonuses/discounts. </p>  <p>  Where a consumer feels that they are being treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance, and it can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p><p>On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence.</p><p>An appeals hearing was held on 22<sup>nd</sup>April, followed by two hearings in each May and June. One hearing has been held so far this month. </p><p>The Medical Board of Appeal holds regional hearings as demand arises. I have been informed that a hearing is scheduled for Cork on 9<sup>th</sup>September. A hearing was scheduled for Roscommon last October, however due to Covid 19, unfortunately it was not possible to hold the clinic. </p><p>It is important that the Medical Board of Appeal conducts appeals in the appropriate clinical environment and that adequate numbers of persons attend regional clinics to ensure that the Board can assess as many applicants in the year as possible.</p></reply>

ETF investments can take many different legal and regulatory forms even where they are established within the same jurisdiction. </p><p>An ETF is an investment fund that is traded on a regulated stock exchange. A typical ETF can be compared to a tracker fund in that it will seek to replicate a particular index. </p><p>There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs.  Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the TCA 1997 for such funds. The domicile of the ETF will decide the applicable fund regime (i.e. domestic or offshore).</p><p>The tax treatment of an investment in a fund depends on a number of factors, the first of which is whether the fund is an Irish fund or an offshore fund.  The response below addresses the Deputy's query firstly with respect to the domestic fund regime and secondly with respect to the offshore fund regime.</p><p><b>Domestic Fund Regime </b></p><p>Section 58 of the Finance Act, 2000 introduced the gross roll-up taxation regime for domestic investment undertakings. The legislation is contained in Part 27 &ndash; Chapter 1A &ndash; sections 739B to 739J of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. </p><p>The general thrust of the regime is that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund. However, a fund has responsibility to deduct exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund. To prevent indefinite or long-term deferral of this exit tax, a disposal is deemed to occur every 8 years. Further information is contained within Tax and Duty Manual 27-01a-02 available on the Revenue website.</p><p>Exit tax on investments in collective investment undertakings (including Exchange Traded Funds &ldquo;ETFs&rdquo;) applies on the occurrence of a &ldquo;chargeable event&rdquo;. Exit tax applies to the profit element of each chargeable event, and chargeable events include &ndash;</p><p>- the making of relevant payments (which includes any dividend),</p><p>- the redemption of units,</p><p>- the transfer by a unit holder of their entitlement to units,</p><p>- the appropriation or cancellation of units by a fund to discharge tax payable on a gain arising from a transfer of units by a unit holder, and</p><p>- the ending of an 8-year period beginning with acquisition and each subsequent 8- year period (where such ending is not otherwise a chargeable event).</p><p>As such, exit tax applies on the payment of a dividend. </p><p>When looking at a deemed disposal, the amount to which exit tax applies is the growth in value of the investment.  Therefore, when calculating the amount on which exit tax applies for a deemed disposal, any amounts already paid out as dividends are excluded. There is no double taxation of the amount paid out as dividends.</p><p>In addition, any tax collected on a deemed disposal is available as a credit against any tax that arises on a subsequent actual disposal. </p><p><b>Offshore Fund Regime</b></p><p>Offshore funds legislation is contained within Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of Part 27 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p><p>Where the fund is located in an EU, EEA or OECD country and has a double taxation agreement in place with Ireland, and the fund is similar to an Irish fund, then rules very similar to those set out above for an Irish fund will apply, including those in respect of deemed disposals.</p><p>Where the fund is located in an EU, EEA or OECD country and has a double taxation agreement in place with Ireland, and the fund is not similar to an Irish fund, the profits, gains and distributions are taxed in the same way as an investment in shares in a company (as such there are no deemed disposals).</p><p>Where the fund is located in another territory (i.e. other than an EU, EEA or certain OECD countries), the tax treatment will depend on whether the fund is a &ldquo;distributing fund&rdquo; or not. Of note there are no deemed disposals.</p><p>Revenue guidance on the taxation of offshore funds is published in Tax and Duty Manual 27-04-01 (offshore funds located in an EU or EEA state or in an OECD member with which Ireland has a double tax agreement) and Tax and Duty Manual 27-02-01 (offshore funds located in other territories), which are available on the Revenue website.  </p><p>Tax treatment of investments in &ldquo;distributing funds&rdquo;</p><p>A distributing fund is a fund located in another territory (i.e. other than an EU, EEA or certain OECD countries), that distributes its profits to its unit holders from year to year. </p><p>The default position is that unless a fund applies to, and is certified by, Revenue as a distributing fund, it is a non-distributing fund. The list of distributing funds approved by Revenue is published on the Revenue website.</p><p>Investments in distributing funds are taxed in the same way as an investment in shares.  Income payments from a distributing offshore fund are subject to income tax under the general principles of taxation. USC and PRSI may therefore be applicable. Gains arising on disposals are subject to CGT at a rate of 40%.</p><p>The individual must account for any tax due under self-assessment. </p><p>Tax treatment of investments in non-distributing Funds</p><p>Income payments from a non-distributing offshore fund (being any offshore fund located in another territory (i.e. other than an EU, EEA or certain OECD countries), that is not certified as a distributing fund), are subject to income tax under the general principles of taxation. USC and PRSI may be applicable.</p><p>Where a person disposes of an investment in a non-distributing offshore fund, income tax under Case IV will apply. Although these disposals are charged to income tax, the amount of the gains on the disposal is calculated according to general CGT rules. USC and PRSI may be applicable.</p><p>The individual must account for any tax due under self-assessment. </p><p><b>Review of savings and investment</b></p><p>The issue of the taxation treatment of financial products has come to the fore since reductions in the rate of DIRT in 2017, which led to an analysis of the savings and investment trends apparent in society.</p><p>In 2018 officials in my Department published a report entitled The Taxation of DIRT and LAET - A review on the comparisons and tax treatment of DIRT and LAET. This report examined the tax treatment of financial products subject to DIRT and financial products subject to life assurance exit tax (LAET).  It concluded the products subject to DIRT and products subject to LAET are different in a number of respects, namely, the level and application of fees to clients, the level of risk and return and potential losses, and hence the way in which they are taxed.</p><p>This was further  reviewed in the most recent Capital and Savings Taxes Tax Strategy Group paper, published in September 2020. The conclusion was that the option to reduce rates of LAET to 33% would cost &euro;22 million in a full year, and that it could have potential consequences for the tax treatment of other similar investment products. It was also felt that given the current fiscal pressures, the possibility of reducing the rate of LAET is significantly diminished, particularly given the lack of evidence to support any distortionary impact of the rate.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-13a.700.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021071300082#WRP01700"><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.8 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;627 million have been granted to 50,500 employers in respect of 609,700 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made early last month, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.</p>  <p>  While the Government has agreed that the EWSS should be extended to end Q4 2021, it is too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.</p>  <p>  Similarly, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.</p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such, and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. The precise manner in which such a change might be implemented is a matter to be considered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to extending the EWSS to owners of private childcare cr&egrave;ches.   However, it is unclear what the Deputy might be specifically referring to.  As outlined above, all qualifying employers are entitled to claim the EWSS and in the case of the childcare sector, childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS, in respect of the eligible employees on their payroll.</p>  <p>  In the event that the Deputy is referring to sole traders who run private childcare cr&egrave;ches, it should be noted that the EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. Subject to meeting the requisite conditions, a sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer. As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is a significant economy wide support for employers, but it is not the only measure that the Government have put in place to support businesses at this time.</p>  <p>  There are a range of other business support measures available. For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June last a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

The framework complements existing budgetary impact assessment exercises conducted by my Department and the Departments of Finance, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and externally by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  </p><p>Social Impact Assessments can be quantitative, measuring the change in incomes as a result of policy, or qualitative, offering a description of how policies affect households&rsquo; financial positions.  Within the SIA framework, households may be broken down into different groups based on income, economic status, household composition and age.</p><p>My Department has been involved in the development of 20 papers published under the Social Impact Assessment framework since 2016, spanning a number of policy areas including health, education, childcare, the labour market and the environment.  The details of these papers are set out in the table below.  In relation to the bodies under the aegis of my Department, no social impact assessments have been conducted during the specified timeframe.</p><p>Additional detail on Social Impact Assessments and the SIA framework can be found at the following link: </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/615fe5-social-impact-assessment-framework/ <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Title </th>       <th>Sector </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment &ndash; SEAI Programmes Targeting Energy Poverty</td>       <td>Environment </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment Series Student Grant Scheme (SUSI Grants)</td>       <td>Education </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>Prevention and Early Interventions Supporting Health and Well-Being   in Older Age</td>       <td>Health </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Programmatic Interventions for Children, Young People and their   Parents</td>       <td>Childcare </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Family Services Supporting Children and their Parents</td>       <td>Childcare </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment (SIA): Acute Mental Health Services</td>       <td>Health </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment (SIA): Nursing Home Support Scheme</td>       <td>Health </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Public Service Obligation (PSO) Funding for Public Transport</td>       <td>Transport </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA: Equality Budgeting &ndash; Relevant Findings from Ex Post Evaluation</td>       <td>Expenditure Reform</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA: Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA)</td>       <td>Social Protection</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>Dialogues on Effective Prevention and Early Intervention Approaches   in Human Services</td>       <td>Health </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Early Learning and Childcare</td>       <td>Childcare </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Educational Welfare</td>       <td>Education </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA Series - Assessment of Living Standards during Recovery Period</td>       <td>Macro </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA Series - Social Housing Supports</td>       <td>Housing </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA Series - Childcare Supports</td>       <td>Childcare </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA Series - Female Labour Market Participation</td>       <td>Labour Market</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>SIA Series - National Minimum Wage</td>       <td>Labour Market</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment   of Targeted Childcare Schemes</td>       <td>Childcare </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Social Impact Assessment of General Medical Services Scheme</td>       <td>Health </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works.  While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction.</p><p>Following the flood event, which occurred in August, 2020 in the Rossa Road area, Cork County Council and its consultants have been undertaking assessments of the problem.  While all assessments are not yet finalised, some discussions have taken place with a local landowner with a view to completing some remedial/improvement works this summer.  Any further works can only be progressed once the required reports are completed.</p><p><b>Bandon:</b></p><p>The <b>Bandon</b>Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 16th October 2020.</p><p>A number of additional minor items are still planned to be completed, such as fencing, railings and conservation works to Bandon Bridge.</p><p>Work is ongoing on preparing the operation and maintenance plans for the scheme and it is envisaged that the maintenance and operation of the scheme will be carried out for and on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council. </p><p>As part of the recently completed flood relief scheme for Bandon, the Office of Public Works installed a large &lsquo;rock-ramp&rsquo; fish pass in the Bandon River, measuring some 130m, in October 2018.  The rock ramp was essential to mitigate the impact on fish passage at the weir, which arose from deepening the channel downstream of the weir.  The fish pass was designed by international experts, with input from national experts in the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLH), along with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).</p><p>In March 2021, the OPW became aware that the boulders, rock and gravel material that formed the bed of the ramp had deteriorated, possibly as a result of extreme flows in the river in February 2021. The OPW immediately carried out inspections, accompanied by IFI representatives and the fisheries&rsquo; specialist on the Project.</p><p>The site inspections identified serious deterioration of the rock and gravel bed materials used in the construction of the fish pass, over its full length.  Of immediate concern was the erosion of bed material at the upstream end of the fish pass, which had resulted in the retaining wall, originally constructed below the bed level of the pass, becoming exposed and creating a &lsquo;step&rsquo; up from the bed level immediately downstream of it.  The situation was creating serious difficulties for various aquatic species in migrating over this newly exposed &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the fish pass, particularly in low flows.</p><p>The OPW and IFI agreed that urgent measures needed to be implemented to alleviate this problem.  An Appropriate Assessment Screening was completed, in line with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, and an AA Determination Statement was prepared. The proposed solution comprised large, natural boulders placed in a line across the width of the fish pass - close to the &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the pass - to create a pool from which the fish can pass with greater ease.</p><p>Following consultations with landowners for access for the proposed works and following environmental approval, the emergency works were successfully completed. </p><p>While these emergency works were critical in solving the immediate problem, an investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass has commenced and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue with the carrying out of any necessary works when the investigations are completed. </p><p><b>Clonakilty:</b></p><p>The <b>Clonakilty</b>Flood Relief Scheme undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council was substantially completed on 4th February 2021 by the main contractor, Ward and Burke Ltd and now provides protection to 296 properties.</p><p>A number of minor works to address outstanding items and snags will be completed by the contractor during the coming weeks.</p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.</p></reply>

This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. Significant and sustained progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country.

From 5 July the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events have increased to a maximum of 200 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 500 for outdoor stadia/venues with a minimum accredited capacity of 5,000. Subject to improving public health conditions, further easing of restrictions will be considered for August and we anticipate further increases in the numbers permitted at both indoor and outdoor events.</p>  <p>   In respect of the sports sector, my Department has been working since October 2020 with a combined working group of the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA and Sport Ireland.  The working group's guidelines, prepared with the assistance of health and safety experts, are designed for use by event organisers and have been published. The guidelines describe how spectators can safely be accommodated at sporting events.</p>  <p>  The Government also recently agreed on pilot events for both entertainment and sport and these events are ongoing.  The pilot events for sport use measures to mitigate against COVID-19 including reduced attendances, careful communication with spectators, physical distancing, mask-wearing, the careful management of entrance and departure of spectators and hand sanitising. Spectators are required to agree to a code of conduct for the event and advised not to attend if they are feeling the symptoms of COVID-19.  A health screening questionnaire is communicated to spectators before events. Full refunds are available to spectators should they need to stay away from the event for health reasons. Sporting bodies apply the guidelines to each event. The specific circumstances and unique character of each venue are taken into account when considering attendances for events. </p>  <p>  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events in line with the guidelines whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities. They assess and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by sectors. The pilot events have allowed sports bodies and stadiums to put in place the necessary safety measures and have allowed for  the safe return of spectators. Pilot events are being held not just in Dublin but throughout the country. For example, in the period to 19 July events will be held in Sligo, Mayo, Limerick, Cork, Tipperary and Dublin. Athletics, cricket, association football, gaelic football, camogie, hurling and rugby are some of the examples of the sports involved. </p>  <p>  I remain firmly committed to the full return of all live events at the earliest possible date, having regard to public health developments, and the pilot performances and sporting events, together with a wide range of horizontal and direct supports for the sector, are all part of a suite of measures designed to sustain and support the sector in its recovery.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland does not maintain or manage walking trails nor does it allocate funding towards trails development or wheelchair accessibility on trails. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has responsibility for Sport Ireland Outdoors (formerly the National Trails Office). Sport Ireland Outdoors is focused on supporting and promoting participation in all forms of outdoor sport in Ireland. Sport Ireland Outdoors promotes the planning and development of recreational trails and outdoor recreation infrastructure by promoting standards and best practice in the development of walking, cycling and water trails. Sport Ireland Outdoors maintains a National Trail Register of over 900 approved trails that align with the prescribed standards for trails in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I understand that funding may be allocated for trails accessibility projects under the Outdoors Recreation Infrastructure scheme (ORIS), which is managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Questions in relation to funding under the ORIS are more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Sport Ireland that they have had recent involvement in the funding decision process for the ORIS and that the Department of Rural and Community Development has been working closely with CARA to develop grant guidelines in relation to infrastructure development for people with a disability. These guidelines were developed in line with the 'A Guide for Accessibility' document which was developed by the Irish Wheelchair Association in collaboration with Sport Ireland, and delivered online by CARA. </p></reply>

The decision was reached by consensus at the beginning of May to cancel Irish language courses in the Gaeltacht for this summer after I initiated a public consultation process involving discussions with key stakeholders within the sector, including the residential accommodation providers, to hear their opinions and recommendations on the matter.</p><p>Having had the opportunity to listen carefully to the representative group of Gaeltacht households who provide accommodation for the sector, as well as other key stakeholders, I am well aware of the particular challenges facing Gaeltacht communities.</p><p>As this is the second successive year that COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of the Irish language colleges for the summer, an increase of 25% over the amount paid in 2020 under a similar measure is being provided under this measure to over 700 qualifying householders who provide accommodation to students attending Irish language colleges each summer.</p><p>This ultimately means that a payment of &euro;5 per student will be provided instead of &euro;4 - as provided under last year&rsquo;s measure. I might add that the measure has been broadly welcomed by the sector.</p><p>The objective of this funding is to ensure the continued viability of the sector and, as such, to allow it to continue to contribute to the systematic effort being made to support the Irish language and the Gaeltacht regions in line with overarching objectives as set out in the Government&rsquo;s 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and the accompanying 5-Year Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022.</p><p>The projected expenditure under this measure is set out in the table below per Gaeltacht region:  <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>No of SFG households 2019</th>       <th>No of SFG students 2019</th>       <th>Projected Expenditure 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>191 </td>       <td>5,445 </td>       <td>&euro;402,293 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>44 </td>       <td>3,278 </td>       <td>&euro;177,743 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>391 </td>       <td>12,660 </td>       <td>&euro;1,279,818 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>9 </td>       <td>257 </td>       <td>&euro;22,300 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>47 </td>       <td>3,328 </td>       <td>&euro;238,540 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>451 </td>       <td>&euro;24,625 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>1,258 </td>       <td>&euro;62,860 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>712 </td>       <td>26,677 </td>       <td>&euro;2,208,178 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I hope this information serves to clarify matters. </p></reply>

In September 2020, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce submitted a Recovery Plan to me which sets out a number of recommendations, including a recommendation on enhancing sustainable employment, aimed at helping the tourism sector to survive and recover from the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Extending the wage support measures was an important step in assisting tourism businesses with staff retention. Funding of &euro;5 million was also provided to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in Budget 2021 for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p>  <p>  The Tourism &amp;amp; Hospitality Careers Oversight Group (COG), chaired by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is a collaborative approach by stakeholders, including Industry Bodies, Education Providers, Government Departments and State Agencies, to addressing Skills Shortages in the Tourism Sector. The Group is currently finalising a new plan that takes into account recommendations from the Tourism Recovery Taskforce. A feasibility study of the proposed National Tourism Education Gateway has also been initiated. The Careers Oversight Group organised a Recruitment for Reopening Webinar Event at the end of April for tourism and hospitality businesses.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland are currently running a social media campaign targeting job seekers. A schedule of targeted content will run through the summer on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism careers website to push the job opportunities available. As part of its suite of Covid 19 business supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides HR advice and practical information for businesses. From employee well-being to temporary closures, these tailored supports help focus on restoring stability to businesses and supporting their employees.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also created an extensive range of business supports to support Ireland&rsquo;s tourism and hospitality businesses to survive, re-open and recover from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD and Minister of State for Skills, Niall Collins TD  announced two new skills programmes in February to assist hospitality and tourism sectors with COVID-19 challenges. Both programmes are aimed at assisting recovery and growth in the hospitality and tourism sector. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Minister of State for Skills also launched an Action Plan for Apprenticeships in April 2021. This is a five year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on tourism and hospitality and in the context of the National Economic Recovery Plan will consider further targeted measures to assist these sectors to recover.   </p></reply>

Such decisions will be based on public health advice and will be framed to respond effectively to the prevailing pandemic circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the physical and mental health benefits associated with fitness training. From the 7th  of June, individual indoor sports training in gyms and other such facilities has accordingly been permitted. This includes one-to-one instruction. While individual indoor training activity is permitted, indoor group exercise classes, games, matches or competitions are not. </p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, I would add that the total numbers currently permitted in a given indoor facility for individual training takes cognisance of social distancing and is dependent on the capacity of that facility to fully comply with the public health requirements and associated protocols developed by the relevant sporting bodies and organisations. Further information and advice in this regard is available from those bodies and organisations which remain in a close and ongoing engagement with Sport Ireland.</p></reply>

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr. Denis McCarthy and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The report of the expert panel was published on 13 June 2017. It concluded that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite.</p>  <p>  On the 31 January 2020, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, made Regulations to provide for a grant scheme to support affected homeowners in Donegal and Mayo. The Department subsequently prepared and issued guidelines on the operation of the scheme to both Councils to assist them in the administration of the scheme. The scheme opened for applications in June 2020. </p>  <p>  The resulting Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme is a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowner(s) to remediate their dwelling, where their dwelling has been damaged by the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction. The grant scheme applies to the owners of dwellings (located in Donegal or Mayo), which are damaged due to defective concrete blocks containing excessive amounts of deleterious materials namely mica or pyrite. The dwelling must be the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  The goal of the grant scheme is to help a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable option to remediate their home. It is not a compensation scheme but a mechanism for the State to help ordinary homeowners to remediate defects to their principal private residence and return their homes to the condition they would have been in had they not been built with defective concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage 475 stage one applications (377 in Donegal and 98 in Mayo) have been submitted and nearly 70% have been approved.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns about the scheme which have been raised by homeowners I established a time-bound working group, with representatives from my Department, the local authorities and homeowner representative groups, to review any outstanding issues in relation to the operation of the scheme, including issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering and allowable costs etc. I expect that the review, to be undertaken by the working group, will be completed by 31 July and will inform any changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required. Following receipt of the report of the working group I will, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, bring proposals in this regard to Government.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage I do not have an overarching responsibility for the State's property portfolio. Consideration in regard to the wider impact of defective concrete blocks on public buildings would be a matter for the relevant Department or the Office of Public Works. </p></reply>

Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013  each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. </p><p>In 2020, in order to strengthen the market surveillance function, I appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority, under the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020, for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. </p><p>As part of the Building Control Reform Agenda the National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was created to provide oversight, support and direction for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. The NBCMP is managed by the National Building Control Office (NBCO) within Dublin City Council (DCC) through the five pillars of:</p><p><b>1. Training:</b>This includes the coordination, development and management of a trainingprogramme to support building control staff in the discharge of their  duties.  </p><p><b>2. Inspections:</b>This includes the development and implementation of a robust and consistent inspection regime in the 31 Building Control Authorities to facilitate meaningful risk-based targeted inspections of building  works. </p><p><b>3. Compliance Support:</b>This includes the provision of oversight and support across the full suite of Building Control Legislation to ensure transparent, professional enforcement of the relevant legislation in accordance with proper public administration.</p><p><b>4. Information System - Building Control Management System (IS-BCMS):</b>This includes the development and management of the nformation technology-based system hosted by the Local Government Management Agency which facilitates the electronic administration of building control matters by building control authorities as the preferred means of building control administration.</p><p><b>5. Market Surveillance:</b>Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit was established in 2020 (following DCCs appointment as a competent authority). This service delivered by DCC-NBCO is complementary to the existing role of the 31 Building Control Authorities as Market Surveillance Authorities. Building control authorities liaise with the DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p><p>The National Building Control Advisory Committee oversees the NBCMP. My Department meets regularly with the NBCO and is represented on all of the associated committees and working groups.</p><p>In 2016, to support and empower Building Control Authorities (BCAs) in carrying out their duties across a range of legislation including building control, construction product and market surveillance legislation in a standardised and consistent way, a guidance document was produced, &lsquo;Framework for Building Control Authorities&rsquo;.</p><p>In 2020, my Department provided a budget allocation of &euro;500,000 to support the development of this Market Surveillance Unit.  &euro;147,000 of the budget was expended as the project was at the early development set up phase.  In 2021, my Department has provided a budget allocation of &euro;564,000 to continue to support the development, and resourcing of the Market Surveillance Unit.</p><p>Pursuant to Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) 765/2008, Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p><p>In 2019, my Department issued &lsquo;Guidelines for local authorities in the preparation of their Corporate Plans 2019-2024&rsquo;. The corporate plan serves as the local authority&rsquo;s strategic framework for action over the duration of the plan. These guidelines emphasise the importance of the Building Control function to ensure safe and sustainable buildings in urban and rural areas and highlights the key responsibilities for Building Control, including monitoring compliance with Building Regulations, Building Control Regulations, Construction Products Regulation and Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. </p><p>Building control authorities are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers. Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.</p></reply>

I consider it crucial that the views of our young people are properly and carefully considered in determining how we approach the biodiversity crisis in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN agreement that underpins global biodiversity policy, on developing and reaching agreement on a new Global Biodiversity Framework. This new Framework should be presented at the next Conference of the Parties to the CBD (COP15), which is due to be held in China later this year. It will set out the targets and actions agreed on among Parties, including Ireland, to respond to the biodiversity crisis over the next decade. </p>  <p>  Linkages between global biodiversity policies and issues around sustainable development, Just Transition, the concerns of local and indigenous communities, gender inequalities, as well as the needs of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), are an important aspect of the discussions taking place at international level. </p>  <p>  Ireland's next National Biodiversity Action Plan is due to be published in 2022 and will be informed by the objectives of the new Framework. It would be useful if the Citizens' Assembly was also scheduled so that its discussions can respond to the new global policy framework for biodiversity and help inform Ireland's role in it.  </p>  <p>  I do not envisage that a date for the Assembly will be set before the D&aacute;il Summer Recess.</p></reply>

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.</p><p>If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household.</p><p>The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, and maintenance payments received is assessable. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.<b></b></p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.</p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases taking effect inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted for all, apart from the most vulnerable tenants.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) and subsequently, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provide that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during, or in respect of any part of, the period from 1 August 2020 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears served in respect a tenant protected under the PDRTA must provide 90 days notice (rather than the usual 28 days notice) or specify a termination date of 13 January 2022 (whichever is later).</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 9 July 2021, provides for an extension of the enhanced protections under the PDRTA until 12 January 2022.</p><p>Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. The RTB acknowledge receipt of the warning notice to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available.</p><p>These measures are designed to prompt early engagement to deal with any rent arrears situation arising. Further information is available at www.rtb.ie. </p><p>Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period.</p><p>Tenants are required to continue to observe the normal terms and conditions of their tenancy including paying rent to their landlord during any emergency period. In the event of a tenant having difficulty meeting their legal obligation to pay rent due, he or she is encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity. The tenant may also wish to contact the Department of Social Protection, the RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to obtain the State supports available.</p><p>The protections under the PDRTA do not apply to a tenant who owed an amount of rent equal to 5 or more months&rsquo; rent on 10 January 2021 or builds rent arrears to such an amount.  The PDRTA provides for a number of scenarios, set out at the weblink below under which a landlord can make a declaration to the RTB and to the tenant with the effect that the PDRTA protections cease to apply in respect of the tenant - https://www.rtb.ie/emergency-measures-ended-new-protections-introduced-for-the-rental-sector/latest-rent-arrears-procedures-requirements-and-protections - including where their application would cause undue financial hardship to the landlord.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive which sets out requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water with the objective of protecting the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges.</p><p>The EPA is the key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges. </p><p>Given the role assigned to Irish Water, my Department  does not compile information in the specific format that the Deputy has requested.

This two-tiered approach requires that the development plan must identify &lsquo;Tier 1&rsquo; or serviced zoned land which comprises lands that are able to connect to existing development services, i.e. road and footpath access including public lighting, foul sewer drainage, surface water drainage and water supply, for which there is service capacity available, and can therefore accommodate new development.</p><p>The plan may also identify &lsquo;Tier 2&rsquo; or serviceable zoned land which comprises lands that are not currently sufficiently serviced to support new development but have potential to become fully serviced within the life of the plan i.e. the lands are currently constrained due to the need to deliver some or all development services required to support new development, such as, road or footpath access including lighting, foul sewer drainage, surface water drainage, water supply and/or additional service capacity.</p><p>The potential for delivery of the required services and/or capacity to support new development must be identified and this infrastructural assessment must be aligned with the approved infrastructural investment programme of the relevant delivery agency, for example, Irish Water, or be based on a written commitment by the relevant delivery agency to provide the identified infrastructure within a specified timescale (i.e. within the lifetime of the plan).  </p><p>To align with the national planning framework, Irish Water takes account of and supports ongoing work on the implementation of the framework, including the regional spatial and economic strategies. It liaises closely with local authorities to inform ongoing reviews of county development plans, local area plans and its waste water capacity registers, which help ensure the right development is supported in the right place.</p><p>For the information of the Deputy, it should be noted that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU Directives and national regulations for wastewater discharges to water bodies.</p><p>While my Department does not compile the information that the Deputy has requested, the EPA&rsquo;s recent report on the performance of urban waste water treatment in 2019, highlights the number of large towns and cities that now meet the required EU standards for waste water discharges.

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr. Denis McCarthy and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The report of the expert panel was published on the 13th June 2017. It concluded that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite.</p>  <p>  On the 31 January 2020, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, made Regulations to provide for a grant scheme to support affected homeowners in Donegal and Mayo. The Department subsequently prepared and issued guidelines on the operation of the scheme to both Councils to assist them in the administration of the scheme. The scheme opened for applications in June 2020. </p>  <p>  The goal of the grant scheme is to help a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable option to remediate their homes. It is not a compensation scheme but a mechanism for the State to help ordinary homeowners to remediate defects to their principal private residence and return their homes to the condition they would have been in had they not been built with defective concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage 475 stage one applications (377 in Donegal and 98 in Mayo) have been submitted and nearly 70% have been approved.</p></reply>

That situation will change if the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme is extended to other local authority areas and a process exists for individual local authorities to take a lead in this regard. </p>  <p>  My Department is in ongoing engagement with local authorities and local action groups that are currently within the scope of the scheme and with the relevant local authorities in respect to  discussions on requests for an extension of the scheme to other counties.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns being raised about the scheme by homeowners in Donegal and Mayo, I established a time bound working group to review the issues of concern and report to me with recommendations by 31 July 2021. Membership of the working group comprises of three homeowners from Donegal, three homeowners from Mayo, three officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, one official each from Donegal and Mayo County Council and a Housing Agency representative. Many stakeholders sought admittance onto the working group including public representative and engineers. In order to keep the group manageable in the context of a time bound period for reporting, the group was limited to 12. For that reason homeowner representation was restricted to Donegal and Mayo. I am satisfied that the homeowners of Donegal and Mayo, who make up 50% of the working group, can adequately represent the views of all homeowners who may be affected, regardless of their location.</p></reply>

The result of this was that the Interim Report was never deemed completed. Subsequently, the Chair of the Committee completed his tenure and stepped down to pursue other work and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) resources were primarily focused on the urgent need to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>Through the work of the recently appointed Chairperson to the Committee it is clear that the recommendations in the Interim Report are finally agreed and my Department will now assess those recommendations and determine the resource and other implications (including financial and legal) with a view to putting a plan in place to action them where appropriate. Advice and input will also be sought from the European Commission. These four sets of minutes and the two reports will be published imminently on the NPWS website. </p><p>The Urban Gulls Consultative Committee had presentations from the following expert individuals:</p><p>-  23rd October 2019 - Associate Professor Barry McMahon on Gulls and Public Health</p><p>-  23rd October 2019 - Peter Rock, UK Expert on Gulls on Managing Urban Gull Populations</p><p>-  25th November 2019 - Dr Gary Goggins, Environmental Sociologist (NUIG) on The Use of Participatory Approaches for Addressing Human-Environment Concerns</p><p>-  4th February 2020 - Dr Dearbhaile Morris on The AREST (Anti-microbial resistance and the Environment &ndash; Sources, Persistance, Transmission and Risk Management) Project</p><p>Minister O'Brien took all of the information available into account when making the decision to sign the Wild Birds Declaration 2021/22, including the views of the above experts.</p></reply>

Section 42 of the Act currently enables the holder of a planning permission to apply to a planning authority for an extension to the period of permission by an additional period not exceeding 5 years. </p>  <p>  If an extension to planning permission has been previously granted, the only circumstance in which the holder of a planning permission may be granted a further extension of duration is under section 42(1A) of the Act in respect of a development that relates to 20 or more houses, where substantial works have been carried out, subject to the development being completed within 5 years of the originally extended permission or by 31 December 2021 (as extended by Government Orders under Section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in 2020), whichever first occurs.</p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021 ('the 2021 Act') provides a temporary provision allowing for applications for further extensions of planning permissions which have already availed of an extension under section 42, or otherwise under section 42(1A), and in circumstances where no further extension is permissible. Where an application is made to a planning authority for a further extension, pursuant to the 2021 Act amendments, setting out the reasons why a development cannot be reasonably completed within the appropriate period as already extended, the planning authority shall further extend that period by an additional period of up to 2 years or until 31 December 2023, whichever first occurs, subject to the planning authority being satisfied of a number of matters, including that the development has commenced, substantial works have been carried out and that the extension is required to enable the development to be completed. This is subject also to the planning authority being satisfied that environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment would not be required for the proposed extension of the appropriate period.</p>  <p>  The specific number of housing projects which will be affected by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021 is not available in my Department. It is not be possible for me to speculate as to the number of housing projects, which have already availed of an extension under section 42, or further extension under section 42(1A), and which will also avail of a further extension under the amendments introduced by the 2021 Act. Rather, it will be a matter for the relevant planning authority to determine whether the conditions for granting a further extension are satisfied on a case by case basis. In other words, this provision does not provide a blanket extension of duration for a certain class or classes of developments, but rather must be determined on a case by case basis by the relevant planning authority upon application to that authority.</p>  <p>  It is case that construction work has been significantly impacted, with both delays and site closures throughout 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated restrictions, and most recently with the closure of non-essential construction sites on the 8 January 2021, which sites could only have reopened in April and May of this year at earliest. It is therefore envisaged that an additional extension of 2 years or until 31 December 2023, which ever first occurs, is an appropriate period to address the disruption and delays to construction caused by Covid-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions. This period not only takes into account the period of restrictions on construction, but also addresses delays and disruptions in logistics, supply chains, and the availability of personnel when restarting construction work after the mandatory and unplanned closure of building sites over the last year. </p></reply>

Under the Act, local authorities are, in general, liable for residential properties under their ownership in the same way as any other residential property owner. Local authorities value their residential properties in lowest Valuation Band (&euro;0 - &euro;100,000) for the liability date of 1 May 2013. This gives rise to an annual liability of &euro;90, subject to any 'local adjustment factor' to the LPT basic rate by the relevant Local Authority.</p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and since then the overall principles and allocation methodology have broadly remained the same. 80% of LPT is retained in the area it is collected, with the other 20% supporting equalisation for local authorities with LPT bases lower than their funding baseline.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p></reply>

The Placefinder service provides all local authorities with the option to pay a deposit and advance rental payment, where necessary, in order to secure a property. </p><p>In addition my Department provides funding towards Threshold, the housing charity, which provides advice and support to households living in private rented accommodation who are experiencing tenancy problems, including where a tenancy is at risk of termination. The Tenancy Protection Service operated by Threshold seeks to protect existing tenancies, keeping people in their home and prevent them from having to access homeless services. </p><p>It is also open to anyone to apply for social housing support, applications for which are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. To qualify for social housing support a household must meet all of the eligibility criteria, which primarily relate to income, availability of alternative accommodation and previous rent arrears.</p><p>Where a household is deemed to meet the eligibility criteria, only then is its housing need assessed under the criteria in Regulation 23 of the 2011 Regulations, having regard to its current accommodation.  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.</p><p>Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Comprehensive information including guidance and frequently asked questions documents in relation to tenancy terminations during the Covid-19 pandemic and on general tenancy matters is available on the RTB's website - <i>www.rtb.ie</i>. A tenant or a landlord may refer a matter to the RTB for its dispute resolution services. </p></reply>

The Department of Agriculture monitors conditions and issues colour-coded warnings during periods when wildland fire risk is high. Despite the success of "controlled burning" initiatives, regrettably, wildfires can also occur as a result of carelessness and deliberate setting of fires.  </p>  <p>  The priority of fire services in responding to wildland fires is the protection of life and health in local communities. Smoke can impact significantly on those with underlying breathing issues.  An important secondary objective is working with local communities to try to protect infrastructure, houses and other property, as well as conservation areas, which are threatened. Fire services work with a range of bodies including National Parks and Wildlife Services and Coillte as well as farming communities to minimise damage where it is safe to do so. Fighting wildland fires is difficult and, in all cases, fire services will prioritise safety of community and  emergency responders.   </p>  <p>   As well as the normal fire service response arrangements through which an incident commander can request additional resources in light of the situation, there are arrangements for mutual support across local authority fire services. Also, the response to wildfires is supported by well established arrangements whereby local authority fire services may, through the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) in my Department and working with the Department of Defence, request the assistance of the Defence Forces. The support provided to local authority fire services by the Defence Forces in wildland fire-fighting has been effective and is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>  Considerable inter-agency efforts have been made to reduce the incidence of wildland fires, led by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As noted above his Department monitors conditions and issues wildland fire warning notices. That Department has led an inter-agency review which has helped enhance the mitigation of wildland/ gorse fires. It is imperative that communities and relevant bodies continue to work together to seek to prevent and control wildland fires which threaten life, property and eco-sensitive areas. </p></reply>

The average cost of all long term leases approved in 2021 is &euro;17,115. In a Part V leased unit, the lease payment can vary greatly depending on how the equivalent net monetary value has been reflected in the agreement. This is usually achieved by either a rent free period up front or a discount on the lease payment over the term of the lease (or part thereof).  When this is taken into account, it is estimated that the average cost of Part V lease units approved to date in 2021 is &euro;17,512 annually over the term of the lease.  It is important to note that the Part V leased units approved to date in 2021 are largely in Dublin. The average lease cost will vary having regard to the location of the dwelling, size and the property type.  </p></reply>

It is not a compensation scheme and is very much a scheme of last resort for homeowners who have no other practical options to remediate their homes.</p>  <p>  The Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme was informed by the report of an Expert Panel which was published in 2017 which involved extensive research, investigations and analysis.  Any consideration of extension to the Defective Concrete Blocks Grants Scheme would, in the first instance, require the relevant local authority to conduct the same rigorous analysis as that carried out in Donegal and Mayo. </p>  <p>  The relevant local authority can take the lead to first of all demonstrate that the purported issues in Limerick are in fact due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks as set out in the I.S.465 protocol, and secondly to quantify the extent of the problem in the area. This would provide the evidential basis necessary for the consideration of any extension of the scheme and would be very helpful to the Department in its deliberations.  </p>  <p>  Preliminary discussions have taken place between my Department Officials and Limerick City and County Council, however my Department has yet to receive a formal submission on this matter from the Council. Pending the receipt of and consideration of such analysis it would be premature to consider an extension of the scheme. Any extension of the scheme  would also have to be the subject of budgetary discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department has recently extended the Pyrite Remediation Scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under that Scheme. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-13a.938.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021071300086#WRT02200"><p>Action 29 of the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 commits to progressing the accessibility of voting and voter information, building on learning from National Disability Authority research and from best practice. I am pleased to report good progress in addressing matters in this area. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, my Department formed a Working Group on Disability Voting to bring together representatives of the Department, persons with disabilities and representative organisations such as the National Disability Agency, the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Wheelchair Association. The Group is working to improve accessibility of voting for voters with physical disabilities, and its work has been particularly focused on the following issues:</p>  <p>  Improving accessibility to polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, with the goal of all polling stations being fully accessible as soon as possible;</p>  <p>  Reviewing and updating, as required, the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Accessible Voting Checklist&rsquo;, which addresses improved accessibility within polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users; </p>  <p>  Developing and improving Ballot Paper Templates (BPTs) - plastic devices with tactile features which are overlaid on ballot papers to enable blind and vision-impaired people to vote in private at electoral events; and</p>  <p>  Promoting measures to advance voting accessibility, as set out in Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  BPTs were used for the first time at the Referendum held in May 2018 and have been in use in all other electoral events since then. Good progress has also been made in recent years by Returning Officers in reducing the number of polling stations that are not fully accessible by voters with physical disabilities. </p>  <p>  Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts provide for a range of measures to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities, including:</p>  <p>  The requirement on local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be accessible to wheelchair users;</p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to  wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps;</p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement;</p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users. </p>  <p>  If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal or special voters list, a person must apply to the appropriate local authority by 25 November each year. After that date, an application for inclusion on the supplement to the postal or special voters list may be made. In addition, electoral law provides that voters who are unable to vote without assistance may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the Presiding Officer. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future - commits to the establishment of an Electoral Commission. In January 2021, the General Scheme of an Electoral Reform Bill was published which sets out the legislative basis for the Commission. The Commission will strengthen our electoral system as a whole and help us to anticipate and respond to the challenges we face in our evolving electoral environment. One of the Commission&rsquo;s key functions will be a public awareness and education role in respect of electoral events. </p>  <p>  While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department will continue to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.</p></reply>

While the vast majority of herders are Muslim and many of the farmers are Christian, the roots of this violence lie primarily in access to land, in the context of scarce natural resources due to rapid climate change in the Sahel. The clashes have been aggravated in recent years by rapid population growth in Africa's most populous country.</p>  <p>  Ireland works with the Nigerian authorities, as a European Union Member State, and with UN partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups and insecurity. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Abuja actively monitors developments in country, advises on the humanitarian response, advocates for the protection of human rights, and supports Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN forums. Over the past number of years, Ireland has provided humanitarian funding to support those affected by conflict. Ireland also provides funding to the Institute for Integrated Transitions, an NGO working in Nigeria, which has assisted in the establishment of an inter-ethnic and inter-religious committee on long term solutions to ethnic, religious, and resource based violence, including conflict between sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja continues to closely follow developments in Nigeria in cooperation with Government authorities, civil society organisations, and our EU and UN partners. The Department of Foreign Affairs is committed to continuing to provide much needed support and assistance to people in Nigeria who are working for peace and stability.</p></reply>

The Regime provides the EU with a concrete tool to target those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses, wherever they might occur, including in States not currently subject to a specific sanctions regime. </p>  <p>  The framework for targeted restrictive measures applies to acts such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and other serious human rights violations or abuses (including torture, slavery, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests or detentions). Other human rights violations or abuses can also fall under the scope of the sanctions regime, where those violations or abuses are widespread, systematic, or are otherwise of serious concern as regards the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU.</p>  <p>  To date, sanctions in the form of travel bans and the freezing of assets/funds have been imposed on a broad list of individuals and entities involved in human rights abuses, drawn from six different jurisdictions: China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Russia, Libya and South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland implements UN and EU sanctions, but does not have any unilateral sanctions regimes of its own. UN and EU sanctions, including the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, are given effect in Ireland through EU Council Decisions and Regulations. </p>  <p>  These designations send a strong message that the EU is willing to act tangibly and directly to confront serious human rights violations, when other efforts have not brought about the desired change of behaviour.</p></reply>

In response to the shocking events that took place on 5 July Ireland joined a statement from the EU Delegation to Georgia and over 20 Embassies and Missions, condemning the violent attacks, as well as the failure of the Government leaders and religious officials to protect the constitutional rights of their citizens. Ireland also highlighted our concerns through the Department of Foreign Affairs Twitter account while the events were still unfolding. </p>  <p>  Our focus on the LGBTI+ rights in Georgia is longstanding. We have serious concerns about the security of the LGBTI+ persons there, not only because of the recent events preventing the Tbilisi Pride March for Dignity. Ireland raised the issue of LGBTI+ rights at the 37th session of the Universal Periodic Review Working Group Review of Georgia in January this year stating: &ldquo;Ireland is concerned about LGBTI+ rights, hate crimes and the administration of justice in Georgia,&rdquo; and recommended that the Georgian authorities &ldquo;ensure the prevention, investigation and prosecution of hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression by establishing an effective hate crime investigation unit within the law enforcement system.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned by the apparent failure of the Georgian authorities to make clear their opposition to homophobic rhetoric and their unwillingness to guarantee the safety of IDAHO and Pride gatherings that are devoted to tolerance. LGBTI+ persons should be able to enjoy their constitutional rights such as participation in peaceful gatherings without fear of persecution.  Ireland expects that the perpetrators of these violent attacks will be brought to justice. </p></reply>

Last year alone ESP grants totalling around &euro;13 million assisted over 400 projects run by nearly 300 different organisations, the vast majority grassroots-based.</p>  <p>  These range in scale from large-scale welfare support programmes in cities like New York, Boston and London to smaller events run by Irish community organisations in countries like Kenya and Malaysia. As well as these community groups, support is also provided to sporting, cultural and heritage organisations such as the GAA and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for their Global activities. The ESP includes capital grants for the maintenance and development of Irish community centres and for innovative projects such as the prestigious, new Irish Arts Centre in New York. It also encompasses support to Irish emigrants looking to return home through the Back for Business programme and to organisations such as Crosscare and the Citizens Information Bureau. In recent years, it has also fostered business networks and connected those networks across the globe. </p>  <p>  The Programme has been of vital importance during COVID-19, allowing us to establish the COVID Response Fund - specifically tailored to help Irish communities across the globe stay connected and to work collectively to protect our most vulnerable emigrants. The positive impact that this Fund has made will be continued in this year's round of ESP allocations.</p>  <p>  The Emigrant Support Programme is the front-facing part of a wider, new Diaspora Strategy which was launched by the Government last November.</p>  <p>  The new Strategy takes account of evolving circumstances and needs and sets out a number of guiding principles and initiatives to strengthen the relationship between Ireland and our diaspora. It is more inclusive and reflects the rich diversity of our global community. It also embraces the reverse diaspora of people who have lived, studied or worked in Ireland before returning to their home countries as well as the affinity diaspora who hold a deep appreciation for our people, places and culture. </p>  <p>  The new strategy has been shaped by contributions from hundreds of individuals and organisations both in Ireland and in Irish communities around the world. This engagement continues and will, I hope, help shape and strengthen the Emigrant Support Programme in the years ahead so that it continues to be something in which we as people - whether at home or abroad - can be justly proud. </p></reply>

This is an effort to which I am committed.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Affairs Ministers met with the new Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid on 12 July. During our discussion I underlined that all unilateral actions which can increase tension must be avoided and that settlement expansion and ongoing threats of evictions, demolitions and violence against Palestinians, all of which undermine prospects for peace, must be stopped.  I called on Israel to do all it can to address the humanitarian situation and support reconstruction in Gaza. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-State solution based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.</p>  <p>  I will continue to highlight this issue at the UN and through the EU and to support international efforts to ensuring the current ceasefire holds.</p></reply>

Many of the countries on the Security Council agenda face serious human rights challenges, while UN Peacekeeping Operations and Special Political Missions play an essential role in protecting civilians and promoting respect for human rights. </p>  <p>  To date, this month alone, Ireland has highlighted human rights concerns in meetings on Ethiopia (Tigray), the Democratic Republic of Congo, as co-penholder in relation to the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel, and crucially as co-penholder on negotiations to extend the mandate for the critical cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria.</p>  <p>  At the 47th session of the Human Rights Council which concludes this week, Ireland again led on negotiating a resolution to protect civil society space, while also delivering national statements on a number of country-specific human rights situations including Belarus, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Myanmar, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Ukraine. Ireland also delivered statements on a number of thematic human rights issues including violence against women, human trafficking, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. </p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland is an active participant in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, working globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security. Human Rights issues feature prominently at the meetings I attend at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. In addition, my officials engage extensively on human rights issues at the relevant Council-level working parties including on the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassies also engage actively in EU led Human Rights dialogues and through financial support from Irish Aid in relevant countries.</p></reply>

We believe that, as a court of last resort, the ICC does not substitute for national judicial systems &ndash; States bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports efforts towards the universality of the Rome Statue and we constantly seek opportunities to promote this. We, however, also respect the decision of any State not to become a State Party, including the United States. Non-States Parties can nonetheless support the fight against impunity and the role of the Court, as has been done under previous US administrations. I am encouraged by the positive approach of the current US Administration to international criminal justice and accountability.</p>  <p>  Ireland, alongside other EU Member States, continues to regularly engage with the US Administration on a range of matters of international law, including the International Criminal Court. Ireland welcomed the decision by the United States to revoke Executive Order 13928 and thus to lift the sanctions against senior ICC personnel. We also welcomed the termination of the separate 2019 policy on visa restrictions on certain ICC personnel.</p>  <p>  There are many examples of good cooperation between the US and the ICC, such as US assistance in arresting individuals indicted by the Court. Ireland and our EU partners appreciate our continuing discussions with the United States on how we can enhance cooperation and minimise any differences in our approach. The Biden Administration&rsquo;s demonstrated interest in re-engaging with multilateralism, including with the International Criminal Court, is heartening, and we look forward to working with them on all multilateral issues.</p></reply>

This allocation provides for seven days annual paid training for each effective member of the AR and NSR.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically roll over into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in  the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met  within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars and are available on the Department's website.</p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that an SNA Exceptional Review application was submitted by Ballygiblin NS for the 2020/21 school year, which included the care needs of students enrolled in the school. The completion of the review necessitated a school visit which took place in April 2021.

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC with the next meeting scheduled for 30 July and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited. The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided.</p>  <p>  In processing applications for an exceptional review of SNA support, the NCSE considers each application on the basis of the information provided by the school. Schools are required to use their existing allocation and deploy SNAs in support of the care needs as they are currently presenting in the school. The NCSE examines the application to identify whether there has been a significant change in the profile of care needs in the school. In some cases an additional allocation is required and is subsequently made available to the school. As advised in the Guidelines on the SNA Exceptional Review process published on the NCSE website, priority is given to schools with no or limited SNA resources and to rapidly developing schools.</p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 Exceptional Review process, given the particular public health requirements and the fact that school buildings were closed for some of the year, wherever possible the opportunity was taken to conclude a review as an office based exercise. In most cases this resulted with the review being brought to a conclusion without a school visit. However, in some cases it was also necessary to visit the school in order to complete the process and 320 such school visits took place.  The school visit provides an opportunity to engage with teachers, SNAs and school management on the effective deployment of SNAs in the school and the NCSE is thankful to schools for facilitating their taking place. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have confirmed that 1,488 SNA Exceptional Review applications were received, and outcomes notified to schools. Of these, 772 schools received an increase amounting to 539.39 additional posts allocated. The number of appeals received was 137.</p></reply>

The Stay Safe programme is a personal safety skills programme for use with primary school children from Junior Infants through to 6th class. The programme seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protective skills by participation in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, inappropriate touch, secrets, telling and stranger danger. The programme aims to give children the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse/victimisation and teaches them that they should always tell (an adult that can help) about any situation which they find unsafe, upsetting, threatening, dangerous or abusive.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, two programmes are in place which come under the heading of Personal Safety. One of these programmes is for junior cycle which addresses personal safety in relationships and explores topics such as healthy and unhealthy relationships, consent and domestic gender-based and sexual violence. The other programme, which is for senior cycle, addresses topics such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, dating violence and rape. Both of these programmes were designed by the Professional Development Support Service (PDST) and are intended to be taught as part of the wider Social Personal and Health Education /Relationships and Sexuality Education curriculum. Professional development support is available to teachers, directly linked to these resources.    </p></reply>

The NCCA Subject Development group included IASTA. Integral to the specification development was the retention of the practical component, which is viewed as core to the subject. </p>  <p>  The core strand underpinning the specification is &ldquo;Scientific Practices&rdquo;, and the completion of the Individual Investigative Study is supported by this strand. The importance of this strand is demonstrated through the current award weighting of 25% of the total mark to the candidates for their Individual Investigative Study. The remaining 75% is awarded for their terminal written examination. </p>  <p>  The other 3 strands are broken into areas which are familiar to teachers: Soils, Crops and Animals, all of which were contained in the old curriculum. The format of the new agricultural science specification is based on learning outcomes rather than a list of content.   Teachers are being supported in engaging with a specification in this format through the Support Services CPD programme. Aligning relevant content from the old curriculum to that of the new specification will aid some teachers in their understanding of the learning outcomes and in turn will enable them to identify where the various cross cutting themes would be applicable.</p>  <p>  As such, I consider the  new agricultural science syllabus in place in secondary schools for the leaving certificate programme to be relevant, practical and of benefit to the learning outcomes of students.   </p></reply>

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students who were in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.</p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.   </p>  <p>  The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p>  <p>  Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools in relation to online and remote learning. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.</p>  <p>  On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. Following this meeting, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the Assessment Arrangements for Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Minor changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific to the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month.</p>  <p>  On the same date I also announced that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.  The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p>  <p>  Both the Calculated Grades and Accredited Grades processes were provided as exceptional measures in 2020 and 2021 respectively, recognising the sudden and very challenging position at that time and the impossibility of running examinations in their traditional form safely.   It is expected that there will not be the same disruption to learning in the coming school year and it is planned that the Leaving Certificate examinations will be held as normal next year.  </p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme is up to &euro;40 million, a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p><p>For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) are encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria have been extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools.</p><p>Based on the figures provided in these indications, a total of over 34,000 students could benefit from school-based programmes in 2021 nationally. This would be an increase of 161 per cent on actual take up in 2020. </p><p>Details of this breakdown are in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Provision Type </th>       <th>Number of Schools</th>       <th>Number of students to benefit in 2021</th>       <th>% increase on 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DEIS Literacy and Numeracy Camps: </td>       <td>230 (352 schemes but 122 schools are running more than   once in summer 2021)</td>       <td>11,000</td>       <td>57%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools and Special classes</td>       <td>408</td>       <td>6,482</td>       <td>66.5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Post Primary Inclusion Programme</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>7,854</td>       <td>250%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inclusion Programme primary</td>       <td>466</td>       <td>8,952</td>       <td>First time these students will be able to avail of a   school based programme</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total School-based provision</td>       <td>968 schools<br /><br />(1,346 schemes, some schools running more than one type).</td>       <td>34,288</td>       <td><br /><br />161%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>However, figures on actual participation for the school-based programme, including for pupils in Cork, will only become known when claim forms are received and processed over the summer period. </p><p>Similarly it will not be possible to provide figures for the number of applications for the home based summer scheme until the completed forms from the parents to confirm the programme has happened have been received and processed. As the home based programme can run throughout the summer the final forms may not be received until the closing date of 03 September 2021. The Department will have details on the numbers who participate in the home based scheme in late October/early November. The Department has received and is processing 13,800 applications for the supplementary programme which was put in place in February, and expects there will be continued demand for the home-based summer programme.</p><p>Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a Teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home in a private arrangement. Schools have been requested to assist parents in trying to source a teacher/SNA who meets the scheme criteria. This can be a member of the school staff or another teacher or SNA known to the school.</p><p>Where this is not possible, parents must source a teacher/SNA from outside of their school.</p><p>The Teaching Council and Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN) have been promoting the summer programme with this year&rsquo;s graduate teachers and Professional Masters of Education (PME) students to increase the supply of available teachers this summer.  The NCSE has also published information to assist parents in sourcing a teacher/SNA.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not</p><p>based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

School authorities can also apply to the Department for funding for capital improvement works in their schools. These include works related to the provision of facilities for pupils with Special Educational Needs, such as classrooms, resource rooms, multi-sensory areas, universal toileting, external play etc. These funding streams have been in operation for a number of years. </p>  <p>  My Department will ensure school building designs continue to consider the provisions of Universal Design and accessibility generally through its implementation of the Technical Guidance Documents as part of its ongoing annual capital building programme for both new and existing school buildings.  </p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>   All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  My Department recently commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme.  Following commencement of this review in February 2021 and a detailed analysis and report conducted by the Technical Working Group in the interim period, the Steering Group recently presented me with its initial interim report, a report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this report, I have approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures which allow for students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  This will result in transport being provided for an estimated additional 1,800 post-primary pupils in the 2021/2022 school year, who otherwise would not be accommodated under the scheme.  This arrangement will be in place for the coming school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>   Wider considerations relating to the objectives of the scheme and the criteria for eligibility will take place in the next phase of the review which is now underway.

This included &euro;50m in respect of the 2020-2021 school year brought forward and issued in December 2020. Schools were advised that they could use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning during the pandemic. Funding is paid to DEIS schools at a higher rate than non DEIS. The funding is intended to enable schools to implement their Digital Learning Plan through provision of appropriate infrastructure. This includes Desktop PCs, laptops, tablets or hybrid devices, projectors/flat screens, cloud-based tools and software applications, and learning platforms.  </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. </p>  <p>  Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. </p>  <p>  The Department spends just over &euro;150 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million, in the form of a DEIS grant was allocated to schools ahead of schedule for the 2020/21 school year. This is an annual grant to support learning in the context of DEIS for the academic year. In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme. </p>  <p>  The development of a new Digital Strategy is underway and an extensive consultation process has commenced with an open call for submissions. Further strands of the consultation will include questionnaires to key stakeholder and engagement through focus groups. A Consultative Advisory Group has been established comprising key stakeholders representing parents, teachers, students and industry. Future funding measures to support schools in embedding the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment will be considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

They cannot be included with the person&rsquo;s 226 paid full-rate contributions for calculation of pension entitlement.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified of this decision in writing on 19 November 2019. Following a requested review, this decision remained unchanged, and the person was advised accordingly on 11 March 2020.  Their appeal of this decision was disallowed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 27 July 2020.</p>  <p>  A combination of both PAYE and self-employed contributions can be considered for pension purposes, provided that self-employment contributions have been paid in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66 and all self-employment contributions payable have been paid.</p>  <p>  In order to be admitted as a voluntary contributor, 520 qualifying paid contributions are required, and an applicant must apply within 60 months of the end of the year in which they last paid or were credited a social insurance contribution prior to the year in which they wish to pay.  The person concerned cannot be accepted as a voluntary contributor, as they do not satisfy the eligibility conditions for the scheme.  The 60-month limit for application, as prescribed in social welfare legislation, has elapsed.  Voluntary Contributions cannot be awarded for a period where compulsory contributions were due.</p>  <p>  Compulsory Social Insurance (PRSI) for employees commenced in 1953 and for the self-employed in 1988. Refunds of PRSI arise when contributions from employers and employees have been paid in error, which is not the case for the person concerned, as compulsory PRSI was paid at the correct rate for the relevant periods of employment and self-employment.  The pension element of the contributions paid by both employed and self-employed contributors may be refunded in the case of contributors who entered insurable employment either as employees or self-employed after they had attained the age of 56 and who have no entitlement to either a State pension (contributory), or a State pension (non-contributory).  According to the records of my Department, the person concerned entered insurable employment on 13 July 1965, when they were 16 years of age. Therefore, the pension element of their contributions paid is not refundable.</p>  <p>  It remains open to the person concerned to apply for State pension (non-contributory).  On receipt of a completed application form, their eligibility for this pension can be determined and they will be notified in writing of the decision.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

It has been an important support for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families through COVID19.  To date, over &euro;8.2 billion has been paid out on PUP to nearly 900,000 recipients.   </p>  <p>  Thankfully, the  requirement for emergency measures such as the PUP is diminishing as people are vaccinated and increasing numbers return to work. That is why, in order to allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, it has been decided to phase the return to normal jobseeker arrangements over an extended period.  Accordingly  the PUP rates of payment will remain unchanged until September when they will commence a gradual reduction over 6 months back to standard jobseekers terms.   </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that our experience has shown that people are willing to return to work as restrictions are eased.  This confirms research by the ESRI that indicates that the vast majority of people choose to take up work rather than remain on welfare even in situations where the financial benefit of working is low or in some cases even when it is negative.  I also note that in a recent budget perspectives paper the ESRI pointed out that for most people income from employment will exceed the value of the PUP payment.  </p>  <p>  Where an employee closes their pandemic unemployment payment to return to work but has been temporarily placed on a shorter working week they may be entitled to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment or Short-Time Work Support. Short Time Work Support is a social insurance income support payment provided under Jobseeker's Benefit.  An individual&rsquo;s eligibility for Short Time Work Support is dependent on the extent to which their working days are reduced.  They must be temporarily working a standard reduced weekly work pattern, working 3 days or less per week having previously worked full time.  The payment is made in respect of the days of work that have been lost and is not taxable. </p>  <p>  Where a person is working part-time, up to 3 days per week, and does not have a standard work pattern they may be eligible for the social insurance based Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or the means tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for the days they are unemployed and not being paid.    </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

They are a contribution paid directly to the employer, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability. Rates of payment increase depending on the number of employees employed under the scheme. Incremental top up payments to the basic rate apply, starting at a 10% increase where there are 3 or more employees up to a 50% top up where 23 or more are employed, increasing the basic payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour.  Employers with 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme may also be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.</p><p>Expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme in 2020 was &euro;18.36 million &ndash; this was lower than the estimated expenditure for last year of &euro;24.55 million following a reduction in activity due to COVID-19 restrictions. </p><p>Estimated expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme in 2021 is expected to be almost &euro;26 million. </p><p>The additional cost in a full year to link the current rate of the Wage Subsidy at 55%, 60% and 65% of the national minimum wage, as proposed, are set out in tabular form below.</p><p>Please note that the figures provided in the table are estimated and based on the following:</p><p>-  The current number of 1,602 private sector employers availing of the subsidy in respect of some 2,539 participant employees. The Wage Subsidy Scheme is a demand-led scheme so the figures below take no account of behavioural impact e.g. where a new employer might apply for the  subsidy on account of an increased rate of subsidy.</p><p>-  The subsidy is available from between 21 and 39 hours per week and therefore employees&rsquo; hours vary. The costs provided are based on employees' current average hours across the subsidised range of 21-39.</p><p>-  The costs include Strand II and Strand III associated increases. </p><p>-  The increase is calculated from a baseline of &euro;23,142,129 based on current numbers.  <table>    <tr>       <th>%of National Minimum Wage (NMW)</th>       <th>Hourly Rate in &euro; </th>       <th>Additional Scheme Cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>55% of NMW</td>       <td>&euro;5.61</td>       <td>&euro;1,334,294</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>60% of NMW</td>       <td>&euro;6.12</td>       <td>&euro;3,529,424</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>65% of NMW</td>       <td>&euro;6.63</td>       <td>&euro;5,724,553</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This ensures that applicants can be assessed for any special reception needs before they are designated an accommodation centre. The IPAS works closely with the HSE screening team to ensure that International Protection applicants are moved, in so far as possible, to locations where their medical needs can be met. </p><p>Additionally, a Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by IPAS of my Department. The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February. The pilot will continue until end 2021, at which point it will be evaluated, and this will be used to inform the long term implementation of vulnerability assessments. </p><p>The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. </p><p>IPAS offers a vulnerability assessment to everyone who makes an application for international protection to the International Protection Office (IPO). Where an application includes children of an applicant, IPAS, with parental consent, also assess their vulnerability in an appropriate manner.</p><p>The Vulnerability Assessment begins with an initial interview after the applicant first applies for international protection.  If this initial assessment indicates that the applicant is a vulnerable person, within the meaning of the relevant EU Directive, further assessments may be carried out while the applicant is living in the IPAS Reception Centre, or subsequently when they have moved to longer term accommodation. </p><p>Taken together, these assessments are used to determine whether the applicant has special reception needs arising from any vulnerabilities identified. IPAS will endeavour to accommodate these needs in so far as possible.</p><p>It is important to note that services for all International Protection applicants (including health services) are mainstreamed. Protection applicants are linked with primary care services (GPs). They are entitled to a medical card while residing in International Protection accommodation and have a waiver of prescription charges.  Applicants access health services through the same referral pathways as Irish citizens including referral to disability and mental health services. Every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met.</p></reply>

The Group&rsquo;s membership is made up of relevant Government Departments and state agencies including the National Disability Authority and the National Transport Authority. The group met in March 2020 during which draft Terms of Reference and a work plan, including consultation process were discussed for future decision. However, following the emergence of COVID-19 the work of the group was paused to allow officials to focus on responding to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working to re-convene the Transport Working Group in the coming weeks. My Department is also in contact with the Department of Finance with a view to incorporating work planned by that Department in regard to reviewing transport supports for people with disabilities into the work of the NDIS Transport Working Group.  </p></reply>

These commissioned services fulfill Tusla's statutory responsibilities and deliver on the Agency's strategic objectives. These organisations operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for the recruitment of their employees and the terms and conditions under which they are employed. Some organisations were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014.</p>  <p>  Section 56(14) of the Act of 2013 stipulates that &lsquo;an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other.&rsquo; Tusla is not the employer of the staff of such organisations and the remuneration of these staff is a matter for their own employers.</p>  <p>  The Minister is committed to working with colleagues in government, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of voluntary organisations and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland.</p></reply>

In recent years, Tusla has substantially increased its funding allocation to Men's Aid, and began funding the Men's Development Network for the provision of services to male victims. The National Domestic Violence Helpline, run by Women&rsquo;s Aid, is also available to callers of all genders on a 24 hour basis. Tusla continues to keep the presenting needs of victims, both male and female, under ongoing review to ensure the needs of all victims are met in a holistic manner. </p>  <p>  All organisations working with victims of domestic violence seek to support someone at risk, regardless of gender or access to refuge. Refuges in Ireland are high support services that provide safe and short-term accommodation for women and children at high risk of harm from domestic violence. The current service model in Ireland is in line with many other countries, where victims of domestic violence have been identified to be predominantly women at risk of violence from men.</p>  <p>  Tusla is due to present a final draft of its strategic review of emergency accommodation to the Minister shortly. Tusla has advised that the accommodation needs of many cohorts were considered in its accommodation review, including men. It is expected that the findings of the review will recommend the future course of actions for Government with regard to current and future accommodation requirements for victims of domestic violence. These findings will be considered in conjunction with the audit of the responsibility for DSGBV across Government, and the Third National Strategy for DSGBV, which is under the remit of the Department of Justice and is currently in development. </p>  <p>  The Minister recognises that male victims of domestic violence experience particular difficulties that may differ significantly from those experienced by women, and that some men would undoubtedly benefit from access to refuge accommodation. The Minister has engaged with Men&rsquo;s Aid and other advocates in this area, and is open to further engagement with the sector on this issue as part of a broader consultation with regard to future actions in the Third National Strategy. Tusla will continue to engage with key stakeholders, and listen to the experiences of service providers that work with men, to determine the level of need for ongoing service provision.</p></reply>

This is particularly important to note given that a deceased applicant&rsquo;s family could potentially be in danger in their home country were such information to be published. </p>  <p>  In keeping with relevant provisions in the International Protection Act 2015 safeguarding the identity of protection applicants, and, out of respect for the deceased's next of kin, I can not comment further on the specific details of any such cases.  </p>  <p>  In the event of the death of a resident at a centre, a critical incident policy is in place to provide guidelines for staff in the  International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department (IPAS) and accommodation centre managers and staff.  IPAS officials work closely with the centre manager to assist the person&rsquo;s next of kin, if known, in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to offer supports to any residents affected by the death.  Where children are involved, the family is linked with Tusla to provide relevant supports.</p>  <p>  Under the Critical Incident Policy, any death or very serious incident that occurs within accommodation centres provided by the Department is referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and, where appropriate, the Garda&iacute; will in turn refer those deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  Where cause of death has not already been certified by a qualified medical practitioner, investigations and inquests into the cause of a death are matters for those authorities.?  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the formal registration and recording of all deaths in the State, including information on cause of death where known, rests with the General Register Office in the Department of Social Protection.  </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that since my response to the Deputy's correspondence on 3 March 2021 that the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department has developed a new policy on the collation and provision of statistics on deaths that occur at any of IPAS accommodation centres.  </p>  <p>  The policy, which came into effect on 1 June 2021, will be published on a new IPAS website due to launch in coming days.  The policy covers procedures to be followed with regard to notification of a death of a resident to IPAS and other relevant authorities, collation of statistics, and publication of information.   Alongside the policy, my Department will also be publishing statistical information on the deaths of residents going back to the earliest recorded death of a resident.  These statistics, which will include a breakdown by cause of death, where known, have been collated with the assistance of the General Register Office.</p></reply>

My Department officials are also made aware of occasional incidences by the centre management. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any premises whether residential or otherwise, there is always the possibility of intrusion by vermin.  </p><p>The requirement for inspection of dedicated accommodation centres is a contractual obligation for all service operators contracted by my Department. Accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by both my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) and an independent inspectorate company (QTS Ltd).  These inspections are generally undertaken, twice yearly by my officials in IPAS and once yearly by QTS Ltd.  </p><p>Inspectors examine all communal areas, bedrooms, kitchens and dining areas. Inspectors also examine occupancy registers, staffing records, health and safety documentation (including fire safety records), food preparation systems , menu cycles (in centres that provide full catering), facilities available to residents, information provision to residents and the condition of external grounds. </p><p>Evidence of any vermin infestation is also noted during the routine inspections by the centre management and by my officials or by QTS Ltd.  Where there is evidence of any vermin activity, this is dealt with appropriately by the centre management and further inspections may follow.  For example, where a cockroach infestation is found, a pest control company will be engaged to fog any affected rooms.  More than one intervention may be required to fully address the issue if evidence is found of eggs on cloting etc.  Residents of any affected room will be moved to another room until the situation is brought under control and the room is suitable for re-occupation.</p><p>Completed inspection reports are published on once the contractor has been given the opportunity to comment on the findings and, if necessary, indicate how and when any required remedial work has or will be undertaken.  </p></reply>

The health, both physical and psychological, of residents is paramount in doing so. </p><p>On a more general note,  I can assure the Deputy that the health and wellbeing of all people who avail of accommodation provided by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department is of the highest priority to myself and my officials.</p><p>A confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, this Department, was also established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents that are being accommodated by my Department.  This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).  Any isue raised through this service may be passed in confidence to IPAS for investigation and resolution.</p><p>Residents also have full access to the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children should they wish to lodge a complaint regarding any services provided by my Department or other State Agencies and Departments.</p></reply>

This scheme will include a restorative recognition payment and a form of enhanced medical card. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) was set up to develop detailed proposals for the Restorative Recognition Scheme, which must then be brought to Government for approval. While the IDG must take account of the recommendations of the Commission, its considerations are not limited to those recommendations. The work of the IDG is underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by consultation with survivors. </p>  <p>To support and inform the work of the IDG, a public consultation process took place during March and April. The input from survivors to that consultation is invaluable in order to develop a scheme that will have their needs at its core. I was delighted with the strong response to the consultation process with approximately 450 written submissions received and 17 online meetings held. The report of the consultation process was submitted to the IDG on the 17th May. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the IDG are working extremely hard to ensure that they deliver their report to me very soon. On receipt of this, I will submit recommendations to Government for a decision on the Scheme.  The development of this scheme, and the work being undertaken on all aspects of the Government's response to the Commission's Final Report, is a priority for me.</p></reply>

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service. The levels of support include:</p>  <p>  Universal supports (Levels 1-3)</p>  <p>  -  Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.</p>  <p>  -  Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County/City Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  -  Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).</p>  <p>  Targeted supports (Levels 4-7)</p>  <p>  -  Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  -  Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.</p>  <p>  -  Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  -  Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff / child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p>  <p>  In total, 15,321 children have so far benefited from targeted AIM supports since AIM began in 2016. In the 2020/21 ECCE programme year, 4,245 children have benefited from targeted AIM supports.</p>  <p>  The number of approvals for additional assistance under Level 7 of AIM rose from 3,011 in 2017 to 3,928 in 2018, and to a high of 4,657 in 2019. In 2020, the number fell to 2,868, due to service providers availing instead of Covid-19 financial support through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p>  <p>  The number of Inclusion Co-ordinators (INCOs) in early learning and care services, supported through AIM, has increased year on year from 749 in 2017, to 2,378 in 2021. </p>  <p>  An evaluation of AIM is currently under way. The final evaluation report is due at the end of the year.</p></reply>

The programme aims to provide young people with the knowledge, skills and confidence to participate fully in society and progress to further education, training and employment.  Certification is available to all learners in Youthreach mainly at levels 1-4 on the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) Framework.  </p><p>In 2018 SOLAS appointed the ESRI to complete an independent evaluation of the national Youthreach programme.  The report can be accessed here: <i>youthreach-evaluation-final-june-20019.pdf (solas.ie).</i>Work relating to Youthreach, as recommended in the ESRI&rsquo;s report, is currently underway and will involve consultation with stakeholders involved in Youthreach provision.</p><p>The staff cohort in Youthreach is made up of Youthreach Co-ordinators, Youthreach Resource Persons and teachers. Youthreach Co-ordinators and Resource Persons have their own terms and conditions, including rates of pay, which are set out in Youthreach-specific contracts. Youthreach Co-ordinators and Resource Persons are a separate and distinct grade to teachers.  Accordingly, they do not require to be registered with the Teaching Council, which is the body with statutory authority under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 for the professional regulation, including registration, of teachers in the State.  In addition, Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001 does not apply to Youthreach Centres as they do not fall within the definition of recognised school.</p><p>The Youthreach programme requires staff who are flexible, multi-disciplined and experienced. While relevant qualifications are desirable, no qualifications are specified for staff working in the programme.  This is intended to give ETBs maximum flexibility to recruit staff with the combination of personal qualities and professional skills most likely to meet the often complex needs of participating learners. </p><p>A union representing Youthreach Co-ordinators and Youthreach Resource Persons has submitted a claim in respect of both grades. Officials from my Department and the Department of Education are engaging with the trade union on this claim under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. This is the most appropriate place for that engagement to happen.</p></reply>

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  Particular priority is afforded to those on the lowest incomes and social welfare dependents through the special rate of grant, which is payable at the higher non-adjacent rate of &euro;5,915 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,375, depending on the distance travelled to the college attended. </p>  <p>  In assessing an application for the 2021/22 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant:</p>  <p>  1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p>  <p>  2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500;</p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2020, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021.</p>  <p>  As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the student grant scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  However, the Student Grant Scheme also makes provision for combining periods of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting the 391 days eligibility requirement for the special rate of grant. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances includes no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of students whose normal residence is 45km or less from the approved institution which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p>  <p>  The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for SUSI, the grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3) (a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the awarding authority shall establish:  </p>  <p>  -  the method for measuring a route; and </p>  <p>  -  the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p>  <p>  The distance is always measured from the student's normal residence to the campus the student is attending and never the reverse. The distance is always measured avoiding tolls. The 'depart at' time is set to 1am to ensure consistency by measuring each SUSI Applicant's adjacency at the same time, using Google Maps</p>  <p>  SUSI undertakes annual reviews of its processes to identify improvements in accuracy and consistency and have progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures was the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants.</p>  <p>  Some reviews can have positive outcomes for students and some reviews can be triggered by a change of address. At all times SUSI strives to ensure that each applicant receives the best possible outcome based on their particular set of circumstances. The application process for 2021-22 is still open therefore, it is not possible at this juncture to provide the data requested by the Deputy. However, I can confirm that as of July 11, SUSI had received just over 80,500 applications and assessed just over 56,500 with just over 49,500 qualifying for grant support.</p></reply>

Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 this arrangement will continue for the 25 apprenticeships which are currently covered under this process. Actions set out in the Plan will see employers of all other apprentices become eligible for an annual base grant paid per apprentice. The level of grant will be announced by year end. </p>  <p>  This will be supplemented by practical measures to support the employment of apprentices in SMEs, and additional financial and other measures to support the employment of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship and the delivery of skills essential to the economy. A new National Apprenticeship Office will make accessing information on, and engagement with, apprenticeship more straightforward for both learners and employers.  It will provide practical advice and support for the new consortia responsible for the delivery of apprenticeships at programme level. </p>  <p>  In the meantime the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been extended to include all apprentices registered to the end of this year to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery at the reopening of the economy following COVID-19.  The Scheme comprises a &euro;2,000 payment when employers register a new apprentice, followed by an additional &euro;1,000 payment one year later where that apprentice is retained.  Since the launch of the Scheme, payments in respect of 4,307 apprentice registrations have been made to date with a current spend of &euro;8.614m. Estimates suggest that between 4500- 5000 Unique employers will be supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, SOLAS offers a bursary of &euro;2,666.44 to eligible employers, to encourage them to employ female apprentices in one of the craft apprenticeships.  Under the Action Plan this bursary will be expanded to all programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender.</p></reply>

The overall vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population. </p><p>The National Access Plan (NAP) identifies the target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education, Irish Travellers, students with disabilities, first time mature student entrants, part-time/flexible learners and further education award holders. Lone parents are also included in this grouping.</p><p>Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) is currently underway. A consultation paper was published in April, the details of which can be accessed at the following link:  <i>www.gov.ie/en/consultation/3ee28-consultation-on-the-next-national-plan-for-equity-of-access-to-higher-education-2022-2026/ </i></p><p>The fifth annual Access Forum was held on the 23<sup>rd</sup>of April which afforded an opportunity for key stakeholders representing: students; schools and higher education institutions; access, disability and mature student officers; representatives of the National Access Plan targets groups; and representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, to input and shape the next plan. A student consolation event was also held in early May to garner the views of students about what&rsquo;s working well and what the focus of the next NAP should be.</p><p>The public consultation process closed on 18th June 2021. The Higher Education Authority is currently examining the various submissions received.  One-to-one meetings with key stakeholders is currently underway. My intention is to publish the new NAP before the end of 2021.</p><p>In terms of expenditure on supports for students, my Department is spending circa &euro;450m annually. Some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student populace.</p><p>The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme which is administered by SUSI and supports circa 75,000 each year. The Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities each support circa 14,000 students annually. There are currently three strands of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) programme which are targeting supports at the NAP target groups via supports for initial teacher education, a 1916 bursary scheme and a community engagement programme. Additional support is made available through the core funding of higher education institutions where funding is provided to put in place the necessary access infrastructure to support our target groups.</p><p>Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports, the Deputy will be aware of the range of additional supports that were put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's COVID response last year. These included: additional supports for access measures in higher education; a mitigating educational disadvantage fund for further education and training; a student laptop scheme; a once off grant of &euro;250 for students; additional funding for student mental health and wellbeing; and Dormant Accounts Funding for Traveller access to and progress within higher education.</p><p>All proposals made in relation to the next National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education will be considered in the context of the development of the new plan, the Estimates process and the ongoing consultations with key stakeholders.</p></reply>

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also supported the development of research and technological innovation in Ireland through the SFI Research Centres and Spokes Programme and developing stronger links between industry and higher education institutions. </p><p>The European Social Fund (ESF) Operational Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 supported a range of programmes in the further and higher education sector, including Youthreach and Community Training Centres; Adult Literacy; the Back to Education Initiative; ETB Training for the Unemployed and Third Level Access. </p><p>Details of EU funding in Ireland are available at <i>www.eufunds.ie.</i></p><p>While people with disabilities are participating in the range of programmes supported by the ESF, the purpose of the Third Level Access Fund for Students with Disabilities is to assist higher education institutions in ensuring students with disabilities have the necessary assistance and equipment to enable them access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study.</p><p>A Partnership Process Steering Group has been established to assist and advise the programming authorities throughout the development process for the Partnership Agreement and the various Cohesion Policy Programmes (including the ERDF and ESF+) for the 2021 &ndash; 2027 funding round.  A Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ESF+ and ERDF programmes and a public consultation process was undertaken last year.</p><p>The European Commission highlighted the need to support and develop services to improve the employment situation of people with disabilities in its investment guidance on cohesion policy funding for Ireland in 2021-27. The needs analysis also advocates that ESF+ funding should be directed towards labour market programmes and training programmes aimed at improving employment access for this group.  Work is ongoing on the draft Partnership Agreement and draft Operational Programmes with a view to Government Approval and formal submission to the Commission later in 2021.  </p></reply>

This year the postgraduate fee grant will increase from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants will increase from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240.

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the reference period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p><p>The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p><p>The PUP payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process.</p><p>Furthermore, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same.</p><p>Such a change in circumstances includes no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p><p>The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. The application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p><p>Under Article 22(5)(b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, income from an applicant&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period up to a maximum of &euro;4,500 can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed. </p><p>This holiday earnings disregard under the Student Grant Scheme can only be applied to income from employment earned by the student in the manner described. The holiday earnings disregard pertains specifically to income from employment only; there is no provision to offset this disregard against any other sources of income, such as a social welfare payment.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that restrictions were eased during the summer months and the Christmas period which enabled many students to return to work. Those students, who engaged in work during non-term times when restrictions were eased in 2020, can avail of the holiday earnings provision and have that income excluded from their reckonable income up to the value of &euro;4,500 for the 2021/22 grant scheme. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students can apply for supports under the Student Assistance Fund. The fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for the Postgraduate Special Rate of Maintenance grant, the income threshold for this grant is &euro;24,500, also postgraduate students are eligible to have their post graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports for the 2021/22 academic year including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants to increase from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240.

Accordingly it is not now proposed to claim EU cofinancing for Springboard; ICT Skills Conversion; Ability Programme; Gender Equality; Integration of Migrants; and the Youth Employment Support Scheme.  </p><p>Receipts of &euro;300m have been received on foot of payment applications and distributed to activities as set out in the attached table.A further &euro;21.5m has been received but has yet to be distributed and further receipts are expected on foot of payment applications submitted to the Commission on 30<sup>th</sup>June.  Updated cofinancing data will be available when these receipts are received and distributed.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s REACT EU 2021 allocation of &euro;88m will be programmed through the ESF.  While the relevant Operational Programme amendment has to be finalised, the intention is to support the education and training measures in the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus package and to assist the transition to online and blended learning in the Higher and Further Education Sector.</p><p>For the 2021-27 funding round, the European Social Fund is merged with the YEI, the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) and the directly managed Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) Programme, to become the ESF+.A Partnership Process Steering Group has been established to assist and advise the programming authorities throughout the development process for the Partnership Agreement and the various Operational Programmes (including the ESF+).  A Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ESF+ and ERDF programmes and a public consultation process was undertaken last year.Work is ongoing on the draft Partnership Agreement and draft Operational Programmes with a view to Government Approval and formal submission to the Commission later in 2021.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s total ESF+ allocation for 2021-27 is &euro;508m.  Ireland will have three NUTS 2 regions in this round, with two different standard rates of co-financing. As &lsquo;more developed&rsquo; regions, the Southern and the Eastern &amp;amp; Midlands regions will receive 40% in EU co-financing, while as a &lsquo;transition&rsquo; region the North-Western region will receive 60% in EU co-financing. A higher rate of co-financing of up to 95% is available for &lsquo;social innovation&rsquo; actions and a co-financing rate of 90% applies to the former FEAD programme.  The final allocation between programmes and regions will be determined in the context of discussions with the European Commission on the Partnership Agreement covering all Common Provisions Regulation funds having regard to the regulatory requirements on thematic concentrations. <table>    <tr>       <th>Activity</th>       <th>Co-financing Receipts Distributed to date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PRIORITY 1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ETB Training for the Unemployed</td>       <td>&euro;61,810,911</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Intra EU mobility</td>       <td>&euro;516,760</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority 1 Total</td>       <td>&euro;62,327,670</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PRIORITY 2</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SICAP</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Youthreach</td>       <td>&euro;19,803,935</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GYDP</td>       <td>&euro;22,292,949</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>YPP</td>       <td>&euro;3,068,364</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tus Nua project</td>       <td>&euro;313,618</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority Total</td>       <td>&euro;45,478,867</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PRIORITY 3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third Level Access</td>       <td>&euro;11,283,768</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BTEI</td>       <td>&euro;36,477,349</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Adult Literacy</td>       <td>&euro;45,242,906</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority Totals</td>       <td>&euro;93,004,023</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority 4</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BTWEA</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>JobsPlus </td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Youthreach</td>       <td>&euro;98,729,451</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community Training Centres</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Defence Forces Employment Scheme</td>       <td>&euro;427,870</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority Totals</td>       <td>&euro;99,157,321</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Priority 5</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Technical Assistance</td>       <td>&euro;710,401</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>&euro;300,678,282</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs. </p>  <p>  A range of supports and measures are in place for learners with disabilities; some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student populace. The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  Circa 75,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each institution who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  Circa &euro;40m is allocated annually to higher education institutions (HEIs), through their core funding, in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups to access and successfully complete higher education.</p>  <p>  Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports, the Deputy will be aware of the range of additional supports that were put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's COVID response last year. These included: additional supports for access measures in higher education; a mitigating educational disadvantage fund for further education and training; a student laptop scheme; a once off grant of &euro;250 for students; additional funding for student mental health and wellbeing; and Dormant Accounts Funding for Traveller access to and progress within higher education.</p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2016-2021 (NAP) has set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.3% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declaring a disability.</p>  <p>  While there is significant provision for students with intellectual disabilities in the further education and training sector where there were 2,821 learners with intellectual disabilities in 2019 and some provision in the higher education sector involving a comparatively small number of learners. I have asked my officials to engage with the HEA and SOLAS to see where we can play a stronger role, in meeting the educational needs of this group as part of a coherent whole of Government responses. We are at an early stage of work in this area, but it is an area I am strongly committed to pursuing.</p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), and the 16 ETBs across the country have progressed a series of actions to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion through the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines to promote inclusion throughout FET, including for learners with a disability. This includes the development of a conceptual framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for the FET Sector, which aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities. SOLAS are also working on finalising a report on &lsquo;Guidelines on Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities in Adult Literacy Service&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with a disability. Supports in the FET sector for learners with a disability include access to the Fund for Students with a Disability (FSD), a wide range of reasonable accommodations depending on the learner&rsquo;s needs, the Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), as well as provision of specific programmes for learners with a disability who may require more intensive supports through Specialist Training Provision (STP).</p>  <p>  Ensuring that the apprenticeship population reflects the general population is a stated aim of the Government in both the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.  Targets for participation by under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups will be set in conjunction with the Equity of Access Subcommittee (of the National Apprenticeship Alliance)  and will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions are working and that we are delivering greater diversity across the apprentice population.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential.</p></reply>

Prospective applicants on higher incomes may not have applied for support as their income was above the relevant threshold.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of increasing the SUSI income thresholds by 10% is as follows. </p>  <p>  - Increase in cost to the exchequer for 10% would be in the region of &euro;20-&euro;30M</p>  <p>  The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  The annual spend for the 2020/21 academic year as of June 2021 was in the region of &euro;160M. </p>  <p>  Based on the number of students in receipt of the maintenance grant for 2020/21, the estimated cost of increasing all rates of the maintenance grant by 10% is in the region of &euro;16.5M.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, amongst other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. The review of the Student Grant Scheme is underway with over 250 submissions received via the public consultation process and over 9,000 survey responses were received through an online survey process. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.  At this point I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review to indicate when any proposed changes will come into effect. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-13a.1460.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021071300094#WRBB05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 543, 544, 545 and 546 together.</p><p>The Atypical Working Scheme, which commenced in February 2016, was established as a cross Departmental response to address the matter of non-EEA workers on certain categories of vessels in the Irish fishing fleet, who are not currently eligible for permission under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) employment permit system. The Scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet.  </p><p>The table below sets out the nationalities of the 133 applications for renewal of permission, as requested by the Deputy. <table>    <tr>       <th>Philippines</th>       <th>60</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Egypt</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other nationalities*</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>133</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Due to the low numbers involved, it is not possible to provide a more detailed breakdown, which may lead to the identification of individuals.  </p><p>At the end of December 2019, there were a total of 230 individuals holding valid letters of permission under the Scheme. Of this group, a total of 61 individuals have not renewed their permission under the Scheme since that time. However, anyone who received a permission under the Scheme in late December 2019, would have been eligible for the automatic extensions of immigration permissions granted as a result of the pandemic, on the same terms and conditions as their original permission. The most recent extension granted is to 20 September 2021. </p><p>My Department does not seek information on the reasons why an individual might elect not to renew their permission to reside or work in the State when that permission expires.  It would not be appropriate to provide any further information on this small number of individuals, which may lead to their identification.</p><p>Holders of Atypical Working Scheme permits do not meet the eligibility criteria for conversion to a Stamp 4 permission under the Long Term Residency administrative scheme operated by my Department. Eligibility for Long Term Residency is restricted to holders of an employment permit from DETE. </p><p>It is open to the fishing industry to apply for inclusion in the DETE employment permit scheme and I understand that my colleague, Minister English, advised them of this at a recent meeting with industry representatives. Inclusion in the employment permit system would secure Stamp 4 status. </p><p>Holders of Atypical Working Permits can make an application for a certificate of naturalisation once they meet the residency criteria of five years legal residence in the State. The Stamp 1 granted to Sea Fishers under the terms of the Atypical Scheme is considered reckonable residence for the purpose of making an application for naturalisation. </p><p>Investigation and prosecution of breaches of employment law is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission. To date, my Department has not been made aware of any confirmed breaches requiring the barring of a vessel owner from employing future individuals under the Scheme. The 2015 Task Force Report, which sets out the terms and requirements of the Atypical Working Scheme for non-EEA crew in the Irish fishing fleet, includes the requirement that &ldquo;Where the contract is breached by the licence holder (employer), no further Atypical Worker Permission will be made available for the purposes of employment to the licence holder (employer)&rdquo;. </p></reply>

The new Strategy will have a significant focus on service delivery, as well as cohesive governance and oversight arrangements and will, as the Deputy mentions, place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. It is on track to be developed and brought to Government before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department has partnered with key stakeholders in Safe Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council to provide expert support and guidance in progressing this new strategy. Their work is supported by consultants KW Research, who are working on a number of different elements including a review of the second national strategy, identifying the major issues to be addressed, and coordinating public input into the new strategy.

The analysis of the feedback at these events and the results of an online survey are currently being examined. Interviews with senior decision makers in each relevant Department and agency have also been undertaken. </p>  <p>  The next stage will be to identify a set of draft high-level goals and outcomes for agreement.

These actions include the implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey. </p>  <p>  As part of implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, my Department has reviewed our grant schemes for organisations working with victims of crime. We have also undertaken an exercise to identify geographical areas where a full range of services are still not available. My Department will be working with the NGO sector to identify suitable providers to fill the gaps identified. </p>  <p>  We have also been working with key NGOs represented on the DSGVB Strategy Monitoring Committee to map the journey that a typical victim or victims faces. This has already provided some really valuable information which points primarily to training needs and supervision issues for frontline services and we will now look at agreeing actions to be taken to meet those needs.</p>  <p>  Another important part of the work we are doing to improve how we support victims of DSGBV is the audit of how responsibility for how DSGBV services is segmented across Departments and agencies. The report of the audit has now been finalised and was brought to Government today. Going forward, the audit will be an important piece of work which will help ensure we have the right structures in place to respond to all of the issues arising as a result of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla is currently undertaking a review of accommodation needs and the outcome of this, together with the recommendations of the audit and the ongoing work of implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey, will feed into the development of the next National Strategy on DSGBV. </p>  <p>  The development of the new strategy is happening in close consultation with the sector and my Department has partnered with key stakeholders in Safe Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council to provide expert support and guidance in progressing this new strategy. </p>  <p>  It is my intention that a draft of this new strategy will be ready for a further round of public consultation in September.</p></reply>

For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.</p><p>The 2017 Act amended the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act 1990, inter alia by setting out certain circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.  The list is non-exhaustive, and the Act specifically states that the section concerned does not limit the circumstances in which it may be established that a person did not consent to a sexual act. Coercion other than the threat of physical force is a factor that may be considered when examining whether or not consent was given. </p><p>In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.<ol type="1"><li>Sexual intercourse must have taken place;</li><li>the person must not have consented; and</li><li>the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.</li></ol>During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused honestly believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented would not be found guilty of rape. </p><p>It was on foot of those debates that the Attorney General and one of my predecessors as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration.

This includes the full and timely implementation of the detailed roadmap for the introduction of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley Review.  Entitled Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases this plan will, when implemented, protect and support vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences.  </p>  <p>  Among the many issues being dealt with by Supporting a Victim's Journey are legal representation for victims, and the need for victims to be treated with dignity and respect at every stage throughout the process, including during any questioning around the victim's sexual experience. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Procedure Act, which was signed into law by the President on the 24th of May 2021 introduces key changes to the way questioning on prior sexual history will unfold at a trial. Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Act will require the intention to question a victim on their prior sexual history to be raised at a preliminary trial hearing, before the commencement of the trial. This will be of great help to victims as it removes uncertainty, brings the issue forward to the start of the process, allows them to know in advance and be informed as to whether this type of questioning will be permitted in the trial.</p>  <p>  Supporting a Victim's Journey will also ensure the victim's right to have the same legal representation at the preliminary trial hearing and during the trial itself if an application to question them about prior sexual history is made at the preliminary trial hearing and is granted.  </p>  <p>  The victim will be entitled to their own, dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process (not just during the court case). The victim will also be entitled to legal aid for this purpose. The availability of a legal expert in their corner, should they wish, will be of great assistance and they will have someone whose only role in the case is to advise them. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 5.5 of Supporting a Victim's Journey states that once notification has been given at a preliminary trial hearing of intention to apply for leave to question a victim at trial under the terms of section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981, the Legal Aid Board should be immediately informed. The Legal Aid Board, in turn, should endeavour to ensure that the victim is represented by counsel of a level of seniority similar to that of counsel representing the prosecution and defence.</p>  <p>  My Department sought leave from of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to make changes to the fee structure of the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Barrister&rsquo;s panel. Having written to DPER in that regard in early November 2020, sanction was given in early March for either a single Junior or Senior Counsel to support victims in connection with applications under section 3/4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 in which they are entitled to separate legal representation and where they have been granted legal aid. </p>  <p>  Implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey in full will require a number of legislative changes, the first being the Criminal Procedure Act, discussed above. In order to implement the rest of the required changes needed, a scoping exercise is currently being undertaken by my Department for a new Sexual Offences Bill. The Bill will encompass provisions to implement the O&rsquo;Malley Report recommendations as well as for additional harassment orders to the 2017 Sexual Offences Act and to implement the recommendations of the 2019 Law Reform Commission Report on Knowledge or Belief Concerning Consent in Rape Law.  </p>  <p>  The proposed amendments to the legislation dealing with sexual offences will need detailed consideration from a policy perspective throughout the development of a general scheme of a Bill and the subsequent drafting process. This will include engagement with stakeholders and careful assessment of implications and costings. </p>  <p>  I envisage that General Scheme of this Bill will be brought to Cabinet by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

Separately, the Bar of Ireland&rsquo;s existing Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme incorporates training for barristers dealing with vulnerable witnesses.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Supporting a Victim's Journey has always been classed as a "living" document - one that will evolve as needed. This means that additional recommendations for improving how the criminal system protects and supports vulnerable victims and witnesses can be examined and potentially added. </p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy is one of a number of issues that officials in my Department are examining in this regard.</p></reply>

During this early period, prison officers did not have the option of using wand scanners or &lsquo;pat down&rsquo; searches on visitors.  As Deputies will be aware, the number of visitors during this period was limited because of Covid restrictions and other options such as video and phone visits were offered to both family members and legal representatives.  I am informed that visitors who activated the walkthrough metal detector were given the option of rescheduling their visit.  My understanding is that this was a strictly temporary measure, as the prison service was adapting its procedures to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Since June 2020, IPS procedures require Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be worn by all, including staff and visitors, and this facilitated the return of handheld wand and &lsquo;pat down&rsquo; searches, albeit in line with appropriate infection control procedures. </p>  <p>  As you may be aware, I sought a report on this issue which my Department received today from the Irish Prison Service.  The Service is also currently reviewing all Standard Operating Procedures to ensure they take full account of people&rsquo;s dignity and include guidance on appropriate use of language.  My officials will consider this report in detail following which I will assess what further action may be necessary or appropriate.</p>  <p>  I do think that it is important to state that, broadly speaking, security screening is a standard and important security measure in operation within all prisons settings.  People go to significant lengths to seek to smuggle contraband into our prisons and it is important to have appropriately robust security measures in place to prevent this. Security screening is an essential element in preventing crime which can involve pressure on vulnerable family members to smuggle in contraband.  Implementing these measures appropriately with respect for human dignity is vital to maintaining a safe and secure environment for prisoners and staff.  </p>  <p>  That said, the Director General has assured me that she deeply regrets if these temporary restrictions caused distress or upset to any visitors.   I will of course consider any request for a meeting with the individual concerned.</p></reply>

Vaccinations are being administered by the National Ambulance Service, supported by Prison Service health care teams to all prisoners, and unvaccinated staff under 40 years of age. In line with the vaccination schedule, physical visits to prisons will recommence on a phased prison by prison basis with visits resuming 7 days after prisoners have been fully vaccinated. To date, nine prisons have received their first round of vaccinations with the remaining three prisons scheduled in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that in the past week a second round of vaccinations took place in Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons and the Irish Prison Service will recommence physical visits in Wheatfield Prison on 14 July and in Portlaoise Prison on 16 July.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, under the current vaccination schedule, it is expected that visits will have recommenced in eight prisons by the end of July with visits returning to the remaining four locations in August and September (Midlands, Limerick, Cloverhill and Cork Prisons).  </p>  <p>  However, it is also important to note that this will be subject to consideration of infection and hospitalisation levels in the community, given the increased concern surrounding the Delta variant. </p>  <p>  The operation and frequency of visits will be kept under ongoing review, guided by HSE, Public Health advice and with a desire to support as much contact as possible between prisoners and their families.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can advise the Deputy that the video visit system which was introduced in 2020 has proven very successful and when physical visits recommence, the Irish Prison Service will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners.  </p>  <p>  Detailed information for families in relation to the operation of visits and booking system is available on the Irish Prison Service website www.irishprisons.ie.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The information provided as part of this process is recorded on the person&rsquo;s individual medical record on the Prison Healthcare Management System. This information allows for the development of an individual healthcare plan for the prisoner while in custody. Where necessary, the person is referred to a forensic clinician or Prison Service Psychologist or both.

However, since 2016, the number of persons in custody had been steadily increasing until March 2020 when this trend was ended with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Since March 2020, as part of its response to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic in custodial setting, the Prison Service has been implementing measures to reduce the prison population. This has been done in order to ensure good infection control and to ensure that cells are available for the accommodation of any prisoner who may be required to isolate in accordance with guidance from the public health authorities.</p><p>In 2019, in response to increasing prisoner numbers, the Director General introduced a Prison Population Management Plan aimed at identifying the short, medium and long term actions required to address the rising prisoner numbers. As a result, approximately 135 additional beds were introduced.

The then Minister of State received many representations from a range of stakeholders at the time and these were extensively discussed and publicised.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Act modernises the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and will help the better promotion of local gaming and lottery activity held primarily for charitable and philanthropic purposes, and which are an important source of funding to sporting clubs and community organisations across the country.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Act amends the 1956 Act to provide for lotteries promoted under licence for charitable and philanthropic causes only (e.g. sports clubs, community groups, etc.). A licence, once issued by the District Court, remains valid for 12 months and the maximum prize remains at not more than &euro;360,000, if a lottery is held as a once off event in a year. This could apply to situations where sports clubs might raffle high value items, for example, properties. The maximum prize of &euro;360,000 was introduced to give legal certainty to the offering of one single prize. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Act is an interim reform measure pending the comprehensive reform of gambling. The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme of the Bill in Q3 2021, and will seek Government approval for the drafting of the Bill on that basis. While it is possible to amend the threshold by statutory instrument, given the imminence of that legislation any changes would best be reflected there, as part of the wider reform process.</p>  <p>  Once the Scheme of the Bill is published, I expect that there will be engagement with interested stakeholders as work on the establishment of a gambling regulator progresses. Information on how that engagement will be structured will be provided in due course. In the meantime, my Department continues to welcome any submissions that stakeholders wish to make.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in its functions. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that probate matters are dealt with in its Dublin Office and in 14 District Registries nationwide. Unfortunately, the Courts Service does not maintain statistics in the manner requested by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  District Registries normally are small offices and I understand from the Courts Service that staff turnover can lead to temporary spikes in waiting times while vacancies are filled. However, the staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing any backlogs while the Courts Service is committed to continuing to resource this work to minimise waiting times as far as possible.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Courts Service has confirmed that interviews for personal applications resumed in May and additional staff resources have been allocated in some locations to facilitate these interviews. </p>  <p>  The Dublin Probate Office accounts for over fifty per cent of all probate applications lodged in this jurisdiction, and the waiting time for solicitor applications is at its lowest point for many years. For applications that are correct, the waiting period is six weeks. In Cork, the Deputy may be interested to know that waiting times are 10-12 weeks for solicitors, and 14 weeks for personal applications. This compares favourably with pre-pandemic waiting times, which were 10 weeks and 12 weeks respectively in November 2019.</p></reply>

This Convention is implemented in Ireland through the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995.</p>  <p>  Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA (which relates to the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty) will replace the Convention for transfers between EU Member States. The Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Bill 2021, which will transpose the Framework Decision, is being progressed and was approved for publication by Government today.</p>  <p>  Due to Brexit, the Framework Decision will not apply to the UK, so transfers to and from the UK will be conducted under the Convention regime. However, significant legal issues have arisen in respect of transfers under the Convention regime. </p>  <p>  These issues are considered and analysed in detail in the decisions of the Supreme Court in Sweeney v. Governor Loughlan House Open Centre &amp;amp; Ors [2014] IESC 42, O&rsquo;Farrell &amp;amp; Ors v. The Governor of Portlaoise Prison [2016] IESC 37, and McK v. Minister for Justice [2018] IECA 110.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to provide a legal interpretation of these judgments, the effect of the decisions in these cases is to call into question the robustness of inward transfers, most notably where a potential incompatibility arises between the sentence imposed in the sentencing state and how that sentence would be enforced under Irish law. Particular difficulties arise in respect of transfers from the United Kingdom due to the operation of automatic release on license under UK law in certain circumstances, but similar difficulties may arise in respect of other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  These issues are being addressed in respect of transfers from Framework Decision states in the 2021 Bill to be published shortly. However, amendments to the 1995 Act will be required in respect transfers from Convention states (including the UK). The Minister intends to seek Government approval to include these changes in the 2021 Bill by way of committee stage amendment.</p></reply>

The entire estate then becomes a net removal increasing to 3MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. per year by 2050. These projections are based on an afforestation rate of 8,000 ha per year, business as usual forest management practice and levels of harvest as specified in the COFORD All-Ireland Roundwood Forecast. </p><p>The changes in the forest sink overtime are due to a number of factors, which include high rates of afforestation achieved in earlier decades, a projected increase in sustainable harvest and future deforestation that may occur. When examining the existing forest estate, it is important that afforestation continues over the next decade and beyond to ensure that the forest estate remains a net sink out to 2050. Carbon modelling estimates suggest that an afforestation level of approximately 12,000 hectares per year would reduce the impact of the entire estate being a source towards 2035. However, this is also dependent on future levels of deforestation, harvest and forest management practices. </p><p>Although the historical age class legacy has a temporary negative influence on the National forest sink, the NFAP demonstrates that forest sinks are maintained into the second half of this century as required under the Paris agreement.</p></reply>

The definition of a forest is defined as areas which are 0.1 hectares or more in size and which have the capacity to reach at least 5 meters in height and with a minimum canopy cover of at least 20%. Ireland uses this definition as defined in the LULUCF regulation to account for all forest plots that meet this criteria.</p>  <p>  Although Individual trees and groups of trees are important for biodiversity and do sequester carbon, they are not recorded against the forest land use categories as defined in the LULUCF regulation. Individual trees are similar to hedgerows in that they can only be accounted in other cropland and grassland categories if there are detailed national inventory data to support their inclusion. Ireland does not account for hedgerows or individual trees specifically but research is ongoing by the EPA and Teagasc to examine methods of potentially including such areas in future inventories.  </p>  <p>  However, more detailed work is required to determine and map the extent of such features in the landscape which is a significant task. It is also worth noting that, if such features are recorded, Ireland could only account for the additional trees and hedgerows planted. If there were less hedgerows and individual trees recorded than in previous years,  Ireland would have to account this as an emission of carbon dioxide.</p>  <p>  The Department does not intend to change the definition of a forest and will continue to account for all forests that meet the current definition. Plots that fall below this area threshold may be included at a future date under non forest land use categories and will be informed by existing and further research.</p></reply>

In addition, the industry employs c.2,000 persons predominately along the western seaboard.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Plan recognises the potential of aquaculture across the full range of species, to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s growing seafood exports and to provide quality jobs in our coastal communities.  The 2015 Plan seeks to address the issues constraining the growth of the sector, while also implementing a range of actions to ensure that the growth of aquaculture production is sustainable.  </p>  <p>  The Department is at present engaged, together with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute, in drafting a new National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture for the period 2021-30.  This work is consistent with the European Union&rsquo;s new Strategic Guidelines for a Sustainable and Competitive EU Aquaculture for the Period 2021-30, published in May 2021.   </p>  <p>  The European Green Deal is the EU&rsquo;s new growth strategy and aims at stimulating the economy and creating jobs while accelerating the green transition in a cost-efficient way. The EU Strategic Guidelines aim to offer a common vision for EU Member States and all relevant stakeholders for the further development of aquaculture in the EU in a way that contributes to the Green Deal growth strategy. In particular, the EU guidelines aim to help in building an EU aquaculture sector that is competitive and resilient, ensures the supply of nutritious and healthy food, reduces the EU&rsquo;s dependency on seafood imports, creates economic opportunities and jobs and becomes a global reference for sustainability.  </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s new National Strategic Plan shares the EU vision and will be following a common structure and approach with other Member States, who are likewise preparing similar plans.  The new National Strategic Plan is of course subject to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive and a public consultation on the SEA Environmental Report will be undertaken in the Autumn.</p></reply>

The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various Statutory Consultees. The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation. All submissions received during the public and statutory consultation phase are considered during the licensing process. </p><p>EU legislation which has subsequently been transposed into Irish law has contributed significantly to the protection of the environment, including the aquaculture sector. The EU Habitats and Birds Directives have resulted in the designation of certain bays by the National Parks and Wildlife Services as 'Special Areas of Conservation' and/or 'Special Protection Areas' for birds.  These are known as 'Natura 2000' sites and most aquaculture takes place within them, or adjacent to them.  </p><p>A key component of the Aquaculture Licensing process is a series of measures designed to address the impact of aquaculture on the environment.  This series of measures is known as &quot;Appropriate Assessment&quot;.  All applications for aquaculture licences in Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas (Natura 2000 sites) are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  </p><p>In addition, applications for marine finfish licences must be accompanied by a detailed Environment Impact Assessment Report as set out in both EU &amp;amp; national legislation. </p><p>As will be seen therefore, the fullest consideration of all potential environmental impacts takes place in advance of any decision to grant an aquaculture licence and, where appropriate, an application may be refused or modified to take account of such environmental impacts.</p></reply>

We have a business systems analyst carrying out an end-to-end review of the process and this will hopefully lead to recommendations for improvements. Furthermore, the Department will, in the near future, procure expertise to carry out a review of the regulatory and planning framework for forestry licensing which could yield further efficiencies. Other recommendations under consideration by the Project Board also have potential to assist with licensing outcomes.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to issue both private and Coillte licences so that the licensing requirements to supply timber for sawmills can be assured and that they can forward plan for their business. </p>  <p>  Afforestation, road and private licences continue to be processed, but it is the case that more private felling licences have issued recently when compared to roads afforestation.  The reason for this is the introduction of a system improvement for the preparation of Appropriate Assessment Screening Determinations, Appropriate Assessment Reports and Appropriate Assessment Determinations. Improvements have been made to the system to optimise the time of the ecologists to concentrate on the ecology aspects of each application.  Currently, these improvements are only applied to private tree felling licence  applications, which as mentioned has already yielded results with increased licences issued.  The ecologists have been working mostly on these felling applications in advance of the system being developed further for other licensed activities.  </p>  <p>  In the coming days, the system will be rolled out for processing road files and the development of the system improvement to assist with processing afforestation files will commence over the next few weeks.  Once this is in place, we should begin to see an increase in afforestation and roads licences, although the recent introduction of a second stage 30-day public consultation process for applications subject to Appropriate Assessment will have an impact on when we see this increase.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, along with my colleague Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for forestry, I remain committed to issuing 4,500 forestry licences this year, which covers felling, afforestation and roads and which is an increase of 75% on 2020.

Ireland's forests amount to over 770,000 hectares, or about 11% of the land area of Ireland. These forests comprise a wide variety of species from native broadleaves to commercial conifers. All trees contribute to providing important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, recreational access in public forests but also provide important renewable materials such as timber and wood products.  </p>  <p>  According to the Department's National Forest Inventory, approximately 71.2% of the forests in Ireland consist of conifer forests with broadleaves amounting to 28.2%. Conifer species provide the main material for the building of homes, providing renewable energy and support over 12,000 jobs. The national forest inventory (NFI) also finds that Sitka spruce is the main conifer species at 51%, with a range of other species also recorded. Sitka spruce has proved to be an excellent timber species and provides the majority of material for the sawmilling and panel board mills in Ireland and contributes to the sustainable economic functions of forests. However, diversification of species is important and the Department continues to provides a range of financial incentives to increase the amount of other conifers and broadleaves planted.  </p>  <p>  The Forestry Act 2014 and the regulation of afforestation and felling activities also supports the sustainable management of forests by creating new forests and replanting when forests are harvested. The balance between how much forests grow each year and how much is harvested is an important indicator of sustainable forest management.   Ireland's NFI demonstrates that the national forest estate is not harvesting more timber than the forest can produce. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also committed to the sustainable management of forests and is a signatory to the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, known as Forest Europe.</p></reply>

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time.</p>  <p>  The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.  Conservation measures in recent years have reduced mortality significantly and stabilised the decline. The biomass (a measures of the quantity of the stock) of the species has started to increase slowly, however, the biomass remains extremely low and is below the biomass limit reference point established by ICES. </p>  <p>  The latest scientific advice issued by ICES on 2nd October 2020 is that there should be no targeted fisheries for dogfish in 2021 and 2022. On the basis of this advice, and as the EU manages fish stocks having regard for this advice, there appears currently no liklihood of re-introducing a targeted fishery in the period covered by this advice.</p>  <p>  While there is a very limited quota available for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce by-catches, any such schemes are subject to European Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of dogfish in other fisheries, i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited. A scheme for dogfish avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute but, following consultation with the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), it was decided not to proceed further with a scheme taking into account how such a scheme would operate.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposal for cooperation between the Marine Institute and industry in conducting surveys on the abundance of spurdog around the coast, I will refer this request to the Marine Institute for consideration within its Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership, involving industry representatives, Marine Institute and BIM, where research projects assessments and priorities are actively discussed.</p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels, including illegal catches of spurdog, within Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.</p></reply>

A phased programme for the infrastructural development and maintenance of the six FHCs has been progressed over the last number of years. Between 2010 and 2020, over &euro;139m has been invested in these developments.</p>  <p>  In recognition of increasing levels of fishing, commercial cargo (incl wind turbine parts) and cruise liner activity in Killybegs, a project to provide an additional 120m of quay space at Smooth Point was initiated. Phase 1 of the project, which entailed the dredging and removal of the contaminated material, commenced in 2017 and was completed in 2018.  </p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the project involves the dredging of the remaining uncontaminated material and construction of the 120 metres of berthing space. Work is progressing on the project which has been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. It is still expected to be substantially completed by the Spring of 2022 with a total project cost (phase 1 and phase 2) of approximately &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  Should any proposals be brought forward either centrally or from private enterprises to develop the infrastructure in any of the FHCs to support the marine renewable industry, they will be considered as appropriate. As is the case with all developments in the six FHCs generally, any future decision regarding formally initiating capital projects will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding, competing national priorities and compatability with existing activities.</p></reply>

No. 293 of 2021), the Department is required to provide additional opportunities for public consultation in relation to forestry licencing applications. </p><p>In response to requirements of this legislation, the Department has initiated a revised public consultation to ensure that there is full public participation in decision-making around projects that may have affect European sites.  There will now be a second 30-day consultation period which will take place after receipt of a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) or after an Appropriate Assessment Report is produced by the Department, and relevant documentation will be published in the Forestry Licence Viewer. If an NIS is submitted with the initial application, only one public consultation period is required.</p><p>This is the new consultataion process, and it is one which makes for extensive public consultation on forestry licence applications. It applies to files which are screened-in for Appropriate Assessment. Any such files in the system that have not yet been decided, and future applications will be covered by this new consultation process with immediate effect.</p><p>It is critical to note that the Department has not suspended the issuing of forestry licence decisions. I assure the Deputy that my officials are assessing forestry licence applications on hand that are affected by this change and have already started to publish lists of forestry licences that are now open for this second public consultation phase. In addition, they have put in place new procedures to deal with this consultation.</p><p>Regarding applications that have been approved to date this year, the Department publishes the forestry dashboard weekly.  All forestry licences that are approved have conditions attached.  Therefore, I cannot give a breakdown of approved/approved with conditions. The number of applications approved and refused are given below, with the percentage of those screened in where an Appropriate Assessment Determination/Natura Impact Assessment is involved to date this year. <table>    <tr>       <th>Licence Type </th>       <th>Approved </th>       <th>Refused </th>       <th>% AAD/NIS</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afforestation </td>       <td>303 </td>       <td>15</td>       <td>62% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Forest Roads</td>       <td>358 </td>       <td>2</td>       <td>54% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private Tree Felling</td>       <td>568 </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>63% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Coillte Felling</td>       <td>537 </td>       <td>0</td>       <td>77%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>1,814 </td>       <td>18</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The map of live BCPs can be found on: nbi.ie/bcp-map/. </p><p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote working has proven its value in maintaining economic activity and many of the BCP sites are either currently offering facilities for remote workers or have plans to so in the near future. Remote working can help to retain talented people in rural communities, encourage mobile workers to move to the regions, provide increased trade for local businesses, and revitalise our rural towns.  </p><p>I launched the National Hub Network, connectedhubs.ie, on 31 May in the Swinford Digiwest Hub in Co. Mayo. Since the launch, 113 hubs have signed on and are now using the platform, with an additional 49 hubs in the process of being onboarded. Furthermore, the number of hubs identified through the Western Development Commission's hub discovery process has increased to 505. These are in the process of being verified before they are mapped on . This interactive map provides useful information in relation to each of the hubs and the services that are available at each site.</p><p>Since 2016 my Department has invested more than &euro;50 million in the development of remote working facilities through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Investment in new remote working facilities will continue in 2021 through further calls for both schemes. </p><p>I have also allocated &euro;5 million to fund a Connected Hubs Call this year. This initiative will provide funding to support small scale capital works in existing hubs and Broadband Connection Points. Applications are currently being evaluated by my officials and I expect to shortly be in a position to announce the results of the evaluation process.</p></reply>

These are entirely a matter for the Regulator.</p>  <p>  Concerns in relation to charities may be raised with the Regulator and I am assured by the Regulator that that all such concerns are addressed. Where breaches of charity legislation are identified, the charity is contacted with a view to addressing such breaches.</p>  <p>  I understand the Charities Regulator had been engaging with B&oacute;thar since early 2020 on foot of concerns which were raised about the charity.</p>  <p>  In October 2020, the Regulator determined that a statutory investigation into the charity was warranted, and appointed inspectors to commence this investigation. It is important to note that the commencement of such an investigation is not in itself a finding of any wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  A criminal investigation is now underway into activities at B&oacute;thar. At the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Charities Regulator&rsquo;s statutory investigation into the affairs of B&oacute;thar has been temporarily paused until such time as the criminal investigation is complete, at which time the Regulator&rsquo;s investigation will resume.</p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me, the Regulator or my Department to comment further on what is an ongoing criminal investigation.</p></reply>

This pertains to an ongoing matter relating to an employee.</p>  <p>  - The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office is currently acting on behalf of the Department being respondents in a Judicial Review case brought by applicants, Liam &Oacute; Dubhg&aacute;in trading as WJ Duggan. The Judicial review relates to the tender process involved in awarding a contract for the provision of a rapid passenger service (B&aacute;d gasta) to serve Toraigh Island in County Donegal. The applicant contests the manner and decisions taken by the Department in the assessment of tenders submitted. The case came for mention in the High Court on the 20 May 2019 and due to numerous requests for more time to prepare responses to affidavits submitted by both parties is still in progress. Because of the Judicial review award of the contract was halted pending the Court&rsquo;s decision. The next Court session is due for hearing later this month.</p></reply>
