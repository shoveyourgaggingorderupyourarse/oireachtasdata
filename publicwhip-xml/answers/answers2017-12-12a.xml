In this regard, in the absence of a mid-life upgrade, naval vessels have a planned life expectancy of 20 to 25 years.  The three ships most recently decommissioned by the Naval Service were L&Eacute; Emer, commissioned in 1978, L&Eacute; Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and L&Eacute; Aisling, commissioned in 1980.  Extensive engineering surveys and analyses were carried out by the Naval Service on these vessels given their age and service history prior to decommissioning.</p>  <p>  There is a programme of continuous planned and preventative maintenance to ensure that all Naval Service vessels are kept in a seaworthy condition.  The Naval Service will only send ships to sea when they are satisfied the ships are in a seaworthy and safe condition.  The older ships are monitored through increased inspections and maintenance of hull strength, fatigue life and machinery condition based on actual service history.  All factors such as condition of the hull structure, condition and maintenance/failure history of machinery, electrical and piping systems and operating profile and environments are evaluated to determine fatigue lives of critical structural components. </p>  <p>  The most significant investment of recent years by the Defence Organisation has been on the procurement of the new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  This programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels in the past 3 years.  The L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was commissioned in May 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce was commissioned in September 2015 and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned into service in October 2016. </p>  <p>  In June 2016, a contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International, a British company, bringing investment in the new ships programme to some &euro;250 million since 2010. The fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw is scheduled for delivery in mid-2018. </p>  <p>  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with an ongoing maintenance regime for all vessels within the fleet, and the continuous process of refurbishment, refit and repair, will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the State&rsquo;s principal seagoing agency, are maintained to the greatest extent. </p>  <p>  In addition to acquisitions, it is normal practice in a ship&rsquo;s life to carry out a mid-life refurbishment programme so as to extend the useful life of a ship to thirty or more years.  In this regard, the Defence Organisation has commenced planning for a mid-life refurbishment programme for L&Eacute; Roisin and L&Eacute; Niamh.  This structured mid-life refurbishment programme will future proof the vessels, allow for preventative maintenance and address obsolescence of equipment through capitalising on advancements in technology, thus ensuring reliability of the vessels for the next 15 years. </p>  <p>  As it stands three ships in the current flotilla are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla).  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity.  Planning has commenced on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV.  This, of course, is subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. </p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p></reply>

However, this is not new and the Defence Forces have always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other are a s of the public service.</p><p>Voluntary exit interviews of personnel of all ranks conducted by the Defence Forces indicate that the reasons for leaving range from economic factors to family circumstances, lifestyle and a desire for a change of career.</p><p>I remain committed to ensuring ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces and that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.</p><p>In order to balance personnel turnover there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers. </p><p>A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.</p><p>In terms of pay, following PDFORRA&rsquo;S acceptance of the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement earlier this year, adjustments have been applied to salary scales with the focus on the lower paid.  In particular general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013, have seen in some instances a combined increases in pay and military service allowance of more than &euro;5,000 per year.</p><p>The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 , also provides for further pay increasesranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. </p><p>The proposals in the agreement have been presented for consideration to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process.  They are subject to ballot by members of the Associations. </p><p>It should be noted that the remarks relating to levels of pay contained within the focus group report compiled by the University of Limerick, predate a number of measures which have been taken this year to increase the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel.</p><p>Whilst pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces was highlighted as an issue, there were a broad range of HR matters raised.  I am satisfied that these are being addressed.</p><p>I have announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study. In addition the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Where agreement is not reached it is open to both official and representative sides to refer the matter to an adjudicator or an arbitration Board to settle the matter. Permanent Defence Force personnel have achieved significant benefits down the years through this process.</p>  <p>  When appointed as Minister with responsibility for Defence, the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations brought to my attention, the fact that the current Conciliation &amp;amp; Arbitration (C&amp;A) scheme requires a fundamental review so that it can remain fit for purpose for the entire Defence Organisation.</p>  <p>  The C&amp;A scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force has been in existence since the early 1990&rsquo;s and I agree that it is timely to review the scheme.  In this regard, I announced my intention previously to review the C&amp;A Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>  The review will be guided by an independent chairperson, who I will appoint shortly.</p>  <p>  In advance of the commencement of the review, I arranged for draft terms of reference to be circulated to PDFORRA and RACO.  During the course of recent meetings I had with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, I requested that they revert to me with their comments on the draft terms of reference, which I would duly consider.</p>  <p>  I have received the views of both associations and am considering their suggestions.  As the draft terms of reference are not finalised, it would be premature to comment further at this time.   </p></reply>

EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, made a similar complaint to the Committee on behalf of PDFORRA about the lack of union rights for military Representative Associations in Ireland.</p><p>PDFORRA are claiming most of the same violations of the European Social Charter as AGSI.  This includes:</p><p>- denial of the right to join the ICTU,</p><p>- alleged restricted access to pay talks, and</p><p>- the prohibition on the right to strike.</p><p><font color="#020202">  Detailed final submissions were lodged to the European Committee on Social Rights on 26 February 2016 setting out Ireland&rsquo;s position in the matter.  We are now awaiting t</font><font color="#020202">he outcome of the case.</font></p><p>This issue raises complex questions for Ireland from a legal, operational and management perspective.  In this context, it is critically important that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times.  It must be emphasised that the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</p><p>It would be inappropriate for me to comment further until the process is complete.</p><p><font color="#020202">It would also be premature at this stage to make arrangements for legislative changes in advance of the publication of the findings of the European Committee on Social Rights. </font></p></reply>

In the Defence Forces these are decisions for highly qualified Medical Officers having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, a Working Group has examined issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam.  I have recently received its report and am considering same.</p>  <p>  I would like to again remind the House that there is ongoing litigation in relation to this matter.  The State Claims Agency manages claims on behalf of the Department of Defence and has confirmed that to date 58 claims have been made by members and former members of the Defence Forces who allege personal injury, as a result of their consumption of mefloquine (Lariam).  You will therefore appreciate that I am constrained in my discussions on the matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me and for the Defence Forces  . </p></reply>

Three ships have been delivered since 2014 and a fourth is due to be delivered by 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with larger and more capable fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance).  Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft.</p>  <p>  The Army&rsquo;s fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers mid-life upgrade will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower.  Additionally, updated 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicle are being acquired and it is planned to take delivery in 2018 of new armoured logistic vehicles.  These measures will also enhance force protection overseas.</p>  <p>  The examples given above, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  As part of budgetary negotiations for 2017, additional capital funding was allocated bringing the capital envelope up to &euro;416m over the 2018-2021 timeframe.  This will allow for significant investment in equipment and infrastructure over the coming years .   </p>  <p>  The primary function of training and education in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the military capabilities necessary to fulfil the roles laid down by Government and to respond too future threats to the State&rsquo;s security.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy has been adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021. </p>  <p>  In relation to Personnel, up to the end of October 2017 there have been 702 personnel inducted into the Defence Forces.  This is an increase from the 416 inducted in 2015 and 690 in 2016.  In 2016 more people were brought into the Defence Forces than left (690 in; 655 out).  This reversed a long term trend of more people leaving than entering the Defence Forces.  This has been possible because this Government significantly increased recruitment and it is expected that new entrants will again exceed exits in 2017.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.  This includes the provision of relevant assistance in response to emergency situations that may arise.   </p></reply>

It is important therefore to remain fully engaged in all CSDP processes.  Fully participating in these developments ensures that we have a voice and that we can influence the evolution of these initiatives.</p>  <p>  Now that we are participating in PESCO the focus for Ireland will be on identifying key PESCO projects which enhance the capability and capacity of the Defence Forces to successfully undertake modern complex UN mandated missions, including CSDP operations and on supporting interoperability in this regard.  Consideration is currently being given to the potential PESCO projects in which Ireland will participate.  The work on elaborating the details of these project proposals and potential participants is currently ongoing at EU level and Ireland is playing its full part in those deliberations.   </p>  <p>  Participation in PESCO will therefore allow the men and women of our Defence Forces, from all across the country including Co. Kildare, to continue to gain access to the latest and best equipment and training.  This will further enhance their capabilities for peacekeeping operations and above all help to ensure their security and safety when deployed on some of the most challenging UN mandated peace-keeping, peace enforcement and EU Training missions abroad.</p>  <p>  When the Defence Forces deploy overseas our men and women never do so alone.  We always work in close cooperation with other countries deployed on such operations. PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability with our future project partners, something that will be off huge benefit for our troops on future missions overseas.   </p></reply>

The Defence Forces is fully aware of the importance of attention to mental health.</p><p>Mental health services are part of the range of medical and non-medical services provided so as to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them.  Also, to treat any medical conditions arising which would inhibit their capacity to undertake such duties. </p><p>As a matter of policy, psychiatric and psychological services as well as the Personnel Support Service are available to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  These cover the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric or psychological disorders through to counselling and critical incident stress management. </p><p>The function of the Medical Corps of the Defence Forces is to provide medical services to serving members of the Defence Forces.  Medical mental health services provided by the Medical Corps comprise of:</p><p>a. Primary care services</p><p>b. Clinical psychiatry (both internal and external)</p><p>c. Clinical psychology services </p><p>Non-medical mental health services are provided by the Personnel Support Service (PSS) that acts as a secondary support to personnel.  The PSS makes confidential services including critical incident stress management and psychosocial support available to all Defence Forces personnel.  This is made available through its network of Barrack Personnel Support Service Officers and occupational social workers at formation, unit and barrack level.  The PSS supports contingents before, during and after overseas deployments and its trained personnel are deployed in response to any significant operational incidents at home or overseas.  The service is also available to the families of serving personnel. </p><p>As additional support, a confidential counselling service, provided by an independent service provider and funded by my Department, is available to all members of the Defence Forces.  Defence Forces personnel can access this service by calling a free phone number.  A counsellor is available to talk, provide information, discuss needs and advise on follow up counselling. Face-to-face counselling can then be provided to individuals if required.  The service complements existing Defence Forces personnel support services. </p><p>The medical services available are kept under review. </p></reply>

Operation Sophia was launched in June 2015 as part of the EU&rsquo;s broader action to provide a comprehensive response to the global migration and refugee crisis and to encourage a democratic, stable and prosperous Libya. It specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the Southern Central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers business model.  The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 2292.  This Resolution imposes an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related material into that country.</p>  <p>  In July 2017, I secured Government and D&aacute;il approval for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to serve as part of Operation Sophia.  L.&Eacute;. Niamh and crew departed Haulbowline on 06 October 2017 and joined the EU naval mission.  The specific tasks assigned to naval vessels by the Operation Sophia Force Commander, will depend on the operational requirements in the Mediterranean area at any given time.  To date, the crew have been tasked to respond to Safety of Life at Sea (Search and Rescue) events in the area of operation.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the mandate for the mission, the Naval Service could be involved in surveillance and intelligence gathering operations, search and rescue operations and disposal of migrant boats and Force Protection Operations.  A number of national caveats have been formally declared by Ireland and accepted by EU naval mission headquarters.  In this regard, Ireland will only participate in those aspects of Operation Sophia which are authorised in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions.</p></reply>

The benchmarks do not apply individually to Member States. The collective benchmarks were agreed by Ministerial Steering Board of the European Defence Agency back in November 2007.  Their inclusion in the PESCO Notification is therefore a restatement of existing commitments. </p>  <p>  In terms of the implications of this for Ireland, as we do not have a domestic defence industrial sector, it is unlikely that we will be a significant contributor in relation to defence research and technology investment.  That said there is some R&amp;T investment in research in the area of dual use capabilities and within the framework of the EDA. </p>  <p>  In relation to the commitment to regularly, increasing defence expenditure in real terms: as the Deputy will be aware, the allocations for defence for the period 2018 to 2020 announced in the budget, means that Ireland&rsquo;s Defence expenditure will increase in real terms over the coming three years. Beyond that we have given no commitment in actual expenditure terms. </p>  <p>  Similar to most other member States the allocation of resources to different votes, is a matter for national parliaments.  To that end, the notification clearly provides that the commitments will be implemented fully in accordance with the Treaty, its protocols and the constitutional provisions of the member states.  This language was secured by Ireland, with the support of many other member States, to give appropriate recognition to the legal and constitutional requirements of the member States in allocating national resources and funding.  The Notification also encompasses the Lisbon Treaty and its Protocols, including Ireland&rsquo;s protocol, as providing the context and framework for the implementation of the commitments. </p>  <p>As such the budgetary process and role of the Oireachtas remains intact and untouched.   </p></reply>

A certain level of turnover is desirable as a human resource and organisational objective, in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation.  However, it is also important to ensure that turnover is ultimately beneficial to the organisation.</p>  <p>  In recent years the levels of departures have exceeded intakes and this has presented challenges in meeting the establishment strength of 9,500 personnel.  To address vacancies, significant targeted recruitment has taken place in 2017 which resulted, to date, in 702 personnel being inducted comprising of General Service Recruits, Cadets and specialists for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  This figure is expected to reach approximately 800 by the end of 2017.    </p>  <p>  In addition to my commitment to maximising recruitment I am cognisant of factors that can influence retention of existing members of the Defence Forces.  I remain dedicated to ensuring that the terms and conditions of service, while remaining appropriate to the needs of the organisation, are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  I have recently announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study. In addition the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Following sign up by the Defence Forces Representative Associations to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, members of the Permanent Defence Force have benefitted from pay increases.  These post-dated the Climate Survey. I was particularly pleased with recent adjustments to salary scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 -2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold and this is under consideration by RACO and PDFORRA.</p>  <p>  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development.</p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.   </p></reply>

A total of 73 Focus Groups were conducted throughout the Defence Forces.  There were 603 participants in total.  The focus group report further explored the issues raised in the original survey.  The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management.  These include pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces),  vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance.  I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and I met with the Representative Associations on 13 July 2017, ahead of its official publication a week later. It is important to note that the focus groups were conducted in advance of the pay increases that were implemented in 2017.  These increases particular targeted the lowest paid across the public service.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 also provides a mechanism for further pay increases and is being considered by the Defence Forces Representative Associations. </p>  <p>  While work to progress many of the other issues raised was already under way as part of the implementation of the White Paper on Defence, I have directed that certain White Paper projects be brought forward and that work commence on these.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces and a range of initiatives are being developed including commissioning from the ranks, criteria for the re-entry of former Permanent Defence Force personnel with specific skills and consideration of increased use of direct entry for specialist posts.

In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role. The Government has also assigned a formal role to the Reserve of contributing to state ceremonial events.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.</p>  <p>  The strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve (as of 31 October 2017) was as follows:</p>  <p>  - Army Reserve: 1,733 effective personnel</p>  <p>- Naval Service Reserve: 123 effective personnel.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a shortfall between these figures and those of the establishment, which provides for 4,069 personnel.  The most recent recruitment campaign for the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications.  A total of 128 personnel have been inducted to the Reserve Defence Force in 2017 which is an increase of some 60% when compared to the 80 personnel inducted in 2016.  The recruitment process has also been streamlined so as to make it more efficient.</p>  <p>  Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing.  However, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both Permanent and Reserve Defence Force recruitment and the recruitment of up to 800 Permanent Defence Force personnel this year obviously impacted on resource allocation.   </p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two relate specifically to the RDF.  One addresses the issue of improving the strength of the Reserve by attracting recruits from all backgrounds.  The other action involves conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve. Both of these are well advanced. In the medium term, over the 10 year lifespan of the White Paper, other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will also be examined and developed by the Defence Organisation.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper on Defence and having regard to resource availability.   </p></reply>

The issue of housing and homelessness is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government, confirmed last week (6 December 2017) that the Government has approved an extra &euro;100 million for social housing for 2017</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a housing budget and does not provide homes or accommodation for retired personnel.</p>  <p>  My Department does recognise the valued public service given by former servicemen and women of the Defence Forces to the State.  As such, officials from my Department hold regular meetings with recognised veterans&rsquo; organisations including the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (O.N.E.), at which issues of concern to their members are discussed.  O.N.E. has enjoyed the long standing official recognition of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  As part of that process the Department has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with O.N.E. </p>  <p>  O.N.E. is dedicated to looking after the welfare of ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled members in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and other assistance that may be required. O.N.E. is a limited company with charitable status and has accommodation in Smithfield, Dublin (Br&uacute; na bhFiann with 30 places), Athlone (7 places),  Letterkenny (7 places) a drop-in centre in Limerick, and an advice centre in Dundalk.</p>  <p>  I am aware that O.N.E. is proposing to increase the number of advice centres in other locations such as Cathal Brugha Barracks, McKee Barracks, Casement Aerodrome, Custume Barracks, Finner Camp, D&uacute;n U&Iacute; Mhaoliosa Barracks and Stephens Barracks.  My Department is currently working with O.N.E. in this regard. Any retired soldier, male or female, may contact the Smithfield centre directly and O.N.E. will assist by directing the person to other facilities within the Health Services, the local authority services, or offer a room if vacant, in Dublin, Athlone or Letterkenny.</p>  <p>  As a charitable organisation, I am aware that O.N.E. is heavily dependent on fundraising to finance its operation.  In this regard, under the terms of the SLA, and as part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. to support and encourage its work. This subvention is currently &euro;44,000 per annum. The funding provided to O.N.E. by the Department of Defence is to support the general overheads of the organisation. It is not for the provision of services that are provided to citizens, including members of O.N.E., from other arms of the State such as housing, health, social assistance, etc. Dublin City Council continues to support, on an ongoing basis, the O.N.E. homeless initiative in Smithfield.</p>  <p>  I have also committed to meeting the recognised veterans associations, including O.N.E., on an annual basis and I provide support by attendance at specific events whenever I can.  This year on 28 June 2017, I had pleasure in attending the launch of O.N.E.&rsquo;s annual Fuchsia fundraising appeal.  I am advised that Defence Forces units and installations throughout the country undertake fundraising in support of the work of O.N.E. on behalf of veterans.  The military authorities encourage such fundraising as an illustration of the solidarity and bonds that exists between veterans and serving personnel.   </p>  <p>  The Defence Organisation and I are committed to continued engagement with O.N.E. into the future.</p></reply>

I have directed that a White Paper project to consider skills gaps across the entirety of the Defence Forces, be brought forward and commenced.  This will provide an opportunity not only to fully identify and prioritise skills gaps, but to identify how any gaps can be addressed. Operational demands, personnel requirements, consideration of work practices, and approaches to training and education must all be considered.</p>  <p>  I advised the delegates that I had listened to the concerns raised by their representatives in relation to the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I reiterated my intention to initiate a review of the scheme. This will be conducted in the course of 2018.   </p></reply>

The strategy sets the context and provides a guiding framework for the Union&rsquo;s external action under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The Strategy also identifies key security challenges facing the European Union within its neighbourhood and beyond, and commits to a global order based on international law with the United Nations at its centre.  Within the provisions of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the strategy commits the Union to take greater responsibility for its own security and to enhance its capacity to contribute to international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Following its publication, a comprehensive approach to implementation, including in the area of security and defence, is now being progressed.  As part of that implementation process, in June 2017, the European Council agreed to launch an inclusive and ambitious PESCO, as provided for in the Treaty on European Union, and to draw up a common list of criteria and binding commitments, within three months. </p>  <p>  Over the past several months, there has been significant engagement by all member States in the development of PESCO as is now set out in the PESCO Notification.  This included extensive discussions at official level through meetings of the Political-Military Group, the Political and Security Committee, and Defence Policy Directors and at Ministerial level at meetings of Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers. Ireland participated fully in these discussions, shaping the development of PESCO and the provisions in the Notification in a manner which ensured that PESCO was both inclusive and ambitious, fully recognising the differing defence policies of the member States as provided for in the treaties and their protocols. </p>  <p>  The final version of the PESCO 'Notification' was agreed by EU Member States on 13 November, 2017.  Following that agreement a Memorandum for Government was prepared.  Government approval was given on 21 November, 2017, for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO, and, for the moving of a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to approve Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO, pursuant to section 3 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>  <p>  Following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 07 December, 2017, and pursuant to Article 46(1) of the Treaty on European Union, Ireland then notified the Council and the High Representative, in her capacity as President of the Foreign Affairs Council and as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, of Ireland&rsquo;s intention to participate in PESCO.</p></reply>

This includes providing an inter-hospital service on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis to the HSE, providing for the transfer of patients, including priority 1 patients, to the UK using Air Corps Aircraft.</p>  <p>  The inter-hospital service is overseen by the National Aero-medical Coordination Centre of the HSE and the Air Corps is only one element of the overall service delivery provision; the Irish Coast Guard and the private sector being the other elements of service provision.     </p>  <p>  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise.  In the Air Corps the loss of experienced personnel led to the suspension of the standby roster for out-of-hours and weekend contingencies.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that during 2017 to end November, the Air Corps has carried out 28 Inter-Hospital Air Ambulance transfers to the UK at the request of the HSE, three of which were priority one transfers relating to children requiring urgent organ transplants. </p>  <p>  In the Air Corps, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities.  The retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally.</p>  <p>  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is a welcome development.   </p>  <p>  At Defence Organisation level, a Working Group comprised of Civil and Military personnel was established to look at ways of addressing the issue of how to retain sufficiently experienced Pilot Officers within the Air Corps.  The Working Group&rsquo;s report contained a number of recommendations ranging from increasing recruitment levels to examining the current terms and conditions of pilots.  Work on the implementation of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations is currently ongoing by both Civil and Military staff of the Defence Organisation.  In addition, and as part of a wider initiative, the possibility of recruiting former personnel who have left the Defence Forces is also being examined.   </p>  <p>  Two classes of Apprentice Military Aircraft Technicians began training during 2017.  Ten cadet pilots began their training in October with other cadet classes already in training.  Five cadet pilots received their &ldquo;Wings&rdquo; in October. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is significant action under way, there is a requirement to continue to build the capacity of the Air Corps and it will take some time for a return to previous levels of capability.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Air Corps will continue to provide support for emergency inter-hospital transfers on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis, having regard to available capabilities and its primary security responsibilities.   </p></reply>

This figure is expected to reach approximately 800 by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Particular challenges do exist in recruiting and retaining certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians.

I have directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill sets to re-enter the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff, the focus is on ensuring that the Defence Forces are staffed in manner that will enable them to continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.  Accordingly, I can confirm that further recruitment will take place in 2018 and plans for this are currently being finalised   between civil and military management.  Such recruitment will encompass general service recruits, cadets and specialists. </p></reply>

The strategy sets the context and provides a guiding framework for the Union&rsquo;s external action under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The Strategy also identifies key security challenges facing the European Union within its neighbourhood and beyond, and commits to a global order based on international law with the United Nations at its centre.  Within the provisions of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the strategy commits the Union to take greater responsibility for its own security and to enhance its capacity to contribute to international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations</p>  <p>  Following its publication a comprehensive approach to implementation including in the area of security and defence is now being progressed. As part of that implementation process, in June 2017 the European Council agreed to launch an inclusive and ambitious PESCO and to draw up a common list of criteria and binding commitments, within three months. Participation in PESCO which is provided for in the Treaty of the European Union was introduced under the Lisbon Treaty. </p>  <p>  Over the past several months, there has been significant engagement by all member States in the development of PESCO, including to ensure that it is fully inclusive, respecting the differing security and defence policies of the member States as reflected in the treaties and the treaty protocols.  Ireland participated fully across all fora in shaping the development of PESCO and in drafting the &lsquo;Notification&rsquo; to participate in PESCO, including the preamble, principles and commitments.  This included participation by my officials in extensive discussions at the Political-Military Group, the Political and Security Committee and at meetings of Defence Policy Directors. </p>  <p>  PESCO was also the subject of discussion at meetings of Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers. </p>  <p>  Discussions centred on the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach, encompassing foreign policy, trade, aid as well as security and addressed the need for PESCO projects to strengthen same and the requirement to also strengthen and reinforce civilian capabilities and crisis management tools. Regarding budgetary commitments, Ministers noted that commitments should not be seen nor presented as prejudging national parliaments' prerogatives in this area.  Ministers also discussed the governance structure whereby the decision-making process will remain in the hands of participating Member States and, also, the need for effective communication of PESCO to the wider public.  The importance of inclusivity and the need for respecting the differing security and defence policies of the member States, as reflected in the treaties and the treaty protocols, was also discussed. </p></reply>

I reiterated the firm Irish position regarding the text that I am satisfied was agreed on Monday.  We discussed our approach to finding a way to move forward and agreed to talk again.</p>  <p>  On Friday morning 8 December, I was pleased to announce that following long and intensive negotiations, we had reached a satisfactory conclusion on the issues relating to Ireland in Phase 1.  I said on Friday that we have achieved all we set out to achieve in Phase One of these negotiations.  We have the assurances and guarantees we need from the United Kingdom and support for them from the European Union.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that sufficient progress has now been made on the Irish issues.  The parameters have been set and they are good. Now, we can move on to work out the detail of what has been agreed and to talk about the transition phase, free trade and the new relationship between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  Assuming that happens, we can move on to the work necessary to convert the commitments made last week into the necessary provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement.  We also, of course, want to begin discussion about transition arrangements and the new relationship between the EU and the UK, in phase 2.</p>  <p>  We will remain fully engaged and vigilant throughout the next period of work.</p>  <p>  Throughout, we participated in these discussions as part of the EU 27.  Over recent days I have also spoken with European Council President Tusk and European Commission President Juncker on a number of occasions.  Irish officials were also in constant contact with the EU Task Force over the intensive period of negotiations in recent weeks, as well as engaging with the other EU institutions and Member States.</p>  <p>  We were also in bilateral contact with the UK at political and official level, including the contacts I had with Prime Minister May as I have mentioned already.  While these contacts were focused primarily on finding a way forward in the negotiations, Prime Minister May and I remain in agreement on the importance of ensuring close ongoing bilateral Ireland UK relations into the future.</p>  <p>  I was not party to any discussions between PM May and DUP leader Arlene Foster in respect of the EU UK negotiations, nor did I speak directly with the DUP leader over the course of the intensive negotiation period of the past two weeks.  As has been set out, the Article 50 process is a negotiation between the EU 27 on the one hand and the UK Government on the other.  As such, it is a process that involves sovereign governments rather than individual political parties in any of the relevant jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  In the same way, neither I nor my officials had a role in any decision made about sharing of draft text with the DUP.  Given the nature of the negotiation structure, this was entirely a matter for the UK Government. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that I was not involved in any direct discussions with the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill at this time.</p></reply>

I have been in frequent contact with Michel Barnier during this critical phase in the Article 50 negotiations. </p>  <p>  At the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 20 November, Mr Barnier provided an update to the EU27 Member States on the state of play with regard to the EU-UK negotiations and I also met with him in the margins of the Eastern Partnership Summit on 24 November.</p>  <p>  These contacts have supported Mr Barnier&rsquo;s efforts to achieve sufficient progress on the Irish issues and in securing a positive outcome for Ireland in the joint progress report agreed between Prime Minister May and European Commission President Juncker last Friday, 8 December.</p>  <p>  I met with Mr Barnier earlier this morning in Brussels and took this opportunity to thank him and his team for their excellent work to date in securing a positive outcome for Ireland and for the EU27 as a whole and welcome that he is now in a position to recommend to the Council that sufficient progress has been made on all phase one issues. </p>  <p>  Later today I will attend the General Affairs Council (Article 50), at which Mr Barnier will present the EU-UK joint report. I will take this opportunity to welcome that language on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the joint report from the negotiators of the EU and the UK Government reflects our goals of maintaining the Common Travel Area, protecting the Good Friday Agreement and North South cooperation and protecting EU citizenship and other rights.  </p>  <p>  In so doing, I will note that there is clearly still a great deal of work remaining on the Irish issues to ensure that all the commitments set out in this report are implemented.  I will therefore welcome that work on Irish issues will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the negotiations in phase two.  This will ensure that they will not be overlooked in the next phase.</p>  <p>  I will also express my hope that the European Council will agree to start discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship, and on transitional arrangements, as soon as possible. This is hugely important for Ireland and for the EU as a whole. </p></reply>

In the Council, the Government works with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical co-operation which are to our mutual benefit, and the Council oversees co-operation in the agreed twelve Areas or Sectors.</p>  <p>  In six of these Sectors, co-operation is taken forward by means of the North South Implementation Bodies:  Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, Special EU Programmes Body, North/South Language Body, and the Loughs Agency, all of which operate on an all-island basis.</p>  <p>  In the other six &ldquo;Areas of Co-operation&rdquo; - agriculture; education; environment; health; tourism (including Tourism Ireland Ltd.) and transport - common policies and approaches are agreed in the North South Ministerial Council but implemented separately in each jurisdiction.  Outside of the NSMC structure, good co-operation also takes place in other areas including energy. </p>  <p>  With the continuing absence of a functioning Executive, the North South Ministerial Council cannot operate and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee ongoing North/South work and further develop co-operation, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a most serious absence, and particularly so at a time when the Council should be continuing the work it commenced last year to deal with the challenges of the UK exit from the EU.  Common Principles were agreed at the Plenary meeting of the NSMC in November 2016, to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union. We should be working together on this through the North South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  In the context of the UK exit, a North South mapping exercise was undertaken during October and November 2017 between the EU Article 50 Taskforce, with the support of Irish officials, and the UK to map out areas of co-operation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland. It highlighted just how broad-ranging and varied that co-operation is.  The exercise demonstrated the extensive range of co-operation that happens, under the formal auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, including through the work of the six Implementation Bodies; between Government Departments in non-NSMC areas; and between agencies, regulators and other Government bodies.  The co-operation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary.</p>  <p>  North South co-operation brings very tangible benefits to the daily lives of people and, in particular, to those living in the border regions where it contributes to improving economic opportunity and development. It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to our mutual benefit.</p></reply>

The conflict, which is now in its seventh year, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  An end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  The UN is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  The eighth round of these talks is currently underway in Geneva. Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.</p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  The EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative aims to facilitate the peace process, build the capacity of opposition parties and contribute to dialogue with civil society in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU also provide support, including financial support, to a broad range of mechanisms to ensure legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict. </p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016 alone.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.4 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  At the Brussels conference in April 2017 which was co-hosted by the EU, a further &euro;3.7 billion for 2017 was pledged by the EU and its Member States, representing nearly 67% of the pledges.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in 2018.  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million this year. This is our largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years. </p>  <p>  Syria is not currently on the agenda for this week&rsquo;s European Council, however at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers discussed the regional situation in the Middle East, including of course the urgent need for progress towards peace in Syria. </p></reply>

If the peace negotiations are to be successful, this will happen at the end of the process, when the full set of compromises has been worked out.</p>  <p>  The dangerously heightened tensions in Jerusalem in recent years have also underlined the need to avoid any unilateral actions to alter the status quo in the city.</p>  <p>  I believe therefore that today&rsquo;s announcement by the United States in relation to Jerusalem is premature and ill-advised, and will be unhelpful to efforts to reach a resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something which is very urgently needed.  I conveyed to the US Government yesterday my concern about reports of US intentions, and I know that very many leaders around the world did the same. Today&rsquo;s announcement is thus very disappointing and difficult to understand.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully committed to supporting both parties to reach a peaceful, negotiated solution to the Middle East Peace Process, something which is essential for Israel to secure its future, and for Palestinians to enjoy their full political rights.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has restated that &lsquo;the aspirations of both parties must be fulfilled and a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states.&rsquo; I strongly support her words, and I believe that, despite this disappointing announcement by the US, the EU should redouble its efforts to help the parties to make progress towards a peace settlement. At the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, we had a wide-ranging discussion on the Middle East, which of course touched on the worrying impact of this US announcement. </p></reply>

However, this is ultimately a decision for the UK and, as of now, the UK government&rsquo;s stated position is that they will leave the Single Market and Customs when leaving the EU.  </p>  <p>  At the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, officials carried out detailed work over October and November to map out areas of co-operation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.  The exercise underlined the importance of maintaining full alignment with the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union necessary to continue and develop meaningful North South co-operation.  Through the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, North South co-operation has made a hugely important contribution to the improvement of people's lives on this island.  We want to ensure that this co-operation can continue in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  In the joint EU-UK report on progress issued last Friday, the UK asserts its commitment to protecting North South co-operation and to avoiding a hard border.  The agreement not only provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border in any circumstances, it spells out for the first time how this will be achieved.  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, paragraph 49 of the report states out that, &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo; It has also been agreed that any agreements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight.  </p>  <p>  The EU and the UK agreed that, in the next phase of the negotiations, work will continue on the detailed arrangements required to give effect to the principles and commitments that have been made.

This Study set out an ambitious range of strategies and collaborative actions aimed at maximising the competitive advantages of the island of Ireland, developing initiatives designed to boost economic activity on the island, and eliminating market distortions arising from the existence of the border.</p>  <p>  These included intervention in the education and training systems to enhance human capital; intervention to support research and innovation and the development of the knowledge economy; co-ordinated provision of key infrastructure; enhanced co-operation in the provision of health and educational services; enhanced co-operation in the provision of electricity and telecommunications infrastructure; and an improved regulatory environment.</p>  <p>  It was also envisaged in the Study that, in the area of infrastructure, more joined-up planning and delivery would give better outcomes for people throughout the island.</p>  <p>  In the intervening years, significant progress has been made in these sectors, including through the work of the North-South Bodies such as InterTrade Ireland and Tourism Ireland, and there are also strong business linkages between North and South.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the potential for trade and economic activity across the island of Ireland has not yet been fully tapped and that there is scope for increasing the levels of trade in both directions. In support of this, and particularly in view of the challenges presented by the UK exit from the EU, we clearly need to assist our SMEs in whatever ways we can.  This in turn can safeguard jobs, and encourage cross-border investments. InterTrade Ireland, for which the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility in this jurisdiction, is doing excellent work in this area.</p>  <p>  It is clear that it is more mutually beneficial to work together rather than separately, and the development of an all-island economy is in everyone&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  An all-island approach has already proved very successful in the Tourism sector, where Tourism Ireland has successfully marketed the island throughout the world. In the energy sector, the successful joint venture between Eirgrid plc and System Operator Northern Ireland (SONI) Limited has led to the Single Electricity Market &ndash; a wholesale electricity market operating across the island.</p>  <p>  With the continuing absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Executive, the North South Ministerial Council cannot operate and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee ongoing North/South work and further develop co-operation, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a most serious absence, and particularly so at a time when the Council should be continuing the work it commenced last year to deal with the challenges of Brexit.  Common Principles were agreed at the Plenary meeting of the NSMC in November 2016, to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union. We should be working together on this through the North South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government is continuing to work with the British Government, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to support the effective operation of all of its institutions, including the NSMC.</p></reply>

First and foremost, the relationship between Qatar and the other Gulf countries is an internal GCC matter, although it has wider regional and international implications.</p>  <p>  I note with regret that the recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council which took place on 5 December in Kuwait ended early, without the full schedule of meetings occurring. </p>  <p>  Ireland, like all EU Member States, has interests in the crisis in so far as it has the potential to impact on citizens, commerce and regional stability.  In tandem with our EU partners, we continue to encourage mediation to resolve this crisis, and we welcome and fully support the efforts of Kuwait in this regard. It is my hope that these efforts will continue, leading to a de-escalation of the tensions, and an early resolution, which is in the interests of the whole region.  </p>  <p>  As regards Saudi Arabia-UAE military partnership, given that both countries are currently engaged in military activity in Yemen, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my deep concern about the situation there, the suffering of ordinary people there, and the humanitarian crisis which the war has triggered. The ongoing fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians, with credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law, which all parties to the conflict must respect. Ireland will continue to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access to those in need. </p></reply>

Over recent weeks there has been a steady increase in recorded violations of the most recent truce with both sides continuing to ignore calls to pull back their heavy weapons from the contact line. Daily shelling has resulted in significant damage to critical civilian infrastructure facilities, in particular water and power supplies, as wells as schools and hospitals.  With no let-up in the fighting, little progress has been made this year on implementing the Minsk peace agreements.</p>  <p>  The EU remains fully behind efforts to secure implementation of the Minsk peace agreements within the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia and Ukraine) and the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine).  The Trilateral Contact Group continues to work on confidence building measures, including exchange of prisoners and disengagement from the contact line.</p>  <p>  In September, Russia tabled a UN Security Council resolution for the deployment of UN peacekeepers to protect the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM).  While this is a welcome development it remains to be seen if significant concerns over elements of the proposal, including Russia&lsquo;s insistence on a role for the separatists in the practicalities of any UN deployment, can be overcome.   </p>  <p>  The EU economic sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 for its role in destabilising Ukraine remain in place.  The duration of the sanctions is linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.  The measures run until 31 January 2018 and it is likely that Member States will agree to their roll over for a further six months given the lack of progress on the ground.     </p>  <p>  The EU remains fully committed to supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s continued delivery of its comprehensive national reform programme.  It is important to acknowledge the significant improvement that has taken place over the last two years.  No country has made as much progress as Ukraine on internal reforms and economic stabilisation while also dealing with an armed conflict on its territory.  The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement entered into force on 1 September, enabling the EU to further strengthen its cooperation with Ukraine and to deepen the country&rsquo;s political association and economic integration with the Union.  The fruits of this closer cooperation can already be seen.  In the past year there has been a 25% increase in two way trade and this growth is expected to continue in the future. </p></reply>

The Supreme Electoral Tribunal of Honduras has declared that, in the Presidential ballot, the incumbent President Juan Orlando Hern&aacute;ndez of the Partido Nacional de Honduras obtained 42.98% of the vote, against 41.38% for Salvador Nasralla, the candidate for the Allianza de Oposici&oacute;n.  The third placed candidate, of the Partido Liberal, received 14.73% of the vote.  The narrow margin between the two leading candidates corresponds to approximately 50,000 votes, of a total of almost 3.5 million.</p>  <p>  I am aware of complaints of irregularities arising following the vote, as well as reports of violence during protests in the aftermath of the elections.  I condemn unreservedly any acts of intimidation or violence perpetrated against those seeking to peacefully demonstrate or defend their rights.  In particular, I wish to condemn the loss of human life in recent days and to express my sincere condolences to the families of the victims.</p>  <p>  I echo calls made by the spokesperson of the EU High Representative Federica Mogherini last week for calm and restraint in Honduras in the aftermath of the election.  It is imperative that all sides act responsibly and work together, using the legal mechanisms available to them to address any potential complaints of irregularity regarding the electoral process, and to avoid violence at all times.    </p>  <p>  The EU deployed an Election Observer Mission to Honduras in October which consists of 22 long-term observers and 40 short-term observers.  Facilitated by my Department, Ireland has contributed one long-term observer and one short-term observer to this mission, the aim of which is to provide an independent public assessment of the election process.  I am pleased that Ireland was in a position to contribute to this vital work.    </p>  <p>  The EU Election Observation Mission released a statement last Thursday, 7 December regarding the post electoral situation, calling for fundamental freedoms to be respected and for violence to be avoided at all costs.  The statement welcomed the openness expressed by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal of Honduras to address any challenges made to the election result.  Crucially, the EU Election Observation Mission delegation is committed to remaining in Honduras and continuing its vital work to closely observe the election until the electoral process is fully concluded.</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Honduras, officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade raise issues relating to the protection and defence of human rights in Honduras both at EU and UN level, including through direct contact with the EU Delegation in Tegucigalpa</p>  <p>  On my instruction, we will continue to do so in light of recent developments in the country.  </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have also met with human rights defenders from Honduras, most recently in Dublin in October 2017, when the then upcoming elections were discussed in some detail.  Irish Aid contributes funding to programmes in Honduras through civil society organisations, chiefly Tr&oacute;caire, including in support of its important work on human rights. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to monitor the situation in Honduras closely as the post electoral process progresses into its next stages. </p></reply>

In this context, permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports is given only on condition that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.  All States, including the United States, must confirm that their aircraft meet these criteria.  These conditions reflect Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality and are strictly applied.  I share the deep concern as expressed repeatedly from all quarters in this House at the deteriorating situation in Yemen.  The humanitarian crisis in that country demands an urgent agreement on a full cessation of hostilities and immediate improved humanitarian access to those in need.  I again call on all of the belligerents to agree to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  At my request Ireland joined with a core group of countries at the UN Human Rights Council to drive forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen that establishes a group of international experts, who will examine allegations of violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.

The war is now in its third year, the political process has stalled, and the fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians, with credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law.  Yemen is also facing the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing cholera epidemic.  The recent death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh has led to a deterioration in the situation and an escalation in violence in parts of Yemen, particularly near the capital, Sana&rsquo;a.  The humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen has been exacerbated by the ongoing brutal conflict.  In addition to the loss of life, infrastructure has been destroyed, cutting off much of the population from food and other supplies.</p>  <p>  Ireland has close economic ties with Saudi Arabia, and this relationship has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.  However, this partnership does not prevent us from raising our concerns in the appropriate channels.  Over the past twelve months, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, has raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with Saudi Arabia and with UAE at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin last month, and they passed on my concerns in relation to human rights violations and humanitarian access, and re-stated Ireland&rsquo;s view that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Yemen.  In the past few days, the Embassy of Ireland in Saudi Arabia has also conveyed to the Government of Yemen that the reopening of Yemeni ports, including Hodeida particularly, for both humanitarian and commercial traffic, is essential to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>  <p>  I am committed to taking action where possible, through the UN system.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, I decided that Ireland should join a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen. This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access to those in need.  We fully support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to work towards a peace agreement.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I urged stronger action by the EU in relation to the barriers to humanitarian access in Yemen.  I will continue to raise my concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi authorities, as well as with other parties, and at EU and international levels, whenever opportunities arise. </p></reply>

The smoothest possible trading relationship will therefore require mechanisms to monitor and, if possible, resolve such regulatory divergence.</p><p>The second phase of the Article 50 negotiations will enable discussions to get underway between the EU and the UK on these important issues.  It remains Ireland&rsquo;s overriding position that a future EU-UK agreement should be comprehensive and ambitious and as wide as possible in its scope, while ensuring a level playing field and protecting the integrity of the Single Market.  It is also our position that an agreement should promote regulatory conformity, ensure ways to manage potential regulatory divergence, and impose the disciplines needed in order to ensure a level playing field. </p><p>In regard to Ireland, it is of course our strong preference that a broader EU-UK agreement will resolve all Irish-specific issues, including that of regulatory alignment between North and South.  However, in the joint progress report from the UK and the Commission published on 8 December there is a commitment from the British Government that, if the agreement does not achieve that goal, and in the absence of other agreed solutions in regard to protecting North/South co-operation and avoiding a hard border, it &ldquo;will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 [Good Friday] Agreement.&rdquo;</p><p>This backstop commitment is firm and wide-ranging in its scope.  &ldquo;Alignment&rdquo; is a term used in EU law in the context of adherence to the <i>acquis communautaire.</i>To &ldquo;maintain full alignment&rdquo; therefore requires the UK to continue to adhere to all elements of EU Internal Market and Customs Union law which supports the fundamentally important goals set out above.</p></reply>

We are fully committed to developing and enhancing this relationship over the coming years.  In addition, in the context of the UK exit from the European Union, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the European Union.</p>  <p>  During the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to London in May of this year, his first official overseas visit in office, Prime Minister May spoke of her desire to establish a &ldquo;close and special partnership&rdquo; with Ireland after Brexit.  We fully share this objective, and recognise that there can be no room for complacency in our relationship.</p>  <p>  Numerous channels will continue to exist for Irish-British engagement and both Governments continue to make extensive and effective use of these.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional cooperation on an east-West basis including through the British Irish Council (BIC). </p>  <p>  Other channels of contact and cooperation have developed over the years as the relationship between these islands has grown closer.  For example, in 2012, a process was established involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in both London and Dublin.  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.</p>  <p>  In addition, there have been a number of successful high-level visits in recent years that have had a very positive impact on our relationship, notably the state visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011 and the reciprocal state visit by President Higgins to the UK in 2014.  Most recently, President Higgins travelled to Dumfries House in Scotland at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, following the visit of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to Ireland earlier this year, their third visit in as many years. </p>  <p>  I recently welcomed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Dublin, providing an opportunity to discuss the importance of the bilateral relationship between the UK and Ireland and how this can be maintained and strengthened after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  Regular bilateral meetings between Irish Ministers and their UK counterparts facilitate cooperation across a range of portfolios.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in London will remain our largest bilateral Embassy globally, and this year two additional diplomatic officers have been assigned to the Embassy.  The Consulate General in Edinburgh was also assigned an additional diplomat in 2015.  &lsquo;Team Ireland&rsquo; enjoys a significant footprint in Britain with our trade, tourism, and investment agencies continuing to make a positive impact.  With 600,000 Irish-born, and as many as one in four of Irish descent living in Britain, the Irish community continues to be recognised for its positive contribution to modern British society.  In this context, there are over 60,000 Irish-born Directors of British companies. </p>  <p>  It is clear that there are a wide range of arrangements in place to allow for constructive and mutually-beneficial dialogue with the UK and the continued strengthening of the British-Irish relationship.  The UK has always been one of our most important bilateral relationships.  It is up to us to continue to strengthen this relationship and to find areas for sustained cooperation.  I believe that the structures, the warmth and goodwill, and the excellent working relationships needed to maintain a strong bilateral relationship are in place and will continue to grow and develop.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department have recently met with NGOs operating in the Golan, and remain in contact with them.</p>  <p>  In the occupied Syrian Golan, as in the West Bank, the introduction and settlement of communities of the occupying power, to alter the demography of the area, is illegal under international law.  The process of establishing settlements inevitably involves violations of the rights of the occupied population, through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions.  Tactics including planning laws, zoning, military use, national parks etc. are used by the Israeli authorities to advance this process under a cloak of legality.  None of these measures can alter the fact that the whole process is illegal.</p>  <p> The Government has consistently and repeatedly conveyed these concerns about land use, demolitions and settlements in general to the Israeli authorities, and highlighted them in our interventions at EU, UN and international level.  In addition, I raised these concerns directly in the context of my visit to Israel and Palestine in July, and I raised them again with Prime Minister Netanyahu in our meeting with him in Brussels on Monday.  I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity to pursue them.  In general, we address these issues in relation to the occupied territory as a whole, seeking to improve the protections of all the people living under that occupation, including in the Golan area. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where the continued construction of settlements on occupied land is dangerously undermining the prospects for a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state, and this has been the focus of my international engagement on the settlements issue, both bilaterally and at EU level.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria.  This does not lessen the obligation on Israel to treat the community there in accordance with international law so long as the occupation remains in being.</p></reply>

However, devolved power-sharing government can only operate on the basis of an agreement reached between the two largest parties.  The other parties represented in the Assembly - which have shown considerable patience - also have a critical role to play.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that, after several phases of negotiations in different formats, we still do not have an agreement to form an Executive.  The issues under discussion &ndash; particularly those on language and culture &ndash; go to the heart of the divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  However, I have always believed that it remains possible to reach an agreed outcome which ensures implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself - partnership, equality, and mutual respect.  It remains my conviction that this is achievable.</p>  <p>  With the continuing absence of a functioning Executive, the North South Ministerial Council cannot operate and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee ongoing North/South work and further develop cooperation, as provided for under the Agreement.  This is a most serious absence, and particularly so at a time when the Council should be continuing the work it commenced last year to deal with the challenges of Brexit.  Common Principles were agreed at the Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in November 2016, to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union.  We should be working together on this through the North South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and determination, as a co-guarantor of the Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Taoiseach and I continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give full effect to that commitment.</p></reply>

Furthermore, there are financial service companies which manage an account and relationship between a retailer and various card schemes known as acquirers.  Acquiring is a competitive market in Ireland, there are a range of options available to merchants from which to choose, including banks, bank subsidiaries and other payment institutions.  If a merchant is not satisfied with their acquirer, they could stand to benefit from shopping around and choosing a different acquirer for their business.</p>  <p>  My role is to ensure that there is an appropriate framework in place for the resolution of complaints in the financial services sector, including complaints about the refusal to provide a service.  The person concerned may wish to make a formal complaint regarding this matter to the bank in question and the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 sets out timeframes within which a regulated entity must respond to complaints. </p>  <p>  If a customer has made a formal complaint to the financial service provider in question and is not satisfied with the outcome, I would suggest that they make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman who may investigate a failure or refusal to provide a service.

The Group recommended that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years having regard to the pressures on the public finances. </p>  <p>  However, in his 2015 review of the LPT conducted at the request of my predecessor, Dr Thornhill considered that this recommendation in favour of deductibility does not rest easily with the concept of the LPT as a tax on the amenity value of residential properties rather than as a business cost.  He contended that owners and tenants of rental properties both derive value from the amenity value of these properties, the owner in the form of the rent and the tenant from living in the property.  This Dr Thornhill considered contrasts with the situation regarding local authority rates on commercial properties.  Owner occupiers are not allowed to claim LPT as a deduction against income tax and it is not appropriate on conceptual and equity grounds that they should.  There is a need to ensure equity between owners of all residential properties &ndash; whether owner occupiers or landlords.  Dr Thornhill recommended, after further reflection, that it would be inappropriate to allow LPT as a deduction against the taxation of income from rents on residential properties.</p>  <p>  My Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of the outstanding recommendations in the 2015 Thornhill Review of LPT in due course in line with the 2019 revaluation timeline.  The position of the Government will be made clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.

This passporting facility is of great benefit to many Irish authorised insurers who sell into the markets of other EU member States.</p><p>All motor insurance undertakings wishing to do business in Ireland are required to become a member of the national bureau (Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI)) under Section 78 of the Road Traffic Act.  This is an important requirement as the MIBI is the body in Ireland tasked with meeting the EU requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  MIBI publishes its membership list on its website.  This contains the details of all undertakings that are allowed to sell motor insurance in Ireland, whether authorised in the State or elsewhere in the EU.  The list is available at:</p><p><i>www.mibi.ie/_fileupload/Member%20list/7%20MIBI%20Members%20List%20-%20September%202017.pdf.</i></p><p>When looking at the membership list, the Deputy will note that the freedom of services undertakings are marked by a reference to &ldquo;FOS&rdquo; in the company code field of the table.  There were some 26 such undertakings in the latest membership list, from September 2017.  These numbers may change as undertakings enter and exit the Irish market from time to time.</p><p>In addition, I am informed by the Central Bank that it has a register of insurance undertakings which have notified of their intention or obtained an administrative authorisation to carry on Non-Life Insurance business into Ireland, on a Freedom of Services basis.  This is publicly available at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>However, as it includes all undertakings, not just those providing motor insurance, I think the MIBI membership list will be of more assistance to the Deputy for the purpose of his question.</p></reply>

The purpose of the tax clearance scheme is to ensure that businesses and individuals that derive an economic benefit from the State are in compliance with their tax obligations.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it also operates a wide-ranging compliance management programme to address tax compliance risk in all its forms.  The compliance behaviour of a taxpayer determines the nature, extent and consequences of Revenue&rsquo;s risk management interventions which range from aspect queries and profile interviews to Revenue audits, and prosecutions, both summary prosecutions and serious criminal investigations.  Targeted annual projects include the construction and property rental sectors.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s work and focus in regard to offshore matters has been strengthened by greater co-operation and information sharing between tax authorities worldwide.  Revenue is now receiving details of offshore assets and accounts held by Irish tax-residents under a range of international agreements including the Inter-Governmental Agreement to share financial account information with the United States (FATCA), the OECD Common Reporting Standard, and the EU Directives on Administrative Co-operation.  </p>  <p>  Revenue uses software to match the data that it receives from other tax administrations to Revenue&rsquo;s taxpayer records, then cross-checks against prior returns to ensure relevant income and assets have been declared.  Revenue also feeds the data into its social network analysis and anomaly detection tools, to highlight cases where possible tax compliance risks may arise and such cases are then the focus of specific Revenue intervention as part of its ongoing compliance intervention programmers. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the aforementioned new information sharing initiatives and developments, the Government introduced specific measures in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that, as and from May 2017, tax defaulters whose default relates to offshore matters are unable to avail of the benefits of the voluntary disclosure regime.  Anyone who did not come forward by 4 May 2017 to regularise his or her tax affairs now faces the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible criminal prosecution.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the combination of Revenue&rsquo;s risk identification and evaluation  processes, its extensive access to relevant and expanding data sources and the overall tax clearance underpinned by a strong legislative regime that penalises and sanctions offshore tax evasion are an effective framework for tackling tax non- compliance.</p></reply>

Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold (when aggregated since 5 December 1991) CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. </p><p><b>Group A</b>: tax free threshold &euro;310,000 &ndash; applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B</b>: tax free threshold &euro;32,500 &ndash; applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C</b>: tax free threshold &euro;16,250 &ndash; applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where two people, irrespective of their relationship share a home owned by one of them, and where the homeowner dies leaving that home to the other person, they can in certain circumstances be exempt from the payment of inheritance tax in respect of the inheritance of that dwelling house.  The main conditions attaching to this exemption are that the person who inherits the dwelling house must have lived there for a minimum of three years prior to the inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling-house.  The dwelling house passing by inheritance must also be the sole or main residence of the disponer.  In addition, with the exception of persons who are aged 65 years or over at the date of the inheritance, he or she must continue to live in that dwelling-house, as his or her only or main residence, for a period of six years commencing on the date of the inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be liable to inheritance tax when it is the subject of an inheritance.</p><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of tax as a separate and unconnected individual.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.  From a practical perspective a CAT regime for cohabitants which would be the same as for married persons or civil partners would be difficult to administer and is likely to be intrusive.  It would be time consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were cohabitating or when cohabitation started and ceased.  </p><p>As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status.  There would be a significant Exchequer cost with the extension of the Category A threshold to individuals with no children and it would be likely to give rise to tax planning opportunities. </p><p>Finally, I would say that the current CAT structure is a long standing feature of the tax system which has been agreed by the Oireachtas.  The system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.  I therefore have no plans to amend the rules applying to CAT in the manner sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p>  <p>  The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including:</p>  <p>  - That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable.</p>  <p>  - That the property was the homeowners primary residence at the time of the floods.</p>  <p>  - That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home.</p>  <p>  - That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme.</p>  <p>  - That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future at an economically feasible cost through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time.</p>  <p>  - That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p>  <p>  The OPW are working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to identify the homes that flooded during the event, and of those identified which properties may not benefit from a known or possible engineering solution. These homeowners will be invited to meet with the OPW to discuss the details of the scheme and may be invited to formally apply for the scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the identification process underway with the Local Authorities, homeowners also had the opportunity to express an interest directly with the OPW, before July 28th 2017, to be considered under the Scheme. Some 67 expressions of interest were received from homeowners in 19 different Local Authority areas.</p>  <p>  The OPW has begun to make contact with those homeowners identified above and individual meetings will commence this week. It is not known how many of the people identified are farmers but the OPW is taking note to share details with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine of applicants whose home is part of an active farmyard.</p>  <p>  In applying the scheme, where an engineering solution is identified that would protect the home from a flood of similar intensity, at more economically advantageous cost than relocation, the OPW will provide funding to Local Authorities to complete these identified works.</p>  <p>  With regard to a potential Voluntary Farm Building Relocation Scheme, the study to determine the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation has been commenced.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is using its own records of applicants who sought aid under the emergency relief package, that operated in response to the flooding during the Winter of 2015/2016, to identify potential candidates for any Voluntary Farm Building Relocation scheme. In addition, that Department will use details supplied by the OPW, from applicants to the Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme, to identify further potential applicants. That Department will then contact and work with these individual farmers to determine if there are any alternative remedial works to protect those farmyard buildings at risk and develop recommendations in relation to the feasibility of a scheme.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. </p><p>This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website <i><i>www.education.ie</i></i>.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The System uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. It is anticipated that decisions based on the latest demographic exercises will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>The first phase of the school building project for the school referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied was completed in January 2014.  The second phase of the building project is currently at Stage 2A - Developed Design Stage.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that post-primary school building projects for Beaufort College, Boyne Community School and Scoil Mhuire, Trim are included in my Department's Construction Programmes.  The project at Beaufort College is currently under construction and the architectural planning process for the project at Boyne Community School has commenced.  A site visit has been undertaken at Scoil Mhuire as part of the preparatory work associated with advancing the building project.</p><p>With the addition of these projects, based on the demographic and enrolment information currently available, there should be sufficient provision for post-primary school places in County Meath.</p><p>My Department is keeping the school planning areas in County Meath under ongoing review to take into account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of capacity increases in the school planning areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-12a.317.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121200078#WRF05100"><p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  This has been used to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers including a 15-22% increase in pay which I negotiated last year.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on 12 October 2017.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. </p><p>In this regard, a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion.  For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. </p><p>This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>In relation to the school in question I can confirm that the construction of a new 1,000 pupil Post Primary School in Kingswood commenced on 28<sup>th</sup>August 2017 and that, subject to no issues arising, the school, which comes under the remit of the ETB, should take 24 months to complete.  Temporary accommodation was provided on site to allow the school to open in September 2016.</p><p>All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to enrol children from within the designated school planning area which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, as set out in Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual students, the SENOs take account of the student's needs and considers the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the students from its current level of resources.

This is known as Risk Assessment.  The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work.  The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of the employer's Safety Statement.</p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: "Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it.  Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided.  Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place."</p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending.  Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.  It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.</p>  <p>  The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p>  <p>  This Working Group, which is chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack, Chairperson of the NCSE Council, has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this, a cross Departmental Working Group has been established to develop proposals in relation to the need for nursing supports in schools for children with complex medical needs.  This Cross Departmental Working Group has to date held a number of meetings. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, until any changes are agreed, the responsibility for funding Nurses, irrespective of where they are located, is the responsibility of the HSE and they also remain responsible for the clinical and professional governance of the nursing profession in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to insurance, the position is that the nature and terms of an individual school&rsquo;s insurance arrangements are a matter between the individual school and its insurers.</p></reply>

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size.</p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 45 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 46.03 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016/17.</p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for schools.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised that this appeal would consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017.  An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation.</p>  <p>  Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31 2017.  These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded.  The school mentioned did submit and appeal and were informed of the outcome in August 2017.</p>  <p>  A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p>  <p>  Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  Schools were also advised that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status.</p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  The school referred to by the Deputy in this question has submitted a request for a review under this process and the NCSE will be in contact with the school regarding this request in the near future.</p></reply>

Denmark participates in the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement aspects of this Regulation by virtue of a separate agreement between that country and the EU and the provisions in the instrument relating to applicable law and cooperation between Central Authorities do not apply in relation to that Member State.  The UK, which, unlike Ireland, opted into the Regulation after its adoption, also does not participate in the applicable law provisions.</p>  <p>  The Maintenance Regulation explicitly provides that the law applicable to maintenance obligations is to be determined in accordance with the Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the law applicable to maintenance obligations in the Member States bound by that instrument.  The Hague Protocol was approved on behalf of the European Community (as it then was) pursuant to a Council Decision dated 30 November 2009 which further provided for the provisional application of that Protocol to maintenance claims in a Member State as and from 18 June 2011.

Given the nature of such an inquiry, namely one to be carried out by a judge of the superior courts who will have the powers, rights and privileges vested in a judge of the High Court, it cannot be considered to be an ordinary complaints or grievance procedure.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority Customer Charter states that a person who is unhappy about the standard of service is encouraged to raise the matter with the staff member concerned.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers taking account of projected retirements, will increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018. </p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. </p><p>I am informed that the breakdown of the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; this year is as set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Newly attested Garda assigned in 2017</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

There are currently a number of such prisoners in the care of the Irish Prison Service who have significant and ongoing healthcare needs, many of whom are currently dispersed across the estate and in some cases significant distances away from the healthcare providers they rely on.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the unit will allow the Irish Prison Service to accommodate such prisoners in an adapted unit within close proximity to a variety of medical care facilities. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the repurposing of the unit will take between 12 to 18 months to complete.  As such it is the intention of the Irish Prison Service that this facility will open for older prisoners in 2019.</p></reply>

The next step will be for the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a Memorandum for Government on the formal ratification process which will happen at the latest in the new year. </p>  <p>  The Government also approved the publication of draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty for public consultation.  The draft legislative provisions outline proposed safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and certain categories of people with mental health issues to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities. </p>  <p>  Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights.  Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts.  It is important that people fully understand what is being proposed.  For this reason I am inviting submissions from stakeholders and the general public by way of public consultation until 9 March 2018. </p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention's requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate manner.  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the 'Make Work Pay Group' was published in April of this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris, has been taken on its recommendations. </p>  <p>  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 has seen positive action measures being taken to support public sector recruitment of people with disabilities.  I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of this year containing wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  I am further informed that ratios such as the number of Garda per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources as they fail to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 38, 20 and 20 have been assigned to the Cork City Division, the Cork North Division and the Cork West Division respectively.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, will increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018.  </p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Co. Cork Divisions.  </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of personnel including Reserves and civilians assigned to the Co. Cork Divisions as of 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set below.</p><p>Strength of County Cork Garda Divisions as of 31 October 2017<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Garda   Strength</th><th>Reserve</th><th>Civilians</th></tr><tr><td>Cork   City Division</td><td>662</td><td>44</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   North Division</td><td>317</td><td>14</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   West Division</td><td>291</td><td>10</td><td>24</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The purpose of the initiative is to ensure a visible Garda presence and to provide a higher degree of security integrity at the biggest multi-level base port in the State.  Operation C-Port commenced in September 2016 and comprises a 24/7 Garda presence at entry and exit points to Dublin Port and immigration control checkpoints, in conjunction with targeted initiatives.  </p><p>Operation C-Port ensures that relevant legislative and regulatory provisions are observed by persons having business in or passing through Dublin Port and its environs and preventing unlawful entry into the State.  This is achieved by providing foot / cycle / mobile patrols and a high visibility Garda and multi-agency enforcement presence at the Port and in its environs.</p><p>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deployed under Operation C-Port, perform the following duties:</p><p>- a 24-hour visible presence at points of entry to and exit from Dublin Port; </p><p>- immigration duties at passenger ferries, cruise-liners, roll-on / roll-off, bulk freight, load-on / load-off vessels landing at Dublin Port;</p><p>- enforcement of the Road Traffic and Road Transport Acts and Regulations, together with relevant bye-laws, focusing on the Dublin Tunnel and Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs);</p><p>- crime prevention, through overt and covert patrols of Dublin Port; and</p><p>- enforcement of National Security through border protection duties and the protection of national infrastructure.  </p><p>Under Operation C-Port, joint border management initiatives, in conjunction with personnel from the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), regularly take place.

This Strategy contains 149 Actions, grouped under ten themes, which are as follows:</p><p>- Cultural Identity; </p><p>- Education;</p><p>- Employment and The Traveller Economy; </p><p>- Children and Youth; </p><p>- Health;</p><p>- Gender Equality; </p><p>- Anti-discrimination and Equality; </p><p>- Accommodation;</p><p>- Traveller and Roma Communities; </p><p>- Public Services</p><p>I chair the Steering Group which has the responsibility for monitoring and achieving progress on the implementation of the Strategy.  The Steering Group consists of representatives of the Traveller and Roma communities, as well as of representatives of relevant Government Departments and Agencies. </p><p>Since the launch of the Strategy, the Steering Group has met twice, on 2 August and on 18 October.  The next meeting is planned for Wednesday 13 December.  The meetings provide an opportunity to review progress and to drive forward implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>To date, work has begun on approximately 100 of the actions in the Strategy.  The Steering Group will continue to monitor progress on these Actions and to focus on actions where progress has not yet commenced.  It is a priority for me that the momentum achieved to date is maintained. </p><p>The following specific Actions which are included in the Strategy:</p><p>98.  The Department of Justice and Equality will support the development of community leadership in gender equality with men and women from the Traveller and Roma communities with a view to developing gender equality.</p><p>112.  Members of the Traveller and Roma communities will be supported in the reporting of racist crimes.</p><p>117.  The Department of Justice and Equality will support the development and delivery by Traveller and Roma organisations of initiatives aimed at challenging homophobia and transphobia within the Traveller and Roma communities including support for Traveller and Roma families who have children/partners coming out.</p><p>With regard to Action 98, my Department has provided increased funding of &euro;55,000 to the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum in 2017 to assist the organisation in promoting the gender equality actions contained in the NTRIS with a view to further developing Gender Equality in the Traveller and Roma communities.  Further discussions will take place during 2018 between this Department and the national Traveller and Roma-focussed NGOs with a view to the promotion of the gender equality actions contained in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021. </p><p>On Action 112, I understand that the former Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office has recently been subsumed into the Garda Bureau of Community, Diversity and Integration. It has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  The GBCDI monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. </p><p>Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with the GBCDI play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GBCDI and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary.</p><p>Existing Irish law is in compliance with the EU Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia as regards online hate speech.  This is, however, a complex area to legislate for and any further proposals for research in this area would have to take account of the review carried out under the auspices of the National Action Plan against racism in recent years and would have to take cognisance of best practice in the Cybercrime area.</p><p>Finally, for Action 117, my Department will work with Traveller and Roma NGOs in 2018 with a view to providing the support necessary for the delivery of the initiatives concerned, as described in this Action. In this regard, my Department will commence work in the New Year on the drafting of a new National LGBT Strategy, which will also contain recommendations in this area. </p></reply>

This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed at that time by both sides, the official side and the Garda representative associations, and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance, that the new arrangements should apply to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving on, or after, 1 October 1976.  By extension these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to that date.  Generally speaking, these Agreed Reports provide that a Garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have superannuation benefits accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal, preserved until the member reached 60 years of age.  </p>  <p>  The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.</p>  <p>  Similar arrangements have also been introduced in pension schemes across the public sector with varying &lsquo;cut-off&rsquo; dates depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests. </p>  <p>  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed.  It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit. </p>  <p>  My Department has consulted the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and has been advised that the position remains that it is not possible to resolve a case individually on an administrative basis and provide an individual with preserved benefits without changing the terms of the scheme retrospectively.  Such amendment would, in equity, have to cover all public servants who resigned prior to the effective date applicable to their schemes.  That Department has further stated that changing the various schemes to change the cut-off date is not a practicable proposition. </p></reply>

It has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy however that it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.   There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.   </p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect in August 2015 provides an improved framework in this area for employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining. The 2015 Act provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place. </p>  <p>  The Act ensures that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. It provides definitions of key terms as well as guidelines to help the Labour Court identify if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer, and policies and principles for the Labour Court to follow when assessing the comparability of the remuneration and conditions in dispute.</p>  <p>  I trust that this information is helpful to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur, while imports from Mercosur, particularly in Agriculture, are currently subject to high tariffs.  The proposed FTA should make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products. </p>  <p>  Within the region, Brazil is Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partner with total exports from Ireland of &euro;715 million and total imports of &euro;634 million in 2014.  Brazil has been highlighted as a &lsquo;High Growth Market&rsquo; in the Enterprise Ireland Plan 2016, with Enterprise Ireland client&rsquo;s companies&rsquo; exports value increasing by 84% from 2012 to 2014. In 2014, Ireland exported in excess of &euro;950 million to Mercosur countries, with services representing approximately 60% of the total exports and Chemicals accounting for 49% of Irish exports to Mercosur.  132 Enterprise Ireland client companies exported to Mercosur in 2014.  Year on year growth of exports to the region from 2013-2014 increased by 25%.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, Ireland has strong concerns in relation to agriculture, especially the impact that these negotiations present to the EU beef sector.  While all Free Trade Agreements include agriculture tariffs, agricultural market access and TRQs (Tariff Rate Quotas), TRQs provided under such agreements are not always fully utilised by our trading partners.  Equally, most Member States tend to have sensitivities in relation to certain goods or services to be comprehended under an FTA.</p>  <p>  Ireland has continued to highlight the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all trade agreements.  We have done this through engagement with the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels, as well as joining with other Member States in formally writing to the Commission outlining our concerns.  Both my predecessor as Minister and my colleague Minister Creed have also raised the matter in various fora.</p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland remains fully committed to this negotiation, especially in view of the important economic and political gains expected for both sides from a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.  However, any TRQ offered must be structured - in terms of its size, composition and the application of in-quota tariff rates - in a way that mitigates the potential impact of a Mercosur deal on the EU beef sector. </p>  <p>  As negotiations are ongoing, it remains unclear what the final outcome will be, although it must be acknowledged that for the Mercosur countries offers on EU agricultural produce are essential to securing any deal.  In that regard, a further round of high-level talks is taking place the week beginning the 12th December and negotiations are led by the EU Commission on behalf of Member States.</p></reply>

A further round of high-level talks on the EU-Mercosur FTA took place from 29 November to 8 December 2017.  The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of the EU Member States in Trade negotiations.  </p>  <p>  An EU-Mercosur FTA would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, and would be four times the size of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, which was recently concluded.  An EU-Mercosur trade agreement aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur, while imports from Mercosur, particularly in agriculture, are currently subject to high tariffs.  The proposed FTA should make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products.   </p>  <p>  EU law requires all relevant EU policies, including trade policy, to promote sustainable development.  Sustainable development has three pillars: economic, environmental and social.  The EU Mercosur FTA has a defined section on sustainable development which includes climate change.  A Sustainability Impact Assessment being carried out on the EU Mercosur FTA will also have a designated section on climate change as part of its environmental analysis.  </p>  <p>  The precautionary principle is enshrined in the EU treaties and all EU trade agreements must respect those treaties.  The EU ensures that all its trade agreements fully respect the right to regulate on the basis of the precautionary principle.  Trade agreements must also uphold existing EU food safety regulations and other 'secondary legislation' which includes the precautionary principle. </p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland remains fully committed to this negotiation, especially in view of the important economic and political gains expected for both sides from a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced EU-Mercosur Association Agreement that will be good for a range of Irish exporting companies and jobs.  However, we also have to be mindful of the cumulative impact of EU FTAs on specific sectors, such as agriculture, and the challenges which they face if having to respond to competition on multiple fronts in a comparatively short space of time.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. </p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services. Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review. </p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies. The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities. </p>  <p>  As the remainder of the Deputy's relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The HPRA has stated that Hormonal Pregnancy Tests (HPTs) such as Primodos and Duogynon were never authorised (i.e. licensed) for use in Ireland.  However, it is understood that Duogynon was available in Ireland up to the 1970s, with distribution discontinued in 1978.</p><p>Although never authorised for use in Ireland, the 1975 annual report of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB, a predecessor of the HPRA) outlined the consideration given by the NDAB to the use of hormonal testing for pregnancy.  This report related to hormonal pregnancy testing preparations in general, and did not mention any specific product.  In April 1975, the NDAB issued a warning letter to practitioners regarding the use of hormonal pregnancy testing preparations.  This letter reminded practitioners that these preparations had not been assessed by the NDAB, and that their use as a means of pregnancy testing had not been accepted by the NDAB. The letter also highlighted that these preparations should be avoided, as a firm statement of safety could not be given and other, more efficient methods of pregnancy testing were available. </p><p>While not an authorised medicinal product in Ireland, five reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with use of Duogynon were received by the NDAB between 1976 and 1980, describing suspected congenital abnormalities.  There is very limited information available in relation to these reports. </p><p>The HPRA has no information regarding the numbers of women in Ireland who may have used Duogynon for diagnosis of their pregnancies in the 1970s.</p><p>In the UK, where HPTs were licensed (and where they were used from the early 1950s to 1978), an Expert Working Group of the UK&rsquo;s Commission on Human Medicines recently completed a review of this issue and published a report on the use of hormone pregnancy tests (HPTs) and adverse effects relating to pregnancy, including possible birth defects.  This report concluded that following extensive and rigorous review, based on the totality of the available data, that the scientific evidence does not support a causal association between the use of HPTs such as Primodos and birth defects or miscarriage. </p></reply>

The Executive has responsibility for implementing its mental health Budget as part of its Service Plan, including agreed service priorities at national or local levels.  In this context, further delegation is a matter for the Executive.</p>  <p>  The Accountability Framework within the HSE also provides an administrative framework of delegated authority, which currently provides for delegated budget accountability from the National Director of Mental Health to a Chief Officer at Community Health Organisation level.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with the report recently published by the HSE on mental health services in Roscommon, including a recommendation that the HSE should consider delegating budget authority further down its organisation than is currently the case.  The  Executive has established an Implementation Team to follow through on the recommendations of this Report.</p>  <p>  At this time and bearing in mind all the circumstances, it is not considered that any legislative amendments along the lines suggested by the Deputy are necessary in relation to any recommendation of this report.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  I remain hopeful to be in receipt of this legal advice before year end and I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.  Any proposed changes will require primary legislation and I hope to be in a position to progress this in early 2018.</p></reply>

Teleconsultations can potentially provide easier access to health services in certain circumstances, in a primary care setting for example, such as in remote locations or for chronically ill patients.  It can also be of assistance to have health practitioners communicate virtually between each other.  Such consultations are simply another channel of service, similar to GP-patient phonecalls.</p><p>There currently are no technological barriers to teleconsultations being made available for widespread use within the context of the health service.  The Department are aware that some teleconsultation solutions are currently being offered in the private health sector.  When delivering remote health services, providers must ensure the integrity of patient data, as required by current data protection law and the forthcoming implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018.</p><p>Telemedicine linkages between patients and primary care professionals as well as between primary care settings in hospitals have significant potential to improve access, efficiency and patient centredness.  The provision of services by telemedicine is already the subject of specific guidance to doctors from the Medical Council through the <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics. </i>An implementation plan for the Sl&aacute;inteCare Committee report is being finalised which will see in coming years significant opportunity to further develop telemedicine services to enhance accessibility, responsiveness and efficiency of provision of primary and secondary healthcare services.</p></reply>

The action undertaken this year included additional activity within our paediatric hospitals, which was facilitated by the staff recruitment campaigns this year, and outsourcing initiatives to hospitals at home and overseas.  For the first time in a number of years, the waiting list for scoliosis-related surgery is reducing.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed  to supporting the HSE to continue to bring down the waiting times and improve access to scoliosis services, and progress continues on reducing numbers waiting and waiting times in a planned, safe and sustainable manner.  The four-month target set by the HSE for long waiters this year has driven the progress that has been made and the Director General of the HSE has indicated that the 4 month target will be maintained for 2018 measured from when the person is determined as needing surgery.  A Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design Group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive contemporary and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.  I had a fruitful meeting with this group recently to discuss their work to date.  The work of the Co-Design Group will form the basis for developing scoliosis services into 2018 and beyond.  The Group is expected to develop criteria for surgery based on clinical grounds and national and international best practice to ensure that children/young adolescents have surgery when clinically indicated for their individual case and within a time period that does not cause clinical deterioration of their condition, as opposed to within an administrative fixed timeline or target.</p>  <p>  Further investment in paediatric orthopaedic services next year is being considered in the context of the 2018 National Service Plan discussions.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  The price that some companies are seeking to charge means that the innovative products may never reach the patients as health systems cannot afford the price.  In many case the main driver of the price is an estimate of the maximum amount that health care systems can pay and is not connected to the health benefit of the treatment or indeed the development costs.</p>  <p>  These high costs cause unnecessary delays in the reimbursement process.</p>  <p>  In many cases the price submitted is an artificially high price which will be reduced following rounds of resource intensive negotiations.  For example, in 2015 price reductions were negotiated for almost two thirds of medicines that underwent a full health technology assessment.</p>  <p>  When the decision is taken not to reimburse a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline . This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to reconsider their decision.  The HSE must then consider those representations and it is only after then that they make a formal decision.</p></reply>

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  The issue of orphan medicines, with very small patient populations,  and the price barriers for health systems in supplying them to patients, is world-wide.  Orphan product manufacturers have exclusive patents and are monopoly suppliers.  They can, and frequently do, seek very high prices for these products.</p>  <p>  The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments.  However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas. In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 Framework Agreement with industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Criteria which must be considered include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs.  However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and in such cases this must be sought.  Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought by the company, lengthy price negotiations between the HSE and the manufacturer may be needed.  These factors contribute significantly to the length of the reimbursement decision making process.</p>  <p>  A new Committee called the &ldquo;Rare Diseases Medicinal Products/Technology Review Committee&rdquo; was established in June 2017 by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  The terms of reference for the Committee have been finalised and  the responsibilities of the Committee include the review of proposals for funding of new products for rare diseases or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases.  The composition of the Committee will ensure that the voice of patients, patient groups and clinical experts will be available to the HSE when considering reimbursement of drugs for rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The Committee will also contribute to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products and support the implementation of same. </p>  <p>  Dr. Michael Barry was appointed the Chair of the Committee on the 13 September 2017. It is expected that Committee will begin its work in early 2018 after appointment of the necessary support staff.</p>  <p>  With the potential costs involved and the competing demands across the health service, every effort must be made to secure the best outcome for the health service and the taxpayer.  This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.</p></reply>

Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit. </p>  <p>  In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise Hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to my Department in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of detailed engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to my Department in September 2017. </p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in my Department.  Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties, to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise, will have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government   acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite, which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise and separately, facilitates families to receive a break from caring.  Respite services may vary, according to the assessed needs of the individuals and their carer.  The model of respite is changing and although some still require overnight respite, others prefer and benefit from day respite.  The number of respite nights has been reducing as persons with disabilities are seeking alternative models, such as day respite or extended day.</p>  <p>  The most recent available data from the HSE indicates that for 2016, 175,555 overnight respite sessions and 43,143 day sessions were accessed.  It is planned that 161,262 overnight respite sessions will be accessed in 2017.

It is primarily a school based service with the aim of supporting teachers and parents in meeting the needs of learners in schools.  In assigning psychologists to Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna, NEPS has some 58 staff identified as competent in the delivery of service through the medium of Irish.  For a number of years NEPS has provided an Irish language programme for its Psychologists with the assistance of Gaeleagras Teo. and an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG).

In this context and with reference to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the relevant report, the Department of Health published <i>Food and Nutritional Care in Hospitals &ndash; Guidelines for preventing Under-Nutrition in Acute Hospitals</i>in 2009.  These Guidelines included a recommendation on using a nutritional screening tool, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST).</p><p>Currently the Department is working with the HSE on the development of the <i>National Clinical Guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of under nutrition: Use of Nutrition Support in adults in the Acute Care Setting.</i>This is to ensure use of the MUST tool in all Irish Hospitals and make it a mandatory requirement for all patients to be screened on admission to hospital.</p><p>The HSE is also addressing the issue by establishing a multidisciplinary hospital food and nutrition policy development group.  This group includes representation from the chairs of the Nutrition and Hydration Steering Committee from a hospital within each Hospital Group.  The HSE has employed a Project Dietitian with specific skills and experience in the area of hospital food/menus to lead on the development of a National Hospital Food and Nutrition Policy and Implementation Plan.  This policy will be supported by the Acute Hospital Division and the Health and Wellbeing Division.</p><p>The Food and Nutrition Policy and Implementation Plan will include minimum nutrition standards and refer to other relevant policies, such as protected meal times policy, the use of oral nutritional supplements, nutrition screening and referral pathways.  Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS) are designed to prevent and treat under-nutrition.  Evidence of their efficacy is underpinned by expert clinical guidelines including those of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).  There is increasing evidence of their cost effectiveness compared to standard care, arising largely from reductions in use of acute care resources.</p><p>I also understand that the Department is carrying out a health service Capacity Review which will have a wider scope than previous exercises which concentrated on just acute bed capacity.  This Review will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  It has involved a major data gathering exercise in relation to activity, un-met demand and capacity within the acute, primary and social care services sectors, analysis of that data, baseline forecasting of both demand and associated capacity requirements for each health sector and consideration and modelling of the potential impacts of policy change and productivity improvements.  The Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity needed.  The findings will also inform the development of a new 10 year national capital plan.  Work on this Review is at an advanced stage and a final report is expected early in the new year (2018).</p></reply>

The Communication proposes a simpler CAP, with a sharper focus on objectives and results, particularly in the environmental area.  I welcome the commitment that Direct Payments should remain an essential part of CAP, as they provide an important safety net for family farms and ensure there is agricultural activity in all parts of the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Communication outlines a number of possibilities that should be explored to improve the targeting of direct payments, including compulsory capping of payments, degressive payments and redistributive payments to small or medium size farms.  It also suggests that support is targeted to genuine farmers, focussing on those who are actively farming in order to earn their living.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the Communication but of course detailed proposals will only emerge in the context of legislative provisions to be presented by Summer 2018.</p>  <p>  Degressivity involves the reduction of payments above a certain threshold.  Under the current CAP, degressivity was possible for payments exceeding &euro;150,000.  Ireland has effectively decided to limit the maximum amount payable to an applicant under the Basic Payment Scheme (excluding the Greening Payment) to &euro;150,000 per annum by applying 100% degressivity after that amount, as provided for under Article 11 of Regulation 1307/2013.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the 2016 Programme for Government, proposed a lowering of the cap on basic payments from &euro;150,000 to &euro;100,000.  An opportunity to address this issue may arise in the context of the proposed CAP Reform.</p></reply>

The timing of expenditure is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led multi-year schemes, a different level of participation in some schemes than anticipated, the pattern of drawdown of Grants by State bodies, the levels of disease incidences and payment of compensation, etc.  </p>  <p>  As mentioned by the Deputy, the Department&rsquo;s expenditure at the end of November was behind profile by &euro;128.5m, of which &euro;87.6m is current and &euro;40.9 is capital.  Some of this amount arises in budget lines such as pay, research and the sheep welfare scheme where we are now certain the full allocation will not be required this year.  In other cases some of the expenditure profiled for earlier months, though delayed, may arise before the year end.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this month I sought and received permission from the Dail via the supplementary estimates process to reallocate funds from some areas where savings were certain to provide funding  for existing schemes such as GLAS and ANCs and new initiatives particularly in relation to Brexit and  the World Food Programme.  Most of this extra expenditure has not yet taken place so it is not reflected in the end of November figures.   </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s staff are fully focussed on ensuring that scheme payments are made to eligible recipients in all schemes and in this regard the submission of Nutrient Management Plans will be an important factor in maximising payments for GLAS in 2018, which is the scheme with the most significant amount of funding yet to be paid.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-12a.936.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121200089#WRR03500"><p>Firstly I want to welcome the Report recently published by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and will be writing directly to the Committee on foot of their report in due course.  The Tillage Sector is a very important sector to the agricultural economy, making a vital contribution to both the food and feedstuffs sector and in this connection I want to highlight the actions my Department has undertaken this year to assist this vital sector.  </p>  <p>  I introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in January of this year and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  The banks have advised that all of the &euro;150m available under the scheme has been committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.  I announced in the Budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.  </p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The second tranche of support under this scheme closed on Friday the 6 October 2017.  There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector with a total number of 687 applications now received (including most recent tranche) and 457 approvals have now issued with payments and approvals continuing on an ongoing basis.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures on the 26 July 2017 in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops.  This measure provides for a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.  </p>  <p>  Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50% will benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare, on the same area.</p></reply>

The NIFF is representative of the fishing boats of less than 12 m overall length in the fishing fleet.  The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for policy development including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy for the inshore sector.  </p><p>To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.  Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has a say on how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.</p><p>The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.  Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.  In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018.  </p><p>With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.  For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.  Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.  A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.</p><p>There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.  An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.  This catch limit is recommended each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives.  For 2017, under 18 m Boats may fish 5 tonnes per month.  In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.</p><p>The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.  In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)  of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, a system of fixed penalty notices  (&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences.  This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices.  </p><p>In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.  If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.</p><p>A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.  Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.  There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.  In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction such a system.</p><p>With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres.  The network of Harbours, located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, are a valuable and vital resource to the Irish fishing fleet.  The Fishery Harbour Centres provide state of the art facilities and infrastructure for the increasingly mobile and large scale Irish and EU fishing industries.</p><p>In 2017, I allocated a total of &euro;3.8 million to the Local Authority Programme.  This vital funding targeted 67 approved Local Authority projects with a wide geographical spread, 55 of which are harbour development requiring funding of &euro;2.94 million and 12 relate to marine leisure requiring funding of &euro;879,750.  The infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.</p><p>With regard to progress on aquaculture, in May 2017 I published the report of the Independent Review Group on aquaculture licensing which contained 30 key recommendations across a full range of activities.  Additional staff have been assigned to the Aquaculture licensing division of the Department so as to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations.</p><p>My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.  The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 schemes including specifically in relation to Fisheries Local Action Groups.Individual schemes are administered by BIM and I will ask BIM to update the Deputy on recommendations relevant to its remit.  </p><p>In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government is fully commitment to the seafood sector and the coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.</p></reply>

We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach.  Indeed, the Taoiseach raised the matter in the course of recent meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that no agreement on a Mercosur deal has been finalised at this point, although the Commission did make an offer to Mercosur during the October round of negotiations which included a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) for beef.  I was deeply disappointed that the Commission decided to submit this beef TRQ offer, as I believe that this could not be coming at a worse time for the EU beef sector.  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 24 November and 1 December, and I have raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels on 6 November. I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns.  I also wrote to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in early October, reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of the beef TRQ offer.    </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations; I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.  Against this background I will continue to build alliances with other Member states and to defend the interests of the Irish and EU beef sectors.  </p></reply>

This sustainability and efficiency will be achieved through improved nutrient management with more targeted use of fertiliser, better farmyard practice, more widespread use of sustainability approaches developed by Teagasc and the development of new approaches to reducing nutrient losses in critical source areas.</p>  <p>  Through a commitment from both the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and support by industry, the 30 Advisors will work within a unified partnership structure which encompasses Teagasc, the Co-ops and the local authorities Water and Communities Office (LAWCO).  The new Sustainability Advisors will proactively advise and work with farmers to protect and improve water quality.  The Programme will draw on the experience and resources of key sectoral and industry stakeholders including the two Departments, the local authorities, the Dairy Co-ops, Teagasc, Bord Bia and the farm organisations.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme, the new team will promote on-farm sustainability best practice to all farmers.  In addition, local authorities - with the technical support of the Environmental Protection Agency - will identify risk areas at local level.  Teagasc and the Co-ops will then provide advice and support to farmers in managing on-farm risks, working also with local farm organisations.  The Co-ops will support sustainability best practice through their structures, promoting best farm practice and nutrient management processes across all their suppliers.</p>  <p>  The Programme has the potential to strengthen delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Water Framework Directive.  It is part of a new approach to River Basin Management Planning for the 2018 &ndash; 2021 cycle.  This new approach includes the development of a much-strengthened evidence base to understand the full range of pressures affecting water quality and the development of the programmes of measures needed to deliver improvements.  Over time, the Programme will also address on-farm climate change and biodiversity strategies.</p>  <p>  The Programme will be jointly funded by both Departments, Teagasc, local authorities and the Dairy Co-ops on a trial basis for four years to 2021.  My staff are incorporating oversight of this programme as part of their existing work programme.</p></reply>

Our records indicate that no greyhounds have been directly exported from Ireland to Asia to date in 2017.

The project is part of a broader strategic framework funded by my Department to encourage research and development in the agri-food sector.  The inclusion of a large number of topics relating to food in my Department&rsquo;s recent Call for Research Proposals very much underscores my commitment to this effort.  Publicly funded research is now even more necessary to help drive innovation, competitiveness and long-term sustainability in the food sector as we prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s expected that the National Food Innovation Hub will be instrumental in increasing the rate of research and innovation in the dairy sector and wider food industry.  Whilst my Department has no plans to fund similar projects at other locations, a major package of measures was announced in Budget 2018 to help the food industry navigate the current challenges arising from Brexit and to advance the growth objectives of Food Wise 2025.  For example, in the areas of innovation, research and new product development an investment of &euro;5m is planned to fund research and innovation in the important Prepared Consumer Foods Sector.</p></reply>

These policies, approved by the Board of IFI, were developed by two working groups which included <i>inter alia</i>representatives from the main Trout and Pike Angling Federations.</p><p>A review of these policies was scheduled to commence in 2017.  However, recognising the views of some stakeholders in relation to elements of the policies, the Board of IFI decided to bring forward the review period and commence the process in 2016 with a public consultation process.  The public consultation process was held in November 2016 through which more than 300 submissions were received.</p><p>One of the most important issues considered in the previous policies relates to the management of pike in designated Wild Brown Trout fisheries.  In late 2016, a Review Group, across all disciplines in IFI, was established to specifically consider this issue.  The Review Group met with Pike and Trout representative bodies in January 2017 following which representatives from a number of these organisations were invited to join the Group.</p><p>In May 2017, the Group, including the pike and trout angling representatives, met for two information gathering meetings at which a number of expert scientists made presentations.  The Review Group subsequently reviewed and assimilated the data and information provided during the two information gathering meetings.  The Group reconvened in September 2017.</p><p>The presentations delivered to the Group, along with minutes of the meetings and the public consultation submissions, are publicly available on the IFI website: www.fisheriesireland.ie.</p><p>IFI have advised that the report of the Review Group is expected to be finalised in 2018.  Therefore, no proposals have been made as regards relaxing pike controls or any other matter.  Decisions on any change in the management of Pike and Trout will be made as soon as possible after the Group reports.</p><p>I want to emphasise that while the policy review is underway, delivery of current IFI pike management practices has continued in line with the existing policy.  Therefore, there has been no change to current policy or practice regarding the management of pike in designated wild brown trout fisheries.  Stock management operations are normally commenced in February each year and IFI will continue to implement stock management programmes, in line with current policy.</p></reply>

These sub-milestones cover the tasks that are required to deliver high speed broadband to premises within the Planned Rural Deployment area.  A detailed definition of each sub-milestone is provided in the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>Following evaluation by officials from my Department of eir's Q3 progress report I can confirm that eir has met its Q3 2017 milestone of 101,000 premises passed.</p><p>There is provision within the Commitment Agreement for the re-designation of the LIGHT BLUE areas as State intervention areas.  The Commitment Agreement provides the Minister with the right to change the Intervention area and incorporate premises from the LIGHT BLUE area into the AMBER area where eir fail to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement.</p><p>There is no commitment agreement in place with commercial operators for the BLUE areas of the High Speed Broadband Map.  However, my Department continues to monitor deployment progress and any issues that arise.  Where commercial plans to provide access to high speed broadband to premises within a BLUE area do not materialise, it is my intention that the implementation of the NBP will ultimately overcome these issues and that all premises will be able to access high-speed broadband services.</p><p>Through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce practical initiatives will continue to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The measures currently offered under the Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Warmer Homes Schemes (WHS) were selected as the best balance that could be achieved between the limited resources available to the schemes, the number of homes that can receive support and the energy savings that can be delivered.  In short, the measures supported under the BEH and WHS are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people.  While upgrading windows and doors does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of these measures is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made.</p>  <p>  In the case of deep renovation of homes, window upgrades are eligible for funding under the Deep retrofit programme, which funds 50% of the cost of getting a home to a Building Energy Rating of A3 or higher.  The same level of funding is available for window and door upgrades under the Better Energy Communities scheme, when carried out as part of deep retrofit. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I also announced that homes with particularly low thermal efficiency, that qualify for the Warmer Homes Scheme, will also now be eligible for a deeper retrofit package in addition to the currently funded measures; this could include windows and doors if deemed necessary at point of survey.  Additionally, under the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing pilot scheme, which is led by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health, energy efficient windows and doors are installed wherever a surveyor deems them necessary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also note that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government funds the Housing Aid for Older People scheme.  This scheme is administered by Local Authorities and provides grants to older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Eligible works include repairs to (or replacement of) windows and doors.</p></reply>

The increased funding will allow rollout of a number of key programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system to address congestion in the greater Dublin area and I would like to set these out as follows.</p>  <p>  The four-year capital envelope for public transport includes investment of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term.  This programme, which was launched earlier this year by the National Transport Authority (NTA), is a plan to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for passengers by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  It represents a reimagining of bus transport for the Dublin region.  At the heart of this proposal to develop continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations.  Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of next year.  The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign and the Core Bus Corridors including specific routes and corridors.</p>  <p>  The four-year capital envelope for public transport will also enable increased investment in the order of &euro;130 for sustainable transport projects in our main cities including Dublin.  This investment is aimed at traffic management measures, bus priority and other smarter travel projects in order to allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and to ease traffic congestion. </p>  <p>  Over &euro;110 million will also be invested in new urban cycling and walking routes in our main cities, including Dublin, which will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport. </p>  <p>  Around &euro;230 million is being provided to progress DART Expansion and associated mainline rail enhancements.  This will enable acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focusing on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of both the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan and the Maynooth line.  Notwithstanding the funding constraints over the last few years, a major upgrading of the City Centre Re-signalling programme was progressed and is already well advanced to completion.  Furthermore, limited design work has been carried out on electrification of the Northern Line to Balbriggan to date.  Following the additional funding announced as a result of the capital plan review, it is intended to reactivate the design and planning work for this project during 2018. </p>  <p>  I wish to also advise the Deputy that in the interim, the NTA, in conjunction with Irish Rail, continues to examine short and medium term options for meeting increased commuter demand on the Northern commuter line.  This includes reconfiguring existing maintenance practices and refurbishment of existing rolling stock that can be put into service in 2019 coupled with the commencement of a procurement process to invest in a new fleet to meet longer terms demands.</p>  <p>  As a follow-on project from Luas Cross City, I was delighted to recently announce plans for the Luas Green Line Capacity Enhancement Project which will commence in 2018.  The purpose of the project is to address current capacity limits at peak hours on the Luas Green Line and to cater for future demands.  This will include lengthening of the existing Green Line tram fleet and the purchase of additional trams to meet future passenger demand.  In advance of this Luas capacity enhancement project, a complementary project to lengthen the platforms at Green Line stations has already been successfully carried out. </p>  <p>  While a longer term solution to address congestion in the greater Dublin area, the 4-year capital envelope progresses preparation of the Metro North project. Construction work on this project will start in 2021, with passenger services starting in 2027.  The 10-year capital plan to be published in the coming months will include the funding for the period to complete this significant addition to public transport.</p></reply>

The overall DART Expansion Programme has a key role to play in delivering an efficient transport system.  When fully implemented the enhancements to the heavy rail system provided for in the NTA's Transport Strategy will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected.  This integrated rail network will provide the core high capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Hazelhatch and Greystones.  The original cost of the overall DART Expansion Programme (including the DART Underground Tunnel element) was estimated at &euro;4 billion, of which &euro;3 billion was in respect of the tunnel as originally designed.  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution.  I understand that the NTA's work on this is expected to be completed soon.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s budgetary framework for capital investment, as set out in Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, was reviewed earlier this year in the context of the Mid-Term Review of capital priorities, delivery and funding.  Following this work, Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for public transport investment between 2018 and 2021.  This includes funding in the order of &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement.  As announced, this will allow acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focussing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line. The remaining elements of the DART Expansion programme are being considered in the context of the 10 year investment plan that is expected to be published in the near future.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Authority for further information on the issue raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

It is expected that by 2023 approximately 500 buses will be converted to low-emission vehicles, with plans for full conversion by 2030.</p>  <p>  Commuter rail and light rail have been steadily building on the already widespread use of electricity as fuel.  Funding of almost &euro;460 million to 2021 will be invested in light rail projects including the Green Line Capacity Enhancement Project which, in addition to the recently completed Luas Cross City project, will add capacity to the light rail network in Dublin through additional and longer trams.  Funding is also being allocated to progress new Metro North and the funding required to complete this major project will be provided by the 10 year capital plan due to be published by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  &euro;225 million will be invested in heavy rail projects over the next 4 years including the City Centre Resignalling Project in Dublin which will improve speeds through the city centre and the new Central Traffic Control Centre which will help progress the DART Expansion Programme and also generally improve rail movements nationally.  Additional funding will also increase the rail fleet and allow further progress to be made on the electrification of both the Northern rail line to Balbriggan and the Maynooth line.</p>  <p>  &euro;5.5m is allocated in 2018 and &euro;29m from 2019-2021 for the Carbon Reduction Programme which funds measures to support decarbonising the transport sector.  A "Green Public Transport Fund" will support the uptake of low carbon technologies within the public transport sector.  This Fund will assist the transition of the national bus fleet to low emission technology by, inter alia, supporting pilots, covering the price differential between the cost of a conventional diesel bus and the cost of an alternatively fuelled vehicle, as well as refuelling infrastructure.  Furthermore, the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland was published in May to support the deployment of alternative fuels for transport in Ireland and assist in removing any barriers that exist towards greater uptake of low emissions vehicles.</p></reply>

This arrangement has given rise to safety concerns at these specific locations, with the possibility of bicycle wheels becoming caught in the grooves of the tram tracks.</p>  <p>  Because of these concerns the NTA, as sanctioning authority, is requesting TII to erect signs advising cyclists not to cycle along the relevant sections.  In the city centre, this includes Grafton Street (between College Green and Nassau Street), Nassau Street (between Grafton Street and Dawson Street) and the north end of Dawson Street.    </p>  <p>  I am informed that, trials abroad for installing a rubber insert, or similar, into rail grooves have not been successful, with the material becoming ripped and dislodged by the tram wheels during operation.  Therefore, the NTA does not propose to use that approach.  An alternative approach which would provide a satisfactory long-term solution has not yet been identified to the NTA that would provide a hazard-free surface along tram lines, while accommodating significant tram, bus, taxi and cyclist movements. Collaboration is ongoing between NTA, TII and the City Council and will guide the future approach to this matter.</p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred your question to the NTA for a more detailed reply with regard to the issues raised.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-12a.1155.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121200093#WRV03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458, 459, 467, 468, 470, 472, 477 to 479, inclusive, and 484 together.</p>  <p>  It is important to be clear that there has been no withdrawal, or proposal to withdraw, any ECCE provision for children with disabilities.  All children will be eligible to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision.  The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities.  No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved.  This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.  If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:</p>  <p>  -  ECCE provision currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018.  This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities.  Over 4,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the programme.  This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.  The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based.  Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:</p>  <p>  -  expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010.</p>  <p>  -  providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. </p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education.  The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers. </p>  <p>  The original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers.  There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers.  The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns.  To this end, as stated above, I have paused the proposed change and committed to consulting more widely with parents of children with disabilities.

Applications for such exemptions must be submitted in writing to the DCYA, and must include a letter of recommendation from a medical specialist (not a GP) supporting the application for the child to avail of the overage exemption. </p><p>The figures below set out:</p><p>-  Total applied for 2016/2017 </p><p>-  The number of approved applications for 2016/2017, </p><p>-  The numbers of unsuccessful applications due to lack of medical recommendation paperwork for 2016/2017.  On occasion parents or service providers have made an application for an overage exemption but neglected to supply the required letter from a qualified medical specialist.  In these cases officials from my Department have made contact with the parents requesting the submission of this letter.  However, if no letter of recommendation is forthcoming, my Department has been unable to proceed with the application process.</p><p>-  Total approved for 2017/2018</p><p>-  The number of approved applications for  2017/2018, and,</p><p>-  The number of applications awaiting the medical recommendation paperwork for 2017/2018 programme year.  (Please note that we keep those applications pending until we hear back from the applicant or until the programme year is closed). <table><tr><th>2016/2017 - Approved</th><th>2016/2017 - No medical recommendation supplied</th><th>2017/2018 - Approved</th><th>2017/2018 - In Process (Incomplete applications-No Medical Paperwork) (Applications are still open for this programme year)</th><th>2018/2019 - (Pre-approved) </th></tr><tr><td>447</td><td>25</td><td>434</td><td>58</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total Applications: 472</td><td></td><td>Total Applications: 492</td><td>Total Applications: 6</td></tr></table></p><p>Traditionally under the ECCE scheme, an overage exemption was made available in cases where a child had special needs and required the ECCE year (then 38 weeks only) to be split over two years.  Children approved for this measure merely split their entitlement over 2 years, attending for 2 days per week for the first year and 3 days per week for the second year for example. </p><p>An overage exemption did not change the entitlement to the number of ECCE weeks therefore it was intended to be a cost neutral measure'.  My officials are currently examining whether any additional expenditure was incurred.</p></reply>

My Department acknowledges that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector and can lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. </p>  <p>  My Department is somewhat constrained in what it can do in this regard as it is not an employer of childcare workers.  However it is of course a major funder of the childcare sector. It is important to note that the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector are recognised employers and employee groups. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that trade unions are active in seeking to achieve a critical mass of representation on the employee side and, I welcome this move.  My Department would also be supportive of any move on the employer side to establish a recognised representative body. </p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that it might apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector. </p>  <p>  Under an SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  While my Department would have no direct role in relation to the SEO process, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, it would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the application for a SEO for the sector.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the last three Budgets have increased investment in Early Years by some 87%.  This has helped us to address affordability, access and quality, although I recognise that there is more to be done.  This year's announcement of a 7% increase in ECCE capitation is intended to support the workforce.  The &euro;18m in 2017 to support 'non-contact time' or the administration burden associated with the scheme, is also intended to support providers and their employees.</p>  <p>  I will be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions of the Early Years sector.  While I don't have a direct control over the matter, I will continue, with my Department, to support any appropriate initiatives in this area.</p></reply>

All children will be entitled to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision. The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities.  No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved.  This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.  If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development.  The two main enhancements are:</p>  <p>  -  ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018.  This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities.  Over 4,000 children have so far benefitted from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme.  This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.  The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based.  Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:</p>  <p>  -  expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010.</p>  <p>  -  providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. </p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education. The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers. </p>  <p>  The original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers.  There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers.  The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns.  To this end, as stated above, I have paused the proposed change and committed to consulting more widely with parents of children with disabilities.  I have also committed to having this consultation completed by mid 2018.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. </p>  <p>  Level 1 of AIM is the critical foundation for the model and sets out to foster and embed a strong culture of inclusion to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE programme.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.  AIM was launched in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The oversight and delivery of all seven levels of AIM supports require input from staff across the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and Health and from a range of agencies/organisations (including City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs), Early Years Specialist Services, Health Services Executive, Mary Immaculate College Consortium, National Council for Special Education, National Disability Authority and Pobal).  Many of these staff perform this role as part of their core work.  Therefore, it is not possible to separate the AIM-related payroll, overhead, travel and subsistence and management costs from the core costs for many of these staff.</p><p>-  &euro;1.065m has been allocated to CCCs in 2017 for operational costs associated with AIM Levels 1 and 3 (An Inclusive Culture and Information for Parents and Providers).  This allocation includes provision for payroll costs, overhead costs, travel and subsistence and management costs.  The bulk of the allocation is to cover the cost of the national roll-out of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Training Programme, the roll-out of AIM information sessions and the provision of AIM-related supports (information or otherwise) to parents and providers.</p><p>-  &euro;5.890m has been allocated to Pobal in 2017 for operational costs associated with AIM Level 4 (Provision of Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support).  This allocation includes provision for payroll costs, overhead costs, travel and subsistence and management costs.  The bulk of the allocation is to cover the cost of employing 60 (WTE) Early Years Specialists, 7 coordinators as well as providing management and administrative support.</p><p>-  &euro;1.736m has been allocated to Pobal in 2017 for operational costs associated with AIM Levels 1 (An Inclusive Culture), 5 (Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alteration Grants) and 7 (Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room).

All children will be entitled to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision.  The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities.  No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved.  This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.  If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development.  The two main enhancements are:</p>  <p>  -  ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018. This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme.   This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.  The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based.  Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:</p>  <p>  -  expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010. </p>  <p>  -  providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. </p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education.  The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers. </p>  <p>  The original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers.  There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers.  The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns.  To this end, as stated above, I have paused the proposed change and committed to consulting more widely with parents of  children with disabilities.  I have also committed to having this consultation completed by mid 2018.</p></reply>

DCYA officials indicated in the response that the individual should provide additional information if she is in a position to do so; to date DCYA has had no further contact from the person concerned. </p>  <p>  New regulations were introduced for the Early Years sector in June of 2016.  Part 3.9.4 of these regulations established a minimum qualification standard for those working directly with pre-school children.  This qualification standard was introduced following extensive consultation with the Early Years sector, and the intention to introduce a minimum qualification standard was announced as far back as 2013.  It was broadly welcomed as being in the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  Extensive funding was made available over a period of four years to allow sector workers to undertake, upgrade or update their qualifications.  To facilitate those who had many years experience in the sector but were unwilling or unable to pursue new training, a 'grandfathering' clause was included in the Regulations.  Those wishing to avail of the option of signing a 'grandfathering' declaration were able to do so through their local County/City Childcare Committee (CCC), but as is standard with such derogations, the option was available only up to a certain point in time.  'Grandfathering' declarations must have been signed by the 30th June 2016, at which point the regulations commenced.  This is itemised in Part 3.9.6 of the regulations. </p>  <p>  The qualifications minimum standard as provided in the Regulations commenced on the 1st of January 2017; again, the interval between the commencement of the regulations and the commencement of the section pertaining to qualification standards was allowed following consultation with the Early Years sector. </p>  <p>  After the 1st of January 2017, anyone working directly with pre-school children in an Early Years service must meet the minimum regulatory standard.  DCYA cannot issue permission for anyone to continue working with pre-school children if they do not meet the minimum regulatory standard, even if it is the case that further training is now been undertaken; such an action would see DCYA being in breach of it's own regulations. </p>  <p>  The Tusla Early Years Inspectorate is responsible for inspecting Early Years services for the purposes of compliance with the minimum regulatory standards and any instance of non-compliance should be raised with this Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the current regulations apply only to pre-schools services.  The regulations do not apply to after-school services.</p></reply>

However, I believe that it needs to be reformed to ensure that it delivers the best possible outcomes for children.  To this end, I am examining carefully how best to strengthen it. </p>  <p>  Any reforms will be informed by the ESRI review of the Programme, which acknowledged its great contribution to vulnerable children, but which pointed to the need for an improved governance structure and revised model of employment. </p>  <p>  In particular, I want to ensure that services under the Programme are compliant with financial and governance rules, and that we have a good model of service delivery throughout the country.  I also want to ensure that those employed under the Programme have clear contracts of employment and that their work is properly coordinated. </p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to an effective reform of this programme, not only in relation to the governance and employment issues, but also the programmes, supports and processes that are in place to ensure that young people complete school.  I am reviewing the extensive consultation process that has been carried out. I am considering recommendations from the expert panel that Tusla has established to consider possible options for reform.  I also plan to consult with experts across the educational welfare sector before making any decisions. </p>  <p>  In my view the reform will incorporate universal supports as well as targeted supports to ensure that those most in need are reached by the programme.  It is critical that we have a whole school approach to this, as well as ensuring that other child and family supports, delivered by statutory or voluntary agencies, are integrated so that the child or young person has the best chance of staying in school.  I am also committed to incorporating recognition of the strengths and capabilities of the child or young person into these reforms.  I believe that the emotional stability young person is critical in enabling their engagement in learning, and contributes to their desire to finish school. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, Tusla's Educational Welfare Service has taken important steps to support the current service, including arranging independent Human Resources and Industrial Relations advice, and contracting with other parties to support governance, training and continued professional development of staff. </p>  <p>  I believe that the School Completion Programme deserves careful reflection and analysis so that we achieve the best possible reformed services for children.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to 627,318 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2017.  Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  The current estimated annual cost of extending the upper age limit for payment for those persons who are 18 years and under 19 years of age and in secondary school, based on figures from the Department of Education and Skills, is over &euro;62 million.</p>  <p>  Extending Child Benefit entitlement to parents of full time students in second level education to include 18 year olds would not be a targeted approach given the universality of Child Benefit.  The adoption of such a proposal would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p>  <p>  - qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p>  <p>  - the working family payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) for low-paid employees with children;</p>  <p>  - the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second-level education rate).</p>  <p>  As part of the measures under Budget 2018, the qualified child payment which is paid each week to families with children will increase from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 for each child.  This is an increase of 6.7%, and will benefit over 400,000 children.</p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment earnings thresholds were increased by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children.  This will particularly benefit low-income working families.</p>  <p>  These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

The rate bands in place between 2000 and 2012 were more generous than those in place before and after that period, and were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension were maintained.  Instead of reducing those payments, which many vulnerable pensioners were solely reliant upon, the rates paid to new pensioners who both have additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, for a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions, the new rate of payment introduced in 2012 was still higher than the maximum rate that was in place at the start of 2006.  Also, it should be noted that in all European countries and beyond, pension reforms have been introduced to make them more sustainable, and these will generally result in people having different payments depending upon when they reach pension age.  The only way to avoid this would be to introduce the reforms for existing pensioners, and decrease the incomes pensioners have become dependent upon.</p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EU countries.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year. </p>  <p>  The Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the rate bands not been amended in 2012. </p>  <p>  As soon as the report is finished I intend to bring it to a cabinet committee meeting and subsequently to Government for consideration early in the New Year.</p>  <p>  If there are equitable changes that target relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, especially if they had home-making periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will ask Government to consider if and how these might be financed. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid would more closely reflect the total number of Social Insurance contributions made by a person throughout her or his working life and the incongruities of the Yearly Averaging method of calculating entitlement would be removed.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. </p>  <p>  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include employment programmes such as Community Employment (CE).  The purpose of CE is to help a person re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  Participation limits are in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme and to meet the scheme&rsquo;s objectives of breaking the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.</p><p>International evidence does not advocate a long-term dependency on work programmes.  While it is accepted that these schemes serve a role in times of high unemployment, the evidence points to longer duration participation being prone to &lsquo;locking&rsquo; unemployed people into programmes, rather than engaging them to actively search for jobs.  </p><p>Following the publication of my Department&rsquo;s Report - An Analysis of the Community Employment (CE) Programme &ndash; earlier in the year, the Government approved a number of changes to the terms and conditions around participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register, to standardise eligibility and other conditions regarding the length of time a person can participate on the programme and to promote progression outcomes. </p><p>The changes, which are effective since early<sup></sup>July 2017, have seen the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is also now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years can avail of one year on the programme, this can be extended on approval by my Department by up to 2 more years if they are working towards a major award/industry recognised equivalent to support their progression to employment.  CE participants aged 55 and over can now avail of up to 3 consecutive years on a scheme.  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to CE participants (7 years if on a disability payment).  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, provided they have not reached their 6 year overall lifetime limit.</p><p>This Government is also very conscious of the valuable contribution that programmes such as CE are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

On the basis of current legislative provisions that provide for a maximum payment period of 104 weeks, the payment is due to end in July 2018.  Carer&rsquo;s benefit is an income support payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and who have recently left the workforce, or have reduced their hours of work to 15 hours per week or less, and are looking after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.  A person applying for carers benefit must meet the conditions for receipt of the payment.  Only one carer&rsquo;s benefit payment is paid in respect of an individual recipient of care.  The suggestion that &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; may be transferred between persons for the purposes of qualifying for carers benefit is contrary to the general principle of the social insurance system where entitlement to a payment is generally linked with a person&rsquo;s own social insurance contributions and whether they themselves meet the conditions for the payment.  The issue of joint assessment is a matter for the tax code and is not relevant to the question of entitlement for social insurance payments.</p><p>The Department does provide support to carers through a number of other payments.  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.

The duration requirement of 15 months (or 390 days for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, as the cumulative total of days is based on a six day week) has been in place since then.  There has been no change to the duration criteria.  </p>  <p>  The bonus is paid to long-term recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in recognition of their long-term financial dependence on the social welfare payment for all or most of their income. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that time spent on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit prior to receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is taken into account in calculating the duration of unemployment.  In addition, in cases where a person ceases their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to take up work but the work ends and the person signs on to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment again within one year, there is no break in the cumulative total days of unemployment.  In this regard, taking up temporary employment does not have a negative impact on the person&rsquo;s eligibility for the Bonus.</p></reply>

This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime and, very importantly, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed people.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit.  </p>  <p>  Since March 2017, the self-employed have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements were also extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits. </p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors are now eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers with insufficient means can access means tested payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, in respect of periods when they cannot work because of a downturn in their business or ill health.  Self-employed workers who are parenting alone can claim the One Parent Family Payment in the same manner as employees who are parenting alone.</p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme aims to help families, including self-employed families, to move from social welfare into employment. It gives financial support to people with qualified children who are in or take up employment or self-employment and as a result stop claiming a jobseeker's payment or a one-parent family payment.</p>  <p>  The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependent on certain social welfare payments to develop a business, while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years (100% in year one and 75% in year two).  In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to the BTWEA is 12 months in receipt of a jobseekers payment, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA).  Jobseekers who were previously self-employed, similar to PAYE workers, may access social welfare supports, including BTWEA, by establishing eligibility to JA.   </p>  <p>  The short term enterprise allowance provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

There will be no job losses for those working in the services, no diminution of existing services, no closures of service delivery points, and crucially, no disruption to services for those who use them.</p>  <p>  CIB has taken this decision following years of analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model. </p>  <p>  The first phase of CIB&rsquo;s implementation of its new governance arrangements is underway in South Dublin, North Leinster (Kildare, Longford, Louth, Meath and Westmeath) and South Munster (Cork &amp;amp; Kerry).

Information sessions are being organised for Chairpersons of local services, providing an opportunity for Chairpersons to seek clarifications on the process of transfer to the new regional companies and wind up of the existing companies.  </p>  <p>  Implementation of the new governance arrangements is expected to take up to two years to complete, with an estimated net cost to the Exchequer of &euro;4.1 million in present values, over 8 years.  Initial set up costs are estimated to be &euro;1.94 million.</p>  <p>  The aim of the change is to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management and governance of CIS and MABS networks, which are 100% State-funded.

In 2017, the scheme was recently activated to provide support to householders affected following the flooding in County Donegal in August and in County Laois in November where payments are continuing to be made.

In the case of individuals who have more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  </p>  <p>  Prior to 2013, exemptions from PRSI applied to the self-employed income of specific groups.  These exemptions have since been abolished. </p>  <p>  Since 2013, modified rate employees contributors (i.e. civil and public servants recruited prior to 1995) who also have earned self-employed income or unearned income over &euro;5,000 per annum are liable to pay PRSI on that income which was previously exempt.  This income is liable at the class K rate of 4%.  Entitlement to social insurance benefits does not accrue from the payment of this charge.  </p>  <p>  Since 2014, all employees (in the public and private sector) and occupational pensioners under 66 years, with unearned income only, are liable to pay Class K PRSI on that annual unearned income where it exceeds &euro;5,000.  Class K PRSI is charged at 4% and does not give access to social insurance entitlements based on the payment of the charge.  Prior to 2014 these employees were exempt from PRSI on such unearned income, which includes rental and investment income, dividends and interest on deposits.  This provision applies to all employees, regardless of the PRSI class they pay on their employment income.  </p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment. If an employee has income from self-employment e.g. taxi driver, farmer etc. he or she also pays PRSI as a self-employed contributor on the profits from, say, the taxi driving plus any other unearned income he or she might have e.g. rental income.  The measure to charge class K PRSI on employees who were previously exempt was introduced to ensure equity by ensuring that PRSI is chargeable, regardless of the source of the employee&rsquo;s additional income.  </p>  <p>  Employees paying class K PRSI on unearned income can generate entitlement to social insurance benefits based on PRSI they pay on their employment income.  Class A employees with unearned income already have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, because of their PRSI class A status.  Modified rate employees have access to a limited range of social insurance benefits but have entitlement to generous Exchequer-funded occupational pensions.</p></reply>

The CE project year is divided into 13 four-week pay cycles.  As part of the contract, the CE project is given an advance payment at the project commencement (called the Initial Grant) equivalent to 8 weeks estimated wages to cover the initial wages for the Supervisor and participants (who are paid on a current week basis) and other set-up costs (insurance costs, start-up materials, training etc.).  The CE project Sponsor can claim the actual wages paid out in each 4-week cycle at the end of that cycle.  The advance payment/Initial Grant is clawed back in tranches over the last 4 cycles.  At the end of each CE project contract, the Sponsor must have a record of all financial transactions of the project presented in a coherent manner.  These records must be supported by the submission of an independent, professionally certified, audited Statement of Income and Expenditure known as the CE project&rsquo;s audit.  Under the CE procedures the CE project audit is required to be submitted to the Department within four weeks after the finish date of the CE project contract.  As the CE project audit is submitted to the Department after the finish date of a CE project contract it does not impact upon the renewal of a CE project contract.</p>  <p>  The requirement under the CE Procedures for an annual audit reflects the fact that funding for CE comes from the Exchequer and the Department is answerable to the Government, the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee for the administration of this funding.  The Cycle 13 payment is withheld pending review of the CE projects submitted audit following which a final balancing payment is issued by the Department.</p></reply>

In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Credits may also enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC), but only where the individual has already met the condition relating to the minimum number of paid contributions.</p>  <p>  To qualify for credits an individual must satisfy entitlement to the credits scheme.  While there are no self-employed credits, individuals who were previously employed can access the scheme in the same manner as other workers, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.  In general credits can only be awarded where an individual has had a recent attachment to the workforce as an employee i.e. within the last 2 years.  Therefore credits are not automatically awarded to all recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring on a full-time basis, including those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance may, however, qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers to protect their SPC entitlement, and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It applies to the self-employed on the same basis as it does to other workers.	</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC.  In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.</p>  <p>  As credits impact on social insurance entitlements, extending credits would have financial implications for the cost of paying social insurance benefits.  Such an extension would have to considered in the Budgetary context of what additional costs would arise and how such costs could be met.</p></reply>

Under this approach, the rate of pension paid would more closely reflect the total number of Social Insurance contributions made by a person throughout her or his working life and the incongruities of the Yearly Averaging method of calculating entitlement would be removed. </p>  <p>  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020.  I intend that its design will include significant homemaker&rsquo;s provisions to assist those pensioners who spent considerable periods caring for their children, or caring for adults with a caring need.  </p>  <p>  A proposal for the precise method of how the Total Contributions Approach will be implemented is currently being finalised by officials in my Department, having recently received the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund.

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  </p>  <p>  During 2014, my Department engaged with Sligo County Council on the need to address the unsustainable revenue deficit in that local authority.  In this regard, an engagement began between my Department and Sligo County Council in relation to putting in place a financial plan to improve the finances of the Council.  As part of this process, my Department agreed to the payment of &euro;1m to Sligo County Council, subject to the preparation of a financial plan, which charted a path to long-term financial sustainability, being agreed between my Department and the Council prior to the end of 2014.  Following a meeting with my Department on 27 March 2014, wherein a draft financial plan was submitted, it was decided to provide Sligo County Council with &euro;250,000 of this &euro;1m.  In the absence of a detailed plan being finally agreed before the end of 2014 no further payment was made to Sligo in respect of 2014.  This withdrawal of the remaining &euro;750,000 was formally confirmed to Sligo County Council by the then Minister in a meeting with officials and elected members of Sligo County Council on 3rd February 2015.  No commitment to remit this &euro;750,000 was subsequently given either at the meeting of 7 September 2016 or in the intervening period or at any time since.  </p>  <p>  A similar amount of &euro;1m was included in the 2015 Local Property Tax allocation to Sligo County Council.  Payment of this again remained conditional on a plan being agreed and discussions with the Council, in this context, continued.  A financial plan was subsequently agreed and an additional &euro;1m was paid in December 2015.  </p>  <p>  On 7 July 2016, eight months after the plan was agreed, Sligo County Council advised my Department that its surplus target for 2016 would not be met, and that the surplus would fall short of the &euro;2.3 million target agreed the previous November by &euro;1.092 million.  My Department accommodated this change, with the target for 2016 revised down from &euro;2.3m to &euro;1.598m.  Sligo County Council confirmed, in its letter of 13 October 2016, that it had the ability to meet the revised target for 2016 but would not be able to meet the target of &euro;3.41 million planned for 2017.  On 4 November 2016 it confirmed that it was budgeting for a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.6m.  On 20 December 2016 it further reduced the surplus envisaged for future years to a maximum of &euro;1.6m per annum, and requested that timescales be reviewed.  In its letter of 12 April 2017 it advised that the maximum annual sustainable surplus was &euro;600k, and outlined three options for adjustments to timescales.  My Department accepted a timescale to 2027 which would see surpluses of &euro;600k generated each year between 2018 and 2027, notwithstanding the fact that this represents a considerable reduction on the original targets proposed of &euro;3.11 million for 2018 and &euro;2.81 million for 2019.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1m was paid by my Department in both December 2016 and December 2017 when revised targets were met.  My Department has provided for further payment of &euro;200k per annum additional funding to Sligo County Council each year over a 10 year period from 2018 subject to Ministerial approval and any possible changes in Government policy over the intervening period.  Overall, this amounts to a total of &euro;5.25m additional funding to Sligo County Council.  </p></reply>

In general, to exercise their right to vote, all such persons must be ordinarily resident in the State, have reached the age of 18 years and be registered on the register of electors for the constituency or local electoral area in which they ordinarily reside.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the residency requirement, a person shall be deemed not to have given up their ordinary residence if they intend to resume residence within eighteen months after giving it up, under section 11(3) of the Electoral Act 1992.  However, section 149 of the Electoral Act 1992 provides that a person who is included in a register of electors that is currently in force but who is not entitled to be so included in the register shall be guilty of an offence if they vote.  There is a responsibility on each individual who votes to ensure that they are entitled to do so.  </p>  <p>  In response to the evolving needs of Irish society and its relationship with the wider Irish diaspora, the Government agreed in March of this year to accept in principle the main recommendation in the Fifth Report of the Convention on the Constitution that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote at Presidential elections and that a referendum would be held to amend the Constitution to give effect to this.  </p>  <p>  In order to inform public discourse on this significant policy change, an Options Paper was published on 22 March 2017 by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Options Paper sets out a range of options as well as many of the legal, policy and logistical challenges associated with extending voting rights to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The Options Paper also provided a basis for the discussion on voting rights which took place at the Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin on 5 May 2017.  These discussions will inform the Government&rsquo;s decision on a preferred option to be put to the people in a referendum.  </p>  <p>  Even if a referendum was held immediately and passed, it would not be feasible to have comprehensive arrangements in place for an extension of the franchise to have effect for any presidential election to be held before 2025 as this will require modernisation of the voter registration process and the introduction of arrangements to facilitate those eligible to vote to exercise their franchise from outside the State.  In this regard, my Department has commenced work to effect improvements in, and to modernise, the process for the registration of voters.  All aspects of voter registration will be reviewed as part of this project.  </p>  <p>  The Government announced on 26 September 2017 that it has agreed indicative dates for the holding of referendums in 2018 and 2019, subject to the timely passage of Constitution Amendment Bills by each House of the Oireachtas.  Included in the list is the proposed referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State which it is intended will be held on the date of the local and European elections in June 2019.  My Department will bring forward an appropriate Constitution Amendment Bill on extending the franchise at Presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State in good time for the holding of the referendum.  </p></reply>

HAP addresses many long standing issues raised by landlord groups in relation to the operation of Rent Supplement.  The HAP payment is made directly to landlords on the tenant's behalf and all payments are made electronically - the landlord does not have to collect the rent.  There are minimal barriers to setting up HAP, and tax compliance and private rental inspections can follow the setting up of a HAP tenancy.  In 2016, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants and local authorities, and a 99% rent payment rate with virtually no difficulties arising for landlords.  Furthermore, any household assessed for social housing support is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent; under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment.  </p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments, including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Further information is available on the Commission's website, .  </p><p>A number of cases have been taken under the 'housing assistance' ground of the Equality Act against landlords.  I believe that the body of case law that the Workplace Relations Commission is building in this regard complements the clarity that my Department is working to provide to landlords and agents in relation to the operation of the HAP scheme.  It is clear that such cases are rare and the vast majority of landlords are happy to engage in the scheme, and adhere to the terms and conditions.  In fact, the average number of new additional tenancies being supported by HAP per week over the last number of months is close to 350.  </p><p>Misunderstanding of the scheme can arise and this highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents.  </p><p>HAP is working for both recipients and landlords.  Over 30,700 eligible households are currently being supported across the State with over 20,000 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme and receiving housing assistance payments.  HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long term housing needs immediately their need arises.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  </p></reply>

The Initiative was set up on a time-bound basis in order to both better understand and stimulate the taking-in-charge process, due to the backlog of estates waiting to be taken in charge.  </p><p>Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10m in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for funding proposals.  &euro;7.7 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 units.  </p><p>Louth County Council did not make an application to my Department for funding under this programme.  </p><p>It is important to note that the NTICI was not intended to establish a rolling annual funding programme to take-in-charge all estates not yet taken-in-charge, but was instead intended to develop better knowledge and systems to support the taking-in-charge of further estates over time.  Therefore, there is no corresponding funding line after 2016.  </p><p>A report on the 2016 NTICI is currently being finalised by my Department which will help to inform future taking-in-charge plans.  It is envisaged that the report will be published in Q1 2018.  </p><p>With regard to the number of housing estates in each county that have not yet been taken in charge due to no bond being in place, I expect that data of this nature will be published as part of the 2016 NTICI report.  </p></reply>

Further, section 18(3) of the Acts provides that it &ldquo;shall be the duty of every person, being on premises to which section 18 of the Acts applies, to conduct himself in such a way as to ensure that as far as is reasonably practicable any person on the premises is not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of any act or omission of his&rdquo;.  </p><p>Standards for the design and construction of buildings, including fire safety standards, are regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including fire safety, rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  </p><p>As outlined above, the State regulates fire safety responsibility through its Building Control legislation and Fire Services Acts and associated regulations.  A range of enabling powers, including extensive powers of inspection and enforcement, are provided for local authorities under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003.  </p><p>Fire safety is achieved through the &ldquo;Prevent, Protect, Respond&rdquo; paradigm which is part of an overall fire risk management approach.  Local authorities provide a range of services aimed at enhancing fire safety in their communities by preventing fires from happening in the first instance, and ensuring appropriate fire protection measures are in place in buildings, in addition to providing an operational response.  </p><p>The fire prevention/protection work falls into two categories known as Community Fire Safety and Technical Fire Safety. Community Fire Safety involves fire authorities working in partnership with relevant agencies and the community sector to provide safety measures such as domestic smoke alarms for those perceived as most vulnerable to fire in the home.  It also includes the Primary Schools Program whereby every third class in primary school receives age-appropriate education on fire safety issues.  The shift of emphasis to Community Fire Safety is seen as contributing to the overall downward trend in fire fatalities which reached a 40 year record low in 2016.  In relation to the Technical fire safety work, local authority fire services review and make recommendations in relation to applications for Fire Safety Certificates under Building Control legislation.  They also provide the fire safety input under various licensing systems.  They undertake inspection programmes in accordance with their established priorities (such as nursing homes) and they respond to complaints about fire safety in specific premises, using the various enforcement powers as appropriate.  </p><p>In April 2016, my Department published the report of the first External Validation process undertaken in relation to local authority fire services including fire safety, which was titled &quot;Local Delivery - National Consistency&quot;.  This report is available on my Department's website at the following link: .  </p><p>In response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June this year and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, on 27 June 2017, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was tasked with convening and coordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety.  The Task Force is reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.  As it carries out its work, the Task Force is taking into account information and developments arising in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.  </p><p>In addition to establishing the Task Force, local authorities were requested to undertake a number of initial actions and the Task Force was requested to oversee and report on a review of fire safety in both social housing and fire safety in medium to high rise buildings.  This initial work has been carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested.  The Fire Safety Task Force  is analysing the returns received currently and is preparing an initial report which I expect to be submitted by early January 2018.  </p></reply>

The new Abhaile Service, accessed via MABS, can assist shared ownership borrowers who are in arrears to access free independent expert financial and legal advice.  Full details of the supports offered by the Abhaile Service are available from .  Under the restructuring option, where shared ownership borrowers require financial and legal advice outside of that provided via MABS, local authorities will arrange to pay the cost of these fees to a maximum of &euro;1,000, excluding VAT.  Detailed guidance, training and direction have been provided by my Department and the Housing Agency to local authorities regarding the implementation of the measure and my Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the new measure for borrowers. </p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with shared ownership arrangements are available from their local authority.  Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulties making the repayments on their shared ownership arrangement.  Information in relation to the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p></reply>

It has been the subject of European Council and Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions over the past six months which have been debated and discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and its Committees.  Parliamentary Questions have been frequently answered, a Seanad &Eacute;ireann Commencement Matter was taken on 21 November, 2017 and a D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann Topical Debate taken, also on the 21st November.  On 06 December, 2017, I attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence at which I fully set out the position on Ireland's intended participation in PESCO and answered questions from members.   </p>  <p>  It is also worth recalling that PESCO was comprehensively debated in the context of the Lisbon Treaty which was approved by the Irish People when they voted on the Treaty in October 2009.  PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon Treaty Protocol to address the concerns of the Irish People and in Ireland&rsquo;s national declaration.  The Legislation setting down Ireland&rsquo;s approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that Vote and enacted in November 2009.   </p></reply>

In order to fill vacancies there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.</p><p>As I have previously outlined there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities.  I understand that he retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland.</p><p>To address such issues a range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. </p><p>In addition to my commitment to maximising recruitment I am cognisant of factors that can influence retention of existing members of the Defence Forces.  I remain dedicated to ensuring that the terms and conditions of service, while remaining appropriate to the needs of the organisation, are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  The Defence Forces Climate Survey identified a range of issues that were identified as impacting on satisfaction levels within the PDF.  Whilst pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces was highlighted as an issue, there were a broad range of HR matters raised.  I am satisfied that these are being addressed and I have recently announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study. In addition the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces. </p><p>Following sign up by the Defence Forces Representative Associations to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, members of the Permanent Defence Force have benefited from pay increases.  These post-dated the Climate Survey.  I was particularly pleased with recent adjustments to salary scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold and this is under consideration by RACO and PDFORRA. </p><p>The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development. </p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.</p><p><b>Establishment Vs Strength (WTE) &ndash; 31 October 2017</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Lt Gen </th><th>Maj Gen </th><th>Brig Gen </th><th>Col </th><th>Lt Col </th><th>Comdt </th><th>Capt </th><th>Lt </th></tr><tr><td>Army Rank Establishment </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>6 </td><td>35 </td><td>110 </td><td>257 </td><td>306 </td><td>167 </td></tr><tr><td>Army Strength </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>6 </td><td>35 </td><td>103 </td><td>248 </td><td>263 </td><td>113 </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>7 </td><td>9 </td><td>43 </td><td>54 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps Rank Establishment </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>14 </td><td>36 </td><td>65 </td><td>48 </td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps Strength </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>13 </td><td>33 </td><td>48 </td><td>27 </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>3 </td><td>17 </td><td>21 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service Rank Establishment </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>13 </td><td>45 </td><td>81 </td><td>41 </td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service Strength </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>13 </td><td>50 </td><td>56 </td><td>39 </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>-5 </td><td>25 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Total Vacancies by Rank </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>8 </td><td>7 </td><td>85 </td><td>77 </td></tr></table><table><tr><th></th><th>SM </th><th>BQMS </th><th>CS </th><th>CQMS </th><th>Sgt </th><th>Cpl </th><th>Pte/Cadet  </th></tr><tr><td>Army Rank Establishment </td><td>29 </td><td>32 </td><td>115 </td><td>169 </td><td>973 </td><td>1,438 </td><td>3,880 </td></tr><tr><td>Army Strength </td><td>25 </td><td>25 </td><td>83 </td><td>139 </td><td>804 </td><td>1,333 </td><td>4,237 * </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>4 </td><td>7 </td><td>32 </td><td>30 </td><td>169 </td><td>105 </td><td>-357 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps Rank Establishment </td><td>8 </td><td>4 </td><td>56 </td><td>14 </td><td>131 </td><td>183 </td><td>324 </td></tr><tr><td>Air Corps Strength </td><td>7 </td><td>3 </td><td>51 </td><td>10 </td><td>102 </td><td>150 </td><td>297 ** </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>5 </td><td>4 </td><td>29 </td><td>33 </td><td>27 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service Rank Establishment </td><td>6 </td><td>7 </td><td>75 </td><td>15 </td><td>226 </td><td>180 </td><td>402 </td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service Strength </td><td>6 </td><td>8 </td><td>73 </td><td>14 </td><td>172 </td><td>114 </td><td>510 *** </td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies by Rank </td><td>0 </td><td>-1 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>54 </td><td>66 </td><td>-108 </td></tr><tr><td>Total Vacancies by Rank </td><td>5 </td><td>7 </td><td>39 </td><td>35 </td><td>252 </td><td>204 </td><td>-438 </td></tr></table></p><p>*Includes 151 Cadets</p><p>**Includes 38 Cadets</p><p>***Includes 24 Cadets</p></reply>

The Defence Forces deliver military training programmes and modules meeting national and international standards.

This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as severe weather events or terrorist attacks rests with the three designated principal response agencies, namely, the relevant Local Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power roles. </p>  <p>  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills and equipment, which can be deployed in such circumstances.

T he main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 377 personnel, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 136 personnel and the United Nations mandated Naval Service deployment to the EU naval mission (Operation Sophia) which commenced in October 2017 with 55 naval personnel. </p><p>Ireland has, in addition, pledged to the United Nations Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System to make certain additional capabilities (troops and equipment) available to the United Nations on request.  Also, at the United Nations Defence Ministerial summit held in Vancouver last month, Ireland pledged certain training capabilities for delivery in Ireland and in partner countries overseas.  Any additional deployments will be subject to the provision of the Defence Acts and the triple lock as appropriate. Ireland will continue to work with the United Nations to make peacekeeping operations as efficient and effective as possible. </p><p>The overall current contribution of some 639 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the United Nations and to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p>Details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following table:</p><p><b>Members of the Permanent Defence Force Serving Overseas as of 1st December 2017 </b><table><tr><th>1.

Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.</p><p>In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas. </p><p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft is underway and the cost will be determined by the outcome of the tender competition which is expected to conclude shortly. </p><p>  The two Air Corps CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019. The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. </p><p>  Also, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft and this aircraft was delivered from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland in July 2017 at a cost of &euro;5m exclusive of VAT.  The new aircraft brings the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps. </p></reply>

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s fishery protection legislation and our obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role, the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol at any one time.  However, when on patrol Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties.</p>  <p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps&rsquo; Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance within the Irish EEZ using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service.  The EU has provided funding towards the cost of purchase and upgrade of these aircraft.   </p>  <p>  My officials together with the Naval Service and the Air Corps are working closely with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), who are the competent authority on this matter, in relation to Brexit.  However, the implications, as they relate to air and sea surveillance along the Irish Coast, of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union will depend on the manner in which, and under what circumstances the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. </p>  <p>  The potential implications for fisheries protection and monitoring of Irish waters will emerge during the course of current negotiations. Accordingly, it is difficult at this stage to anticipate the implications including the impact on fishery protection requirements. </p></reply>

In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role.  The Government has also assigned a formal role to the Reserve of contributing to state ceremonial events.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve. </p><p>I am aware that there is a shortfall between these figures and those of the established strength, which provides for 4,069 personnel. As an immediate measure to begin to rectify this shortfall by bolstering the strength of the Reserve, a recruitment campaign to the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications.  A total of 128 personnel have been inducted to the Reserve Defence Forces in 2017 which is an increase of some 60% when compared to the 80 personnel inducted in 2016.  The recruitment process has also been streamlined so as to make it more efficient.</p><p>Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing.  However, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces recruitment and the recruitment of up to 800 Permanent Defence Forces personnel this year obviously impacted on resource allocation.</p><p>Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two relate specifically to the RDF.  One addresses the issue of improving the strength of the Reserve by attracting recruits from all backgrounds.  The other action involves conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.  Both of these are well advanced. In the medium term, over the 10 year lifespan of the White Paper, other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will also be examined and developed by the Defence Organisation. </p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper on Defence and having regard to resource availability.</p></reply>

Three ships have been delivered since 2014 and a fourth is due to be delivered by 2018.</p><p>The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with larger and more capable fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance).  Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft.</p><p>The Army&rsquo;s fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers mid-life upgrade will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower.  Additionally, updated 4x4 Armoured Utility Vehicle are being acquired and it is planned to take delivery in 2018 of new armoured logistic vehicles.  These measures will also enhance force protection overseas.</p><p>The examples given above, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  As part of budgetary negotiations for 2017, additional capital funding was allocatedbringing the capital envelope up to &euro;416m over the 2018-2021 timeframe.  This will allow for significant investment in equipment and infrastructure over the coming years.</p><p>The primary function of training and education in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the military capabilities necessary to fulfil the roles laid down by Government and to respond too future threats to the State&rsquo;s security.</p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy has been adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021. </p><p>In relation to Personnel, up to the end of October 2017 there have been 702 personnel inducted into the Defence Forces.  This is an increase from the 416 inducted in 2015 and 690 in 2016.  In 2016 more people were brought into the Defence Forces than left (690 in; 655 out).  This reversed a long term trend of more people leaving than entering the Defence Forces.  This has been possible because this Government significantly increased recruitment and it is expected that new entrants will again exceed exits in 2017.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.  This includes the provision of relevant assistance in response to emergency situations that may arise.</p></reply>

Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.</p>  <p>  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles have also been procured for force protection.  Modern secure communications are essential for overseas missions and in that regard Defence Force personnel are suitably equipped with required communications and global positioning systems equipment.  As stated in the White Paper, should additional funding beyond that required to maintain existing Air Corps&rsquo; capabilities become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability is a priority for the Air Corps.  Funding for this is not provided in the current resource envelope and any future decisions in this regard will be in the context of the ongoing security environment and any associated developments.    </p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises the requirement to maintain and upgrade Naval Service vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology, including communications equipment and technology and this is an ongoing process.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>
